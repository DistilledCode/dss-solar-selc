            "articleBody": "BERLIN: Germany will block the planned sale of Volkswagen subsidiary MAN Energy Solutions' gas turbine division to a Chinese company, two government sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The government is expected to rubber-stamp the decision at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the people said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. GHGT belongs to the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), which dominates the Chinese shipbuilding industry. MAN Energy Solutions said last September that the German government would take a closer look at the planned sale to Chinese state-owned CSIC Longjiang GH Gas Turbine Co (GHGT), which was first announced in June 2023 at an undisclosed price. Germany's Economy Ministry, which has the right to critically review and block transactions with regard to their implications for national security, declined to comment. Volkswagen and MAN Energy Solutions were not immediately available for comment.

This will be the first time in India that such a tender would be floated on this scale, Gupta told reporters on the sidelines of India Energy Storage Week 2024, organised by India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) on Wednesday.  \"The tender is expected to be out by the end of this financial year 2024-25. There have been (solar thermal) tenders but not of this scale,\" Gupta said in reply to a question on new solar thermal tenders.  The earlier tenders were small in size and their costs were also too high, he said.  The projects under the 500 MW tender will have advanced technology where steam would be generated through heat and it would also help in running turbines, he added.  Besides, the prices will be at par with other Round the Clock (RTC) solutions, Gupta said without elaborating further.  Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) is a nodal agency of the central government for auctioning renewable energy projects. RTC projects include solar wind capacity with battery storage.",

            "articleBody": "The gap in demand for electric vehicles between large and mid-sized cities in the country is shrinking and the Tier-II 2 cities are likely to emerge as the next big demand centre for EVs, a report said on Tuesday. An analysis of the electric two-wheeler and car sales by strategic research provider BloombergNEF (BNEF) from 207 cities across 10 states also suggests that the electric two-wheeler sales in some tier 2 markets have surpassed metropolitans while within tier 2 cities, state capitals generally leading the growth in electric car sales. India's electric vehicle sales are growing rapidly but vary considerably across the country's 36 states and union territories. While wealthier, populous and more developed tier 1 cities are the current hubs of India's EV demand, adoption in tier 2 cities is growing, BloombergNEF said in its report. The states covered under the report include Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. A potentially large auto market and the expansion strategies of EV makers could make these tier 2 cities the next big demand centre for EVs while in smaller cities with limited awareness and disposable income, policy support will be crucial in amplifying EV sales, it said.  According to the report, Karnataka capital Bengaluru is ahead of other tier 1 cities in EV adoption -both in the passenger vehicle and two-wheeler segments with the EV growth in the wealthier cities being driven by several factors, such as a young demographic with regular disposable income, the expanding presence of pure-play EV cab operators and increasing availability of EV models to choose from.  On the other hand, Rajasthan's capital Jaipur accounted for more than 79 per cent of all electric cars sold in the state's five tier 2 cities that were analysed. Consumers in Jaipur bought more than 2,400 electric cars in 2023, more than doubling from the less than 1,000 vehicles sold a year earlier, it said.  Similarly, UP capital city Lucknow led the state's stellar sales growth in 2023, with demand reaching 1,120 units while Kerala's capital Thiruvananthapuram was at the forefront of sales numbers in the state with 840 electric cars sold and Gurugram, a fast-growing city that shares a border with the national capital Delhi, saw nearly 1,570 electric cars getting sold in 2023, it said.  Noting that most of India's tier 2 cities do not have a robust EV ride-hailing market yet which is a key pillar of rising EV sales in tier 1 cities, the report said that this means EV sales in smaller cities are entirely driven by private uptake.  Most private electric cars purchased in 2023 were not supported by upfront price subsidies. Just two out of the top 10 states for annual electric car sales had active subsidies as of the end of 2023. Even after several states exhausted their subsidy limit by the middle of the year, sales continued to hold steady, as per the report.  Stating that the annual growth rates of high-speed electric two-wheeler sales in tier 2 and tier 3 cities across the 10 states surpassed those in tier 1 cities, it said that In 2023, the annual rate of increase of total EVs sold in 70 tier 2 cities and 131 tier 3 cities was 51 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Electric two-wheeler markets in several tier 2 cities are far ahead of those in tier 1 cities. In 2023, electric two-wheelers sold in Surat (20,150 vehicles) and Jaipur (18,600) exceeded those in Ahmedabad (17,300), Mumbai (13,800) and Chennai (13,710) while the sales in Nagpur (13,730) were close to those in the state capital, Mumbai, it said. Kolhapur and Indore are also quickly catching up, with sales reaching 9,320 and 9,200 vehicles, respectively, in 2023, as per the report. Tier 2 cities could be the next growth drivers for electric two-wheelers, but financial support is crucial in tier 3 cities, Bloomberg NEF said. In 2023, the growth rate of the two-wheeler market in tier 2 cities was similar to that in tier 1. Automakers are rapidly expanding their sales and dealership networks in smaller cities, which will help improve consumer awareness and access to these vehicles, it said.  As the focus shifts to boosting demand from less affluent tier 3 cities, demand-side policy support, especially financial subsidies, will be needed unless prices fall fast enough for EVs to achieve upfront cost parity with gasoline vehicles, the report stated.",

            "articleBody": "Tangier: After the United States passed new subsidies designed to boost domestic electric vehicle production and cut into Beijing's supply chain dominance, Chinese manufacturers began investing in an unlikely place: Morocco. In the rolling hills near Tangiers and in industrial parks near the Atlantic Ocean, they have announced plans for new factories to make parts for EVs that may qualify for USD 7,500 credits to car buyers in the United States.  Similar investments have been announced in other countries that share free trade agreements with the United States, including South Korea and Mexico.  But few countries have seen the kind of boom that Morocco has.  At least eight Chinese battery makers have announced new investments in the North African kingdom since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the USD 430 billion US law designed to fight climate change, according to an Associated Press tally.  By moving operations to US trading partners like Morocco, Chinese players that have long dominated the battery supply chain are seeking a pathway to cash in on increasing demand from American carmakers like Tesla and General Motors, said Kevin Shang, a senior battery analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.  \"Chinese companies definitely don't want to miss this big party,\" he said.  The United States and European Union have both imposed major new tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports since May.  The United States also finalised eligibility rules governing the tax credits in May. The latter limit companies with ties to US adversaries, but give carmakers time to reduce their reliance on China. To qualify for the subsidies, carmakers cannot source critical minerals or battery parts from manufacturers in which China and other \"foreign entities of concern\" control more than 25 per cent of the company or its board.  Critics say the rules are a giveaway to China and will extend its EV dominance. The Biden administration says the rules pave the way for billions in investment in EV manufacturing in the United States.  Between East and West  In Morocco, a largely agrarian economy where the median income is USD 2,150 a month, giant industrial parks full of American, European and Chinese component makers have sprung up in the rural outskirts of Tangiers, Kenitra and El Jadida.  Expanding on infrastructure that has made Morocco a car manufacturing hub, they hope to meet growing demand and overcome rules designed to exclude them from the incentives the Inflation Reduction Act is injecting into the US car market, the world's second-largest.  The rules \"have led Chinese producers to increase investment in countries with whom the US has free trade agreements, namely South Korea and Morocco, to get past some IRA barriers,\" the policy research firm Rhodium Group said in a report earlier this year.  Some of the new China investments in Morocco explicitly cite the new US subsidies as a reason.  Many are joint ventures that have cited their ability to tinker with board seats and governance to comply with US rules.  That includes CNGR, one of China's largest battery cathode producers, which in September announced a USD 2 billion plan to build what it called a \"base in the world and pan-Atlantic region\" in a joint venture with the Moroccan royal family's investment group, Al Mada.  Though CNGR owns slightly more than a 50 per cent stake in the project, Thorsten Lahrs, CEO of its Europe division, said he's confident its cathodes can qualify for the tax credits and change its board composition if necessary. If not, the company would pivot to other markets, including Europe, which just hiked tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China.  \"To ride the wave of the IRA, you have to execute fast and comply with its regulations,\" he said in an interview before the US finalised its rules. \"We have flexibility to be able to comply with all the changes in interpretation or rules.\"  The Chinese battery projects include at least three joint ventures and several that reference Morocco's trade ties with the United States.  The largest among them is Chinese-German battery-maker Gotion High-Tech, which signed a deal with Morocco last year for USD 6.4 billion investment to construct Africa's first electric vehicle battery factory.  Investments also include Youshan, a joint venture backed by Korean giant LG Chem and China's Huayou Cobalt. It declined to provide details about the size of their investment but said the Morocco base means their cathodes \"will be supplied to the North American market and subsidised by the US Inflation Reduction Act as Morocco is a signatory to the US Free Trade Agreement.\"  LG Chem said the venture would adjust ownership shares as necessary to comply with US rules.  China's BTR Group's announcement of a cathode factory in April noted that Morocco's trade status with the United States and Europe would ensure \"a seamless entry for the majority of its manufactured products into these regions.\"  Abdelmonim Amachraa, a supply chain expert who previously worked in Morocco's Ministry of Industry and Trade, said Morocco was profiting from its \"ability to coexist when a link can't be found between China and the United States.\"  Officials in Morocco have publicly and privately worked to foster ties up and down the automotive supply chain in both the East and the West. The country hosts more than 250 companies that manufacture cars or their components, including Stellantis and Renault as well as Chinese, Japanese, American and Korean factories that make seats, engines, shock absorbers and wheels. The industry exports almost USD 14 billion in cars and parts annually.  As the world transitions to electric vehicles, Morocco may appear to be a surprising beneficiary as China, the United States and Europe compete for market share. But its officials worry that anti-competitive policies like tariffs and subsidies could ultimately make it more difficult to lure investment.  Ryad Mezzour, the country's minister of industry and trade, said in an interview that all the new investment doesn't tell the full story. Morocco has also lost out on some projects due to what he called \"a new age of protectionism.\"  A giant loophole  The investment has been a boon to countries like Morocco. But in Washington, Chinese firms have raised alarm by angling to access the American subsidies.  \"Under the Biden administration's electric vehicle regulations, America's working families will have to watch their hard-earned tax dollars go to line the pockets of Chinese billionaires and businesses with links to the Chinese Communist Party,\" US Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, said of the new guidelines.  But at issue are the complexities of both the electric vehicle supply chain and the Inflation Reduction Act, which seeks to grow adoption of EVs and boost domestic manufacturing, too.  The US Energy and Treasury departments have tried to strike a delicate balance, working to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturers while also ensuring enough vehicles qualify for the credits.  The Department of Energy did not respond to questions about what its rules meant for Chinese investments in countries that share free trade agreements with the United States.  But in a statement, a spokesperson called the transition to electric vehicles \"an industry-wide, global trend\" and said new policies \"help the US strengthen its energy security and competitiveness-including outcompeting China.\"  China has spent years subsidizing companies that extract critical battery minerals, manufacturers of cathodes, anodes and electrolyzers and carmakers like BYD.  Those companies' eagerness to invest in Morocco to cash in on the Inflation Reduction Act shows how decoupling Chinese manufacturers from the supply chain will take years, if not decades, said Chris Berry, an adviser to battery companies and investors.  \"There is not going to be a lithium ion battery supply chain that does not have Chinese influence for a long time,\" Berry said.

Tesla gave no detailed breakdown of the other autos delivered.During the same period it produced 410,831 vehicles, including 386,576 Model 3 and Model Y autos.\"This was a huge comeback performance from Tesla and (Elon) Musk with the Street expecting a clear miss this quarter with EV demand still choppy globally,\" said Wedbush analysts in a note.They expect \"the worst is in the rear-view mirror for Tesla,\" helped by a \"mini rebound\" in China along with price stabilization.Tesla's robotaxi, to be unveiled on August 8, should also launch a new chapter for the automaker, the analysts noted.But Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, cautioned that the decline in Tesla's second quarter deliveries is not a big shock.\"We've seen the automaker exhaust its bag of tricks by lowering prices and increasing incentives to spur demand without much success in the US market,\" she said.She added that \"times are tough for Tesla,\" noting that its sales techniques could have \"long-term negative consequences.\"In a separate statement, GM said Tuesday that it delivered 696,086 units in the United States, up 0.6 percent on-year.But this was a markedly slower pace than last year's 19 percent jump.GM reported a 17 percent rise in retail EV registrations, above the industry's 10 percent gain.On the start-up front, Rivian said Tuesday it produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 in the second quarter -- levels in line with its forecasts.The company saw a stock market boom after German automaker Volkswagen said in June that it was investing $5 billion -- including $1 billion directly in Rivian -- to create a joint venture specializing in automotive software.Nikola, a start-up manufacturer of hydrogen-powered and electric trucks, said it sold 72 hydrogen-powered vehicles in the quarter, exceeding its target of 60.",

            "articleBody": "BANGKOK: Thai authorities are investigating BYD's dealers after a consumer complaint over aggressive discounting in a key international market for the Chinese EV giant that has left some buyers upset with how much they paid for their cars. The office of the Thai Prime Minister instructed the country's consumer protection agency to launch the probe. It was triggered after a BYD customer alleged that a sales representative had asserted the customer's car's price would rise after a discounting campaign ended but instead the dealership later aggressively cut the price further, according to a government statement. BYD officials in Thailand and its sole distributor Rever Automotive, which has a network of over 100 dealerships, did not immediately respond to Reuters emails seeking comment. \"We have called the dealers to come in this week to clarify why they cut prices further and how they plan to find a solution for customers,\" Passakorn Thapmongkol, a senior official at the Consumer Protection Board told Reuters. On a BYD owners group on Facebook, other Thai customers shared similar complaints. \"The salesperson said that prices would increase after the motor show, but in the end, it was really reduced,\" Facebook user Thanasit Chai said in a post on Wednesday, referring to the Bangkok Motor Show held in March. Thailand is the largest overseas market for the world's biggest EV manufacturer. BYD commanded a 46% share of the Thai EV market in the first quarter and is the third-largest player in passenger cars overall with share of about 9%, according to research firm Counterpoint. Other EV rivals in the market include Great Wall Motor and Tesla. BYD is scheduled to open its first EV production facility in Southeast Asia in Thailand's eastern Rayong province on Thursday. It plans to invest around $490 million in the facility to produce 150,000 cars per year. Shenzhen-headquartered BYD currently sells four models in Thailand priced between 699,999 baht and 1.59 million baht ($19,000 to $43,200), according to Rever's website. Led by BYD and Vietnam's VinFast, EV sales in Southeast Asia have more than doubled since last year at the expense of Japanese and Korean makers of traditional gasoline engine models.",

It&rsquo;s the first time the New York-based firm, founded by Nathan Anderson, has provided a tally of its winnings from last year&rsquo;s bombshell report alleging fraud and market manipulation at the Indian business empire of Gautam Adani &mdash; one of Asia&rsquo;s richest tycoons.The contrast between Hindenburg&rsquo;s gains and the wider impact underscores how opportune research can have far-reaching effects, even if it&rsquo;s not always easy to profit from the fallout. Shares and bonds of Adani Group companies swung wildly in the immediate aftermath of Hindenburg&rsquo;s report but have since recovered ground. As of Monday, the group market value was $205 billion &mdash; about $30 billion short of its pre-Hindenburg level.The scathing report earned a gross revenue of about $4.1 million through gains related to Adani shorts from &ldquo;one investor relationship&rdquo; &mdash; Hindenburg didn&rsquo;t name who &mdash; and about &ldquo;$31,000 through our own short of Adani U.S. bonds,&rdquo; according to the short seller&rsquo;s July 1 statement.Hindenburg also called out India&rsquo;s markets regulator for failing to address the fraud allegations in its report last year.Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, &ldquo;seems more interested in pursuing those who expose such practices&rdquo; while its investigation into billionaire Adani&rsquo;s empire has hit a wall, Hindenburg said. Its latest broadside comes at a time when India&rsquo;s newly energized opposition parties have been criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for crony capitalism, after the leader was returned to power with a smaller mandate than expected last month. The firm also posted on its website the full &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; notice it said it received from Sebi in June, which states that Hindenburg&rsquo;s report on the Adani Group had certain misrepresentations and inaccurate statements that were meant to mislead readers. In the 46-page document, Sebi said Hindenburg &ldquo;has resorted to extrapolation and conjecture to emphasize some facts and understate others in favor of negative inference against Adani Group Companies.&rdquo; It also said the short seller cited a broker banned from the securities market, shaking investors&rsquo; trust in the regulatory framework.Adani Group stocks shrugged off the latest missive from Hindenburg. Shares of all 10 Adani-linked firms traded higher on Tuesday, led by the energy and gas units that rallied more than 4% each.&lsquo;Masking Kotak&rsquo;Hindenburg said that Sebi&rsquo;s notice &ldquo;conspicuously&rdquo; failed to mention Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, which it said created and oversaw the offshore fund structure used by Hindenburg&rsquo;s investor partner to bet against Adani. The regulator &ldquo;masked the &lsquo;Kotak&rsquo; name with the acronym &ldquo;KMIL&rdquo;,&rdquo; it added, though Kotak is the body with ties to India. KMIL refers to Kotak Mahindra Investments Ltd, the asset management company. Kotak Mahindra Bank&rsquo;s shares slipped as much as 3% on Tuesday after Hindenburg&rsquo;s disclosures. Kotak said in a statement on Tuesday that Hindenburg has never been a client of Kotak Mahindra International Ltd.Sebi&rsquo;s notice also named US hedge fund Kingdon Capital Management as an involved party, stating that Kingdon knew about Hindenburg&rsquo;s research on the Adani Group before it was published and had a profit-sharing pact with the short-seller on its trades. Hindenburg shared a draft of the Adani report with Kingdon in November 2022, nearly two months before it published the report, according to the Sebi show cause notice. In return Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg. That profit-sharing then got reduced to 25%, due to the cost of setting up these trades.In January the following year, a fund controlled by Mark Kingdon transferred $43 million to the K India Opportunities Fund, which started building short positions via futures for Adani Enterprises Ltd, the conglomerate&rsquo;s flagship listed entity, the cause notice said. These short positions were later squared off by Feb. 22 and reaped $22 million. As of June 1, the Kingdon fund returned $4.1 million of the gains from the Adani short sale to Hindenburg while another $1.4 million has yet to be shared, according to Sebi. In Tuesday&rsquo;s statement, Kotak said Hindenburg has never been an investor in the K India Opportunities Fund. The Indian markets regulator didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to Bloomberg&rsquo;s request for comment. Nor did the Adani Group. Kingdon Capital Management was not immediately reachable outside of US business hours. ",

Germany, whose carmakers made a third of their sales last year in China, wants to stop the tariffs, according to a government source, while France has been among the firmest backers. But a majority of countries are still weighing the pros and cons of the escalating trade spat, according to an informal poll by Reuters of EU governments. The issue will be put to members in an advisory vote in the coming weeks, the first official test of support in a landmark case for the Commission. The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind. The bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6% on Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla, BMW and other western automakers. EU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" if at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them. France, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs. \"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said. However, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.  NEGATIVE EFFECTSGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits. Increasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices. Beijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars. The Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100% tariff is likely to do. Tariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU. Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations. \"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said. The EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show. They point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business. The document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed. It offers proof to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy. That leaves the door open to future cases. \"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\" ",

            "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Sebi has issued a show-cause notice to Hindenburg, asking why it should not act against the short-seller for violating norms related to the \"prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trading practices in the securities market\".The notice, dated June 26, was released online by Hindenburg, which took a defiant stand, charging Sebi with not acting on allegations in its Adani report. Hindenburg described the notice as \"nonsense\" and \"nebulous\" and alleged attempts to silence the firm. Hindenburg claimed it only made $4 million from the operation, which resulted in a $153 billion drop in Adani group's valuation.In a statement, Hindenburg said: \"Sebi has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimised by it.\"The thrust of Sebi's notice is that the research firm colluded with its investor partner, misled the public, and used non-public information to manipulate prices and profit from its action. Sebi has alleged that the partner, Kingdon Capital, knew about Hindenburg's research on Adani group before the report was made public and there was a profit-sharing agreement between the two. As per Sebi, Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg in exchange for receiving the report two months in advance. In a fresh twist in the Hindenburg saga, the US short seller said that Kotak Mahindra International created the offshore fund structure used by its investor partner Kingdon Capital to short Adani stocks before its report was published in Jan 2023. Kotak Mahindra Bank informed stock exchanges late on Tuesday that Sebi's showcause notice to Hindenburg and Kingdon included a fund managed by Kotak Mahindra International (KMIL).\"KMIL was informed by Kingdon that the transactions were made on a principal basis, i.e. for themselves. Kingdon never disclosed that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price sensitive information. In fact, they had expressly confirmed that any advice from Kingdon to invest would be basis purely public information,\" Kotak Bank's statement said.\"Neither the fund nor KMIL were aware that Kingdon entities had any association with Hindenburg. The fund and KMIL had no prior knowledge of the publication of the aforesaid Hindenburg report. We deny any allegation of being aware of such report or acting in collusion in any manner with Kingdon or Hindenburg,\" it said.Earlier in the day, Kotak Bank shares dropped 2.4% after Hindenburg disclosed Sebi's notice and said that a Kotak fund was one of the noticees for setting up the offshore structure. In its exchange communication, Kotak said that the showcause notice dated June 26 was received by KMIL on July 2.In its reply to Sebi's showcause notice, Hindenburg questioned the regulator for not highlighting the name of Kotak, the group that facilitated offshore investors' short-selling in Indian markets.By bringing Kotak into the picture in correspondence with Sebi, Hindenburg has sought to support its claim that the firm played by the rules while short-selling and did not cross a line between using proprietary research based on public information and \"use of advance knowledge of non-public information\" for trading, as the regulator alleged.Hindenburg reply also referred to Kotak group founder, Uday Kotak's chairmanship of 2017 Committee on Corporate Governance to bolster the legitimacy of its actions.\"We suspect Sebi's lack of mention of Kotak or any other Kotak board member may be meant to protect yet another powerful Indian businessman from the prospect of scrutiny, a role Sebi seems to embrace\" Hindenburg said.In a statement, a Kotak group spokesperson said, \"KIOF (K India Opportunities Fund - a Sebi-registered FPI regulated by Financial Services Commission of Mauritius), was established in 2013 to enable foreign clients to invest in India. The fund follows due KYC procedures while on-boarding clients and all its investments are made in accordance with all applicable laws. We have cooperated with regulators in relation to our operations and continue to do so.\"The statement also denied any knowledge of investors' association with Hindenburg. \"KMIL and KIOF unequivocally state that Hindenburg has never been a client of the firm nor has it ever been an investor in the fund.,\" the spokesperson said.",

The new development offers a sustainable solution for environmental clean-up efforts.Led by Dr. Arundhuti Devi, the team at IASST successfully tested the nanocomposite, named Ni-doped TiO2 on Fuller&rsquo;s earth (NiTF), achieving a 96.15 per cent decolorization rate of methylene blue dye under visible light within 90 minutes. This performance was observed at a pH level of 9.0, demonstrating the catalyst's high efficiency in breaking down harmful organic substances in water.The research, published in the journal 'Inorganic Chemistry Communications' by Elsevier, highlights the potential of NiTF not only in environmental applications but also across various industries, including energy storage, sensors, and renewable energy production.The study underscores the role of metal oxide photocatalysis, which utilizes catalysts like titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and tungsten trioxide, known for their ability to generate electron-hole pairs that neutralize pollutants when exposed to light.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India is in talks with Africa as well as Latin America to get critical mineral blocks on a government-to-government basis, Veena Kumari Dermal, joint secretary of the Ministry of Mines, said on Tuesday. Critical minerals such as lithium are essential components in many of today's rapidly growing clean energy technologies, including wind turbines, electricity networks, and electric vehicles.  \"We are having lots of discussions with many other resources-rich countries both in Africa as well as in Latin America for getting... a block on a G2G basis or on a priority basis,\" Dermal said at India Energy Storage Week (IESW) 2024 organised by India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA).  The mines ministry, she said, is giving more and more importance to the exploration of critical minerals in India.  At the domestic front, the government has successfully auctioned one lithium block in Chhattisgarh, the joint secretary added.  She said the Chhattisgarh government will take steps to start the exploration and production from the lithium block at the earliest.  Maiki South Mining Pvt Ltd had last month bagged the country's first lithium block in Chhattisgarh that was put up for sale.  Meanwhile, the government cancelled the auction of 14 critical minerals that were on offer in the second round of auction.  In June, the government had put on sale 21 blocks in the fourth round of auction of critical and strategic minerals.  The government received 56 physical bids and 56 online bids for 18 of the 20 blocks offered during the first tranche of the auction, which began on November 29, 2023.  However, the auction for 13 of the 20 blocks was cancelled due to a lukewarm response.  Seven of these cancelled blocks were re-notified for auction in the third round.",

            "articleBody": "MOSCOW: Russian energy giant Gazprom's average daily natural gas supplies to Europe jumped by almost 23 per cent in June from a year earlier, rebounding from last year's post-Soviet lows, although they fell 8.6 per cent from May, Reuters calculations showed on Tuesday. Exports were lower last month than in the previous month amid planned maintenance at the TurkStream undersea pipeline on June 6-9. The calculations, based on data from the European gas transmission group Entsog and Gazprom's daily reports on gas transit via Ukraine, showed that average daily pipeline exports decreased to 81.8 million cubic metres (mcm) last month from 89.5 mcm in May, but they were up from the 66.8 mcm in June 2023. Gazprom's natural gas exports to Europe this year have totalled about 15.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) so far. Europe was once Russia's primary export market but now receives much less Russian gas as a result of the political response to the conflict in Ukraine. Gazprom has instead boosted gas sales to China, which increased pipeline gas imports from Russia to 22.7 bcm last year, nearly 1.5 times more than the 15.4 bcm shipped in 2022. Gazprom has not published its own monthly statistics since the start of 2023. It did not respond to a request for comment. Russia supplied a total of about 63.8 bcm of gas to Europe by various routes in 2022, according to Gazprom data and Reuters calculations. The volume decreased further, by 55.6 per cent, to 28.3 bcm last year. At their peak in 2018-2019, annual flows to the region reached between 175 bcm and 180 bcm. ",

            "articleBody": "Mercedes-Benz India wants the government to commit to continuity in policies that support electric mobility for the next eight to ten years, for stable and better planning towards zero emission mobility, its Managing Director and CEO Santosh Iyer said on Tuesday. Besides, the company feels that providing the incentives given to electric vehicles to hybrid vehicles will extend the timeline for transition to emission free mobility.  The company, which had increased EV penetration to 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, from 2.5 per cent earlier, expects the momentum to carry going forward with three new EV models slated for launch this year, starting with the EQA next week.  \"A much more clear roadmap when it comes to taxation on EVs,\" Iyer told PTI here when asked about the company's expectations from the upcoming Union Budget.  \"We understand that the Budget may not address the GST topic, but at least if you are able to get a commitment that for the next eight to ten years, this kind of taxation benefit will continue, this will really help brands like us to plan long term and have more commitments when it comes to investments for the EVs,\" he said.  For electric vehicles the government has already given 5 per cent GST compared to 48-50 per cent on internal combustion engines, Iyer added.  Highlighting investment on infrastructure as another key aspect, he said, \"One of the biggest drivers for our growth has been the growing road infrastructure and intercity road infrastructure that has come up in the last couple of years.\"  He further said, \"one big line item that we will see in the Budget is the capital expenditure on infrastructure. We expect (it) to go up if possible, so that not only it helps demand but also the indirect benefits of it for the country also is great.\"  When asked about the discussions on extending the GST benefits given to EVs on hybrid vehicles, Iyer said, \"Currently we can see electric as the only option when it comes to zero emission driving. Now on that road, if we add newer technologies, it will delay the transition, for sure.\"  Iyer further said, \"It is up to the government and the stakeholders to see how soon they want to accelerate the transformation to carbon free mobility and emission free mobility.\" On the company's roadmap for electric mobility, he said it is committed to zero emission mobility but \"the EV transition is a marathon and not a sprint\".  \"We have already three (EV) products in the market with which we achieved 5-6 per cent penetration and we will continue with the EQA (to be launched next week) to further penetrate,\" Iyer said.  Two more EV models will be launched later this year, he added.  In the first quarter of 2024, the company had posted total sales of 5,412 units, growth of 15 per cent from the year-ago period.  On local assembly of EVs in India, Iyer said Mercedes-Benz India will consider other models too depending on demand. It currently assembles EQS at its Chakan plant.",

Speaking at the 2nd CII Conference on Smart Metering, Agarwal emphasized the need for interoperability and data integration of smart meters.Highlighting the importance of storage solutions and forecasting models, Agarwal stressed the necessity of empowering state distribution companies (DISCOMs) for better demand side management. He said, \"The current challenges the power sector is facing include the financial viability of DISCOMs and renewable energy integration. Such issues must be addressed to achieve Prime Minister&rsquo;s vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.\"The conference, themed 'Empowering Future: Accelerating Smart Meter Adoption through Innovation and Collaboration,' saw participation from officials of the Union power ministry, state governments, regulators, meter manufacturers, service providers, and digital companies.Arun Mahesh Babu, Managing Director of Gujarat Power Corp Ltd and UGVCL, underscored the importance of consumer trust in the transition to smart meters. \"Consumers must be convinced of the long-term benefits of transitioning to smart meters, and implementing agencies must work with them to build trust and resolve all queries,\" he stated.Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, co-chairman of the CII National Committee on Power and Managing Director of Apraava Energy, raised concerns about data security. He noted, \"While large data has its benefits, it must be treated with utmost care. Start-ups have a huge opportunity to leverage data to benefit DISCOMs and help consumers manage usage efficiently.\"Dr Suket Singhal, Head of the CII Core Group on Smart Metering and Group CEO of Secure Meters Pvt Ltd, highlighted the advantages of smart meters beyond controlling AT&amp;C losses. He mentioned, \"The focus should be on the 65 per cent of consumers who want to pay but face billing errors. Smart meters will ensure accurate and timely billing.\"The conference, building on the momentum of the first edition in 2022, aims to accelerate the adoption of smart meter infrastructure in India&rsquo;s power sector. It seeks to bring policymakers, regulators, and industry together to create a conducive ecosystem and policies for the implementation of over 18 crore smart meters planned nationwide.Discussions at the conference included topics such as policy and regulatory frameworks for scaling up smart metering, data efficiency and flexibility, securing the meters, and \"Make in India\" initiatives. The event focused on India's commitment to reforming and modernizing the power distribution sector, aiming to establish a robust, resilient, and flexible smart grid network capable of integrating renewable energy sources to meet the country's growing power demand.",

            "articleBody": "Oslo: Norwegian battery recycling firm Hydrovolt said Tuesday that it will expand internationally by opening a facility in France, boosting a nascent hub for producing electric vehicle batteries. The facility will open in the town of Hordain in what is becoming known as France's Battery Valley, as four major battery production facilities are set to open. \"This is a big milestone for Hydrovolt,\" chief executive Ole-Christen Enger said in a statement. \"Entry to the French market will help us maintain our position as a leading European recycler of EV and industrial batteries,\" he added. A joint venture between aluminium giant Norsk Hydro and Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt, Hydrovolt operates Europe's largest recycling used or defective electric car batteries. For electric vehicles to realise their full potential to reduce carbon emissions, recycling the batteries to reuse the valuable minerals they contain is important.Hydrovolt is able to take used batteries and turn them into a powder, or \"black mass\", made up of nickel, manganese, cobalt, lithium and graphite that can be reused to make new batteries. \"Recycling provides a new supply of battery-grade metals which is preferable to freshly mined materials,\" the company said.Hydovolt says it can recover up to 95 percent of the metals from used batteries for reuse. The EU has set recycling targets and the rush towards electric vehicles has created concerns about adequate supplies. The amount of the investment in the French facility was not given.Hydrovolt said the facility, which could open as soon as next year, would at first serve as a collection point to discharge and dismantle batteries but is suitable for recycling operations.\"It is key for us to establish a local presence across Europe to help build a circular battery value chain,\" said Enger. Hydrovolt expects European demand for batteries to grow exponentially as EU nations and Britain move towards electric vehicles.Some 50 major electric battery factories, or \"gigafactories\", have been announced in recent years in Europe as the region strives to avoid becoming fully dependent upon Asian manufacturers in the strategic industry of the future.",

Luxury sports car maker Ferrari on Monday announced two new warranty extension schemes allowing owners of its hybrid models to have the batteries of their vehicles replaced at given times. The move aims to help owners preserve the resale value of their Ferraris as batteries, which tend to lose efficiency over time, become central to the value of electrified cars. As part of its new Warranty Extension Hybrid and Power Hybrid programs Ferrari will replace the high-voltage battery packs (HVB) of the cars covered in their eighth and 16th year of life, the company said in a statement. Ferrari already offers a five-year warranty on their hybrid powertrain parts. The two programs, which will transfer to any subsequent owner, are aimed to \"preserve the performance and excellence\" of hybrid Ferraris over time, the company said. \"In case of future developments in battery technology, the replacement HVB will be a new, state-of-the-art component that will ensure the same performance as the original one,\" it said. The programs, which also offer forms of extended factory warranty on the entire cars and on their major powertrain components, can be purchased in packages renewable for two to four years. They cost around 7,000 euros (USD 7,530) a year, a source close to the matter said, adding they will also apply to Ferrari's new all-electric model due next year. The Italian automaker, famed for its roaring petrol engines, has been selling hybrid-electric cars since 2019, including the SF90 Stradale and the 296 GTB and 296 GTS. It has promised its first, fully electric vehicle at the end of 2025.",

BYD sold 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to Reuters' calculations based on its monthly sales reports. That's around 12,000 vehicles fewer than Tesla's vehicle deliveries estimated for the second quarter. Tesla is expected to report a 6% drop in April-June quarter vehicle deliveries on Tuesday, the first time the U.S. firm is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models. The company may again cede its EV championship to BYD if the actual results turn out to be softer than estimated, with Barclays predicting an 11% drop in second-quarter deliveries, Tesla's biggest ever. Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be \"notably lower\" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes. The EV maker has cut output of its best-selling Model Y electric car by a double-digit percentage number at its Shanghai plant since March to address weakening demand for its aged models in China, its second-largest market after the United States, Reuters reported in May. By comparison, its top Chinese competitor BYD maintained steady growth in EV sales, while EV upstarts such as Nio reported stellar growth last quarter. NIO's vehicle deliveries in the second quarter more than doubled to 57,300 units. Price cuts and a growing shift in consumer demand to EVs and hybrids from gasoline-powered vehicles are the main reasons behind Chinese EV makers' strong sales in recent months, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general, China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). Sales of new energy vehicles including EVs and plug-in hybrids in China made up 46.7% of total car sales in May, a fresh monthly high, as per CPCA data.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's peak power demand is projected to surpass 400 gigawatts (GW) by the 2031-32 period, exceeding the earlier forecast of 384 GW, said Power secretary Pankaj Agarwal on Tuesday.This estimation comes at a time when India has already witnessed a peak demand of 250 GW as of May 30.Speaking at the sidelines of the CII-Smart Metering Conference, Agarwal highlighted the rapid increase in power demand observed in several states over the past two years, suggesting that the initial projection of 384 GW might be an underestimate.\"The peak demand of 250 GW which we met this year is estimated to reach 384 GW by 2031-32. Given the current trends, this estimate might be easily surpassed,\" he added.To support the anticipated demand, India would require a total installed capacity of 900 GW by 2031-32. This need for increased capacity comes as the power demand exhibited a decline following the onset of the monsoon, with the demand dropping to 206 GW on Monday, from a projected peak of 260 GW expected to be reached by September this year.In support of these projections, recent trends within the Indian power sector underscore the necessity for increased capacity. The government has set a formidable goal of achieving 500 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, including substantial contributions from solar and wind energy. This ambitious target is driven by a series of policy measures aimed at promoting renewable energy and enhancing energy efficiency across the nation.Furthermore, as of May, the country's total installed power generation capacity stood at 444.7 GW comprising 242.9 GW of cumulative thermal capacity, 193.6 GW of renewables, and 8.1 GW of nuclear capacity, emphasizing a robust shift towards non-fossil fuel sources. This transition is supported by substantial foreign direct investments, reaching US$ 18.17 billion in the power sector up to December 2023, fostering growth and innovation within the sector.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: Germany's power sector is relying on cuts made to fossil fuel use for the lion's share of recent decarbonisation efforts, but will need a sustained jump in clean generation to ensure a lasting shift in power production away from polluting fuels. German power generators cut fossil fuel-powered output by 19 per cent through the opening half of 2024 from the same months in 2023, data from LSEG shows. That compares to just a 2.1 per cent rise in clean power generation from the first half of 2023, and indicates that power firms are mainly relying on cuts to fossil fuel use to make progress against energy transition aims. Those cuts to fossil fuel use have helped slash German power sector emissions, which totalled 70 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) for the first 5 months of 2024 compared to 88 million tons during January to May of 2023, data from think tank Ember shows. But sluggish industrial activity has meant that overall power demand totals are also down so far this year, which has allowed power suppliers to reduce total generation by more than 6 per cent compared to the first half of 2023. If Germany's manufacturing and industrial activity picks up momentum over the remainder of 2024, total power needs may climb in tow and could put pressure on power suppliers to increase output from fossil fuels to meet that extra demand.  COAL CUTS Coal-fired generation took the brunt of the fossil fuel output cuts, dropping by just over 17 per cent in the first half of 2024 from the same months last year. To make up for lower coal-fired generation, output from natural gas plants increased by 5 per cent in January-June 2024 from the first half of 2023, while generation from oil-fired plants rose 12 per cent and coal-derived gas plants increased output by 3.7 per cent, LSEG data shows. Altogether, total generation from fossil fuels contracted by 19 per cent during the first half of 2024, and follows a 24 per cent contraction in the whole of 2023 from the year before.  CLEAN MAJORITY The drop in fossil fuel generation has resulted in clean power sources securing a majority share of Germany's power generation mix every month since December 2022. The share of clean power in Germany's power generation mix climbed to a new high of 64.6 per cent during the first half of 2024, compared to 59.3 per cent during the same months of 2023 and an average share of 61 per cent for 2023 as a whole. That said, power firms have been unable to offset all the cuts to fossil fuel use with growth from clean energy sources, especially after Germany shut its national nuclear reactor fleet in April 2023. Nuclear reactors had accounted for around 8 per cent of total power generation in 2022, so the complete cessation of such a notable source of clean energy has been hard to replace. Wind farms have emerged as Germany's largest source of clean power, and accounted for an average share of 37 per cent of total power generation last year, according to LSEG. Solar is the second largest source of German clean power, and generated around 17 per cent of all power last year, while hydro assets generated around 4 per cent.  SEASONAL SWINGS During the first half of 2024, wind power generation climbed 7.6 per cent from the same period in 2023, while solar generation rose by 12.8 per cent and hydro output climbed 5.4 per cent. Solar output is liable to climb further during July and August during the height of summer, and could account for around 30 per cent to 35 per cent of total power generation during those months. However, generation from wind farms and hydro dams historically dip during the summer months due to slower wind speeds and reduced water flows from reservoirs. For power producers who need to maintain power supplies around the clock, the drop off in wind and hydro output may set the stage for greater generation from natural gas plants, especially if German manufacturing activity picks up steam. And any such increase in gas-fired output could in turn open the German power sector to accusations of backsliding on power clean-up commitments. To guard against that in the future, power firms will need to substantially increase total generation from clean sources and also substantially raise the storage capacity that can bridge periods of reduced clean generation. The build-out of an entirely clean power generation system may take several more years and continued high levels of annual investment in clean generation and battery construction. Until then, further periods of clean power growth followed by flare ups in fossil-fired output look likely.By Gavin Maguire",

Industry sources have said the low-priced bids from some successful projects indicated that they would be using cheaper Chinese equipment.The EU is toughening its stance against China on green technologies, to attempt to ensure European industries can compete globally and avoid deepening Europe's reliance on Beijing for key building blocks of the clean energy transition.Brussels last month announced tariffs on imported Chinese electric cars, and is investigating Chinese subsidies for wind and solar suppliers.",

The increase comes with coal being used to meet rising demand in both countries, though in the Philippines, coal generation grew by more than the rise in demand.That was because it was also used to meet a drop in production from other sources, including bioenergy and gas, Ember said.Both countries are falling behind their regional counterparts when it comes to wind and solar energy, the group said.Regionally, the two renewables account for an average of 4.4 percent of electricity generation, but just 3.2 percent in the Philippines and 0.3 percent in Indonesia.And while Indonesia generates renewable energy from hydropower, that fell 10 percent last year, possibly because of drought conditions.\"Overall, Indonesia and the Philippines are the two most coal dependent countries in Southeast Asia and their reliance on coal is growing fast,\" the group warned.Last year, Indonesia also became the world's fifth-largest coal power generator, overtaking South Korea for the first time, Ember said.The Philippines aims for renewable energy to make up 35 percent of its power generation by 2030, while Indonesia is committed to reaching 44 percent the same year.The International Energy Agency says that to reach net zero by mid-century, all coal generation that does not capture emissions must end by 2040.",

            "articleBody": "BERLIN: For months, Philip Matthias tried to convince his father to install solar panels on their company's roof in the eastern German state of Thuringia, aiming to cut electricity costs and carbon emissions at the metal products factory. Initially sceptical of the 2.3-million-euro ($2.5 million) investment, a substantial sum for the medium-sized Tridelta, his father crunched the numbers and decided to nearly double the project capacity, opting to install photovoltaic modules that could power around 900 households in addition to the factory. \"The PV systems amortize after about 7-1/2 years. The manufacturer gives a guarantee of 20 years. That means this is an extremely lucrative investment,\" Matthias told Reuters. Since the war in Ukraine and the sudden drop in Russia fossil fuel exports to Germany, Berlin has introduced laws to accelerate solar power expansion, part of its plan to cover 80 per cent of the country's energy from renewables by 2030. Encouraged by a feed-in tariff providing a guaranteed price to renewable energy producers selling their power, as well as reduced solar panel costs, German companies are increasingly turning to solar to get around high energy costs. Although Germany has Europe's biggest capacity of solar and wind power generation, its small and medium-sized companies have yet to benefit from lower electricity prices because of high grid fees and taxes they must pay. By generating their own solar power, they avoid those fees and taxes. Companies consumed around 69 per cent of Germany's national electricity in 2023, data by the BDEW utilities association showed. \"As electricity prices in Germany show no signs of decreasing as previously anticipated, companies are increasingly recognising the economic viability of installing solar panels,\" said Marie-Theres Husken, an energy expert for the BVMW association for small- and medium-sized businesses.  CORPORATE SOLAR SHIFT Newly installed photovoltaic capacity on business rooftops rose by 81 per cent year-on-year in the first four months of the year, outpacing the 1 per cent growth in the residential sector, data by the BSW solar power association shows. A May survey by pollster YouGov showed more than half of German companies with suitable roofs planned to install solar power systems in the next three years. BVMW forecasts that nearly all manufacturing companies in Germany will use solar energy by 2030. In response to increasing demand, Germany's largest residential solar power developer, Enpal, said in April it was expanding into the commercial sector. \"The demand was not as instant... but the growth is going to be very sustainable,\" Melchior Schulze Brock, CEO of commercial and industrial solar startup Enviria. An April study by the Freiburg-based Institute for Applied Ecology showed there was potential to install up to 287 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, more than enough to meet Berlin's 2030 target of 215 GW, along German roads, railways, parking lots, and industrial areas. This could significantly reduce reliance on agricultural land where permitting and planning approvals can take up to a decade. A drop in solar panel prices globally since last year has spurred companies to embrace solar energy. \"The market is overrun with cheap but good panels from China. That means that the system that we are building now is about 20 per cent cheaper than a year ago,\" Matthias said. A German legislative package passed in April easing regulation and increasing subsidies for large rooftop systems as well as a pending tax investment reform for real estate funds operating rooftop solar panels, is expected to drive demand further. State feed-in subsidies for large scale rooftop photovoltaic projects, introduced in 2021 and which are selected via tender, have also boosted the trend. The last tender for the subsidised projects in February saw a 107 per cent rise in the number of offers year-on-year, data by the federal grid network agency showed. A feed-in tariff of 9.3 euros cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than Tridelta's power purchasing price, makes it currently cheaper for the company to sell future generated electricity to the grid and buy it back, Matthias said. Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on companies' electricity trading strategies. \"There's a high correlation between the feed-in tariffs and the build-up of solar PV roof top projects,\" Hugo Willink, Executive Director at solar roofs developer Sunrock told Reuters. Sunrock, which won an order from Mercedes Benz in May to build a 23-megawatt solar project on the carmaker's factory roofs, sees Germany as its core market for the coming year.",

India, which tops the buyers list of seaborne Russian oil cargoes since 2022, purchased more than 65% of Urals loading last month, according to Reuters calculations based on LSEG data. India also imports Russian oil grades other than Urals. The main Indian ports for Urals oil cargoes were Sikka, Vadinar, Mundra and Cochin, according to LSEG data. The ports accommodate oil imports for the main Indian oil refiners: Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy, Indian oil and BPCL. Turkey, which ramped up Urals oil purchases in May to an all-time record, imported slightly less in June, accounting for about 20% of Urals oil exports last month, Reuters calculations based on LSEG data showed. Urals oil cargoes are mostly destined for Turkey's Aliaga and Izmir, where Turkey's Tupras refineries and SOCAR's STAR refineries are situated. June-loading Urals oil deliveries to China were seen as minor, with just a couple of Urals cargoes going there, LSEG data showed. Urals oil supplies to China are low amid weak demand from local refineries, which suffer from weak margins and are not keen to pay up for the Russian grade, traders said. They also added costly freight from Russian western ports to China, also weighing on profitability of supplies, traders said. China remains a major buyer of Russia's Far East ESPO Blend oil grade and has recently increased buying of July-loading cargoes. About 15% of Urals oil cargoes loaded in June don't have a final destination, according to LSEG data. Most of them are likely to find home in India, traders said. India's demand for Russian Urals oil remains high, keeping prices in India's ports at a firm level.",

            "articleBody": "U.S-based short-seller Hindenburg Research said on Monday that India's securities regulator had sent it a letter outlining suspected violations over its short bet against Adani Group last year and revealed it may \"barely come out above breakeven\" on its trade.  Hindenburg also said Kotak Bank, an Indian firm, created and oversaw an offshore fund structure that was used by its \"investor partner\" to bet against the conglomerate, providing new details of trades that have puzzled investors. The short-seller said it made $4.1 million in gross revenue through \"gains related to Adani shorts from that investor relationship\" and just $31,000 through its short position of Adani's U.S. bonds. It did not name the investor. Characterizing the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) \"show cause\" notice as attempted intimidation, Hindenburg wrote that the regulator had made the \"nebulous allegation\" that Hindenburg's report contained misrepresentations and inaccurate statements meant to mislead readers. \"In our view, SEBI has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimized by it,\" Hindenburg said. SEBI, Adani Enterprises and Kotak did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside working hours.  SEBI has also been probing Adani, but India's top court has given it till August 14 to complete its investigation.  The disclosure of the SEBI notice adds a new twist in the saga unleashed last year when Hindenburg, founded by Nathan Anderson, alleged improper business dealings by Adani. The group, which refuted the allegations, suffered a loss of as much as $150 billion in combined market value after the report, but has since rebounded. Hindenburg's response also sheds some new light on the mechanics of its trade, the details of which had intrigued other investors because Indian securities rules make it hard for foreigners bet against companies there. \"It was a tiny position,\" it said. \"But, to date, our research on Adani is by far the work we are most proud of.\"",

            "articleBody": "London: A proposed strike next week at Tata Steel UK's sprawling Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales has been called off, unions said Monday, citing a resumption of talks with management. The Indian-owned giant plans to start shutting the first furnace at the UK's biggest steelworks soon and the second by the end of 2024 under the overhaul, as it transitions to greener production. The Unite trade union had announced in response that Tata staff would begin an indefinite strike from July 8 in protest over the job-slashing plans -- but this has now been suspended. Britain's main opposition Labour party, widely expected to beat the governing Conservatives in a general election on July 4, had urged Tata to avert the strike. \"Unite... has today confirmed that its current industrial action at Tata in South Wales has been paused,\" the union said in a statement on Monday. \"The decision follows confirmation from Tata, arising from high-level talks throughout the weekend, that it was now prepared to enter into negotiations about future investment for its operations and not just redundancies, in South Wales, including at Port Talbot.\" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham hailed a \"breakthrough\" over the matter. \"This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site.\"This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. \"Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste.\"The ovens, which had initially been planned to shutter from July, are used to turn coal into coke, a key raw material used in the steel-making process.Tata had revealed in January that it was planning to shut the coke ovens and two high-emission blast furnaces in Port Talbot, leading to the loss of up to 2,800 jobs.The overhaul comes with the European steel industry facing upheaval as it tries to finance less carbon-intensive production.Tata is seeking to invest &pound;1.25 billion ($1.58 billion), including &pound;500 million in UK government cash, into electric arc furnace technology to try to cut long-term carbon emissions.The company said it would not now bring forward plans to shut one of furnaces early because of the walk-out threat, and would revert to its initial plan for discussions with unions on \"future investments and aspirations for the business\".",

            "articleBody": "After the success of Pavagada Solar park in Tumakuru, the Karnataka government is planning to establish yet another solar park in the district, this time in Madhugiri taluk. The initiative was announced by Energy Minister K J George in Tumakuru. \"The upcoming project will not only scale up Karnataka's clean energy infrastructure, but also holds the potential to significantly enhance environmental stewardship and energy security in the state,\" he said. Madhugiri Solar Park will be developed in a strategic partnership with Tehri Hydro Development Corporation India Limited (THDCIL), owned by the central government. \"This partnership aims to leverage local expertise and resources to identify suitable land parcels essential for advancing Karnataka's renewable energy agenda, instilling confidence in the project's success,\" added George. The energy minister was visiting Tumakuru to review the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM KUSUM) project at the district commissioner's office. \"The subsidy for free electricity for farmers' pump sets is increasing annually. Despite efforts to regularise farmers' pump sets, the issue persists, leading to transformer damage and power supply disruptions due to illegal connections. In this context, we are prioritising the KUSUSM B and Kusum C projects, encouraging the adoption of solar pump sets,\" George added. Outlining the details of the Kusum C project, the minister said, \"To generate 1 MW of electricity under the Kusum C project, 4-5 acres of land are needed. If government land is used, it will be provided free of cost and leased for 25 years. Lessees will pay Rs. 25,000 per acre annually during the lease period. These funds will be deposited in the district collector's account and allocated to develop local anganwadis, schools, and panchayats.\" The PM KUSUM initiative, a joint effort of the central and the state governments, was launched to address farmers' energy needs and make agriculture more sustainable. Accelerating transformative energy security for Indian agriculture involves implementing comprehensive strategies to ensure reliable and sustainable energy sources for farmers, said Gaurav Gupta, additional chief secretary, energy department of Karnataka, during the review meeting. \"We will select land around substations for this initiative. So far, 27 substations have been chosen, with an additional 12 substations to be selected in the next phase for Tumakuru district. Work has already begun in some substations, and surveys have been conducted. The aim is to benefit farmers with locally generated electricity,\" added Gupta. The meeting was also attended by state Home Minister G Parameshwar, who is also the district in-charge minister, cooperation minister K N Rajanna, state government special representative in Delhi T B Jayachandra, MLA K Shadakshari, BESCOM managing director Mahantesh Bilagi and Tumakuru district collector Shubha Kalyan.",

According to the agreement signed in New Delhi, SGEL will provide around 4,500 MW of carbon-free energy from solar and wind sources to support AM Green&rsquo;s upcoming green ammonia facilities.This renewable energy will be integrated with pumped hydro storage by AM Green to ensure consistent power supply to its facilities. The agreement was formalized in the presence of senior officials including Sh. Akhileshwar Singh, Director of Finance at SJVN Ltd, and Sh. Ajay Kumar Singh, CEO of SGEL, among others.Under the phased project plan, SGEL aims to deliver the first 1,500 MW within two years, contributing to SJVN's broader goal to expand its renewable energy capacity to 25,000 MW by 2030 and 50,000 MW by 2040.AM Green, backed by the founders of Greenko Group, targets producing 5 million tonne per annum of green ammonia by 2030. This production capacity is poised to fulfill about one-fifth of India&rsquo;s target under the National Green Hydrogen Mission and 10 percent of Europe&rsquo;s target for green hydrogen imports by 2030.Mahesh Kolli, Founder, Greenko Group &amp; AM Green, commented on the deal, \"We are delighted to partner with SJVN on one of the world&rsquo;s largest carbon-free, renewable energy supply contracts. This partnership demonstrates AM Green&rsquo;s emerging leadership position as a global clean energy transition solutions platform while contributing to India&rsquo;s ambition of emerging as an exporter of reliable, sustainable and lowest-cost green molecules and its derivatives accelerating industrial decarbonisation globally.\"Ajay Singh, CEO, SJVN Green, said, \"We are elated to embark on this collaboration with AM Green, as it holds tremendous potential for accelerating the development of renewable assets in India. The project also marks SJVN&rsquo;s foray into supplying power to private sector entities. With our ambitious capacity addition targets, SJVN is actively pursuing opportunities across the spectrum and is keen to take forward this arrangement with AM Green.\"Additionally, AM Green has recently secured several strategic partnerships and investments, notably with Gentari Sdn Bhd and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, to bolster its position in the global green ammonia market. The company is on the brink of making a final investment decision for its first 2 MTPA green ammonia project early this year, advancing its competitive stance both in India and internationally.",

In anticipation of the monsoon, which typically impacts coal production, the coal ministry has proactively secured a stock of 98.67 million tonnes at the pithead of mines, including coal in transit as of 30th June 2024. This figure is 33.5% higher than last year's stock during the same period.Currently, the coal stock at TPPs fulfills 68% of the normative requirement, a significant increase from 50% around the same time last year. During the fiscal year 23-24, there was no reported scarcity of coal at these plants, with the stock at the end of March 2024 standing over 47 million tonne. The ministry aims to maintain a similar level of stock this fiscal year both at TPPs and at mine pitheads.Additionally, the increase in the number of rakes/days by 10.54% over last year ensures that adequate supplies will be maintained throughout the monsoon season. The ministries of coal, railways, and power are closely coordinating to ensure consistent coal availability for all domestic coal-based TPPs.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a significant move towards sustainable infrastructure development, Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Member (Science) of Niti Aayog, released new guidelines for the utilization of steel slag in road construction. This announcement was made at the First International Conference on Steel Slag Road, jointly organized by CSIR-CRRI and PHDCCI in New Delhi.The guidelines advocate for the processed use of steel slag aggregates in road construction, tapping into the waste from steel industries to foster environmental sustainability. According to Dr. Saraswat, the implementation of these guidelines is expected to yield substantial benefits, including cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced performance of roads.Highlighting the critical role of this initiative, Dr. Saraswat said, \"Adopting these guidelines for construction and maintenance of road network using steel slag is expected to bring numerous benefits, including cost saving, reduced environmental impact, and improved road performance.\" He linked the initiative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s \"Waste to Wealth\" vision, noting significant contributions by Dr. Manoranjan Parida, Director of CRRI, and Shri Satish Pandey, Principal Scientist.Shri Nagendra Nath Sinha, Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Steel, emphasized the research and development efforts leading to these guidelines. He noted, \"The Ministry of Steel sponsored a major R&amp;D project to CSIR-Central Road Research Institute to facilitate large-scale utilization of steel slag as a substitute for natural aggregates in road construction.\"The guidelines also detail a framework for the safe handling and storage of steel slag to prevent environmental contamination, reflecting a comprehensive approach to sustainable construction practices.Dr. N. Kalaiselvi, Secretary, DSIR and DG, CSIR, also supported the initiative, mentioning the Steel Slag Road between Mumbai and Goa as a landmark project underlining the efficacy and potential of this technology.The conference also saw participation from industry leaders who discussed the broader applications and environmental benefits of using steel slag in road construction. Mr. Ranjan Dhar of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India highlighted the success of India&rsquo;s First Steel Slag Road at Hazira, Surat, which used 100 thousand tonnes of processed steel slag and has received national and international recognition for its innovative approach.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd can add up to USD 100 billion to its market capitalisation in its fourth monetisation cycle this century as new cash flow streams emerge and valuation multiples catch up, Morgan Stanley said in a report. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate has seen monetisation cycles deliver 2-3x value creation for shareholders in the past nearly three decades, with each decade seeing USD 60 billion+ in market cap creation.  RIL is in its fourth monetisation cycle this century.  \"Monetisation 4.0 is different; it is supported by the business upcycle, domestic demand, and lower competition,\" the brokerage said. \"RIL's fourth monetisation cycle (since 1997) should add up to USD 100 billion to USD 60 billion increase in market cap year-to-date.\"  Key to this has been RIL's market share gains, complete integration, and most importantly, ability to execute above investor expectations each time the company has re-imagined its business.  This monetisation follows the USD 60 billion in investments in 2021-23, which was the shortest investment cycle since the 1990s for RIL.  Investments made in new energy, retail expansion to take market share from the unorganised sector, and repurposing existing energy businesses provide a long runway to deliver earnings growth consistently even beyond the next three years should ROCE be sustained above 10 per cent.  Morgan Stanley expected the company's earnings to grow at 12 per cent CAGR over FY24-26 with tailwinds in earnings from all verticals.  \"We see RIL's ROE being higher than the cost of capital going forward as it is transitioning to a more profitable, sustainable, and less cyclical growth model due to changes in business as well as capital structure,\" it said.  It raised its multiples (in SOTP) by 0.5-1.0x to reflect this monetisation as RIL catches up with domestic and global peers that have seen the business upcycle and monetisation re-rate multiples by 30 per cent in the past year.  On what has changed and what is priced in, the brokerage said, \"We reflect recent telecom tariff hikes, oil prices, and refining margins, and raise our EPS estimates fractionally for 2025, by 7 per cent for 2026, and by 8 per cent for 2027.\"  \"RIL has been a 'show me' story for the past decade and has seen significant market cap inflection once new revenue streams such as new energy, higher telecom tariffs/chemical margins have been delivered,\" it added.",

(Corporate Affairs &amp; Governance) at Toyota Kirloskar Motor, discussed the economic potential tied to the EV market. \"By 2037, we are set to be a $35 trillion economy if we keep growing at 7%. This growth will significantly increase the demand for transportation and mobility, with energy requirements for vehicles expected to quadruple by 2030,\" he explained.The event also witnessed the participation of international figures such as HE Mr Philip Green OAM, Australia&rsquo;s High Commissioner to India, who emphasized the green energy sector's role in strengthening the bilateral ties between Australia and India. \"We are delighted to have a strong Australian delegation here, possibly the largest foreign contingent at this conference, which underscores our commitment to this sector,\" Green said.The event, which runs until July 5, 2024, will also include various sessions and discussions aimed at advancing India's adoption of cleaner technologies and showcasing innovations in the international battery and energy storage sectors.",

The company's production increased by 13.8 million tonnes compared to the corresponding quarter of FY'24, with all seven producing subsidiaries registering positive growth, it said. CIL's supplies also rose by 6 per cent to 198.4 million tonnes during April-June 2024, with a significant increase in supplies to both power and non-power sectors, it added. The company's coal loading witnessed healthy growth, with an average of 367.2 rakes per day, a 10.3 per cent year-on-year increase, it said. Higher production and loading resulted in a substantial increase in coal inventory at CIL's pitheads, reaching 81.5 million tonnes, providing a sufficient buffer to meet any sudden surge in demand, it said. At a time when power demand in the country is surging, the miner stepped up its supplies to coal-fired plants, registering a 4 per cent growth to 160 million tonnes in Q1 FY'25, a year-on-year increase of 6 million tonnes. In the same period of FY 2024, CIL's off-take to thermal power plants stood at 154 million tonnes, the company said. Additionally, CIL's supplies to the non-power sector reached an all-time high of 38.4 million tonnes in Q1FY25, logging a 16 per cent growth. This sector had received 33 million tonnes in April-June 2023. The growth in June 2024 alone was 23 per cent at 13.4 million tonnes, the statement said.",

            "articleBody": "MOSCOW: Saudi Arabia's state oil producer Aramco left unchanged official selling prices (OSPs) for liquefied petroleum gas in July, while Algeria's Sonatrach raised OSPs for LPG by 11-18 per cent due to a rising demand from the Mediterranean region, traders said. Aramco's July OSP for propane was stable at $580 per metric ton , as well as for butane, at $565 per ton . Propane and butane are types of LPG with different boiling points. LPG is mainly used as a fuel for cars, heating and as a feedstock for other petrochemicals. Sonatrach raised its July OSP for propane by $55 per ton to $550 and increased it for butane by $75 per ton to $500 . Aramco's OSPs for LPG are used as a reference for contracts to supply the product from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region. Sonatrach's OSPs for LPG are used as benchmarks for the Mediterranean, Black Sea region and Turkey. ",

The gain from 52% in the same period last year lifted the coverage to a record high for a six-month period, the research centre said in a statement. Germany's electricity imports rose 21% during the period, while exports fell by 15.5%, it added. The new record in renewable energy use was driven in part by solar panels, which generated 12.8% more energy, accounting for 14.7% of gross electricity generation. That was after a record high in solar panel installations last year, the centre said. The data was calculated under European Union requirements that base the share on usage rather than on production, a method also adopted by the Berlin government for its climate target definitions, BDEW said.

            "articleBody": "Islamabad: Weeks after slashing the prices of fuel ahead of the Eid ul Adha festival, the cash-strapped Pakistan government on Monday sharply hiked their prices for the next fortnight as it began the new fiscal year. According to a notification, the prices of petrol and High-Speed Diesel (HSD) were raised by Rs 7.45 and Rs 9.56 per litre respectively on the first day of a tax-laden budget for 2024-25, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.  Last month, the government slashed the prices of petrol and HSD by Pakistani Rs 10.20 and Pakistani Rs 2.33 per litre respectively, ahead of Eid ul Adha.  The Ministry of Finance in a late-night announcement said the prices of petroleum products have seen an increasing trend in the international market during the last fortnight, the Dawn newspaper reported.  The increase in petroleum product prices has been made based on the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority's (Ogra) recommendations and with the prime minister's approval, The Express Tribune said.  The new ex-depot petrol price for July 1 to 15 would be Pakistani Rs 265.61 per litre compared to Rs 258.16 in the previous fortnight, up by 2.9 per cent, the Dawn reported.  However, petrol would be available for over Pakistani Rs 266 per litre in the retail market, it said.  On the other hand, the new ex-depot price of HSD is Pakistani Rs 277.45 per litre, or 3.6 per cent higher than the Pakistani Rs 267.89 over the past fortnight.  Hours before the price hike announcement, Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced on Sunday evening that the petroleum levy would not be increased. Although its ceiling had been increased to Pakistani Rs 70 per litre in the budget from Pakistani Rs 60 to create \"headroom\" for the future, the Dawn reported.  Officials said the prices of petrol and HSD had increased in the international market by about USD 4.4 and USD 5.5 per barrel, respectively, in the last fortnight, the report said.  Since May 1, the prices of both petrol and HSD have been going down mainly because of a slump in the international market. Petrol prices dropped by nearly Pakistani Rs 35 to about Pakistani Rs 259 per litre on April 30. Likewise, the HSD price came down by about Pakistani Rs 22 to Pakistani Rs 268 per litre in the second fortnight of April.  Finance Minister Aurangzeb on Sunday conceded that the people were stressed due to new taxes imposed in the budget after his revenue measures were criticised by almost everyone.  His comments came as President Asif Ali Zardari accorded his approval to tax-laden Finance Bill 2024 on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The bill would be effective from July 1, according to the press release by the President Secretariat.  Addressing a press conference, Aurangzeb said he understood that the salaried class was particularly experiencing financial strain from new taxes. He pledged to offer relief to salaried individuals once any financial respite becomes feasible.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India and Australia are looking at ways to increase cooperation in critical minerals and their processing besides battery production, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said on Monday. Both countries have signed an interim free trade agreement and are in negotiations to expand that into a comprehensive pact, he said.  \"We are looking at how we can integrate our (India and Australia) economies in terms of battery production, in terms of mineral production, in terms of mineral processing, in terms of vehicle production,\" the secretary said here at a conference on the roadmap for vehicle electrification.  He also said that the government has taken a series of steps to promote domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and strengthened the ecosystem around that like boosting charging infrastructure.  Speaking at the event, Australian High Commissioner to India Philip Green OAM said they have huge mineral and energy resources that can support 'make in India'.  Australia has strong reserves of critical minerals and is the largest producer of lithium and the second largest producer of cobalt in the world.  \"We want to make India able to get easier access to all of the critical minerals and other capabilities in our society that can help India's green transition, and the only way we can achieve that is by a full free trade agreement,\" he said.  Critical minerals such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements are essential components in many of today's rapidly growing clean energy technologies - from wind turbines and electricity networks to electric vehicles.  Demand for these minerals is growing quickly with clean energy transitions gathering pace.  Barthwal added that like Australia, India has signed a trade pact with the four-nation European bloc EFTA and Norway is a key member of that grouping.  \"Norway has done extremely well in terms of the renewable energy sector...and we are collaborating with Norway. Similarly, we are collaborating with the European Union.  \"We have a technology group where we are looking at different technologies in battery making, in vehicle making, in mineral processing, in critical technologies,\" he said, adding, this is the time when each and everyone in the globe has to join hands together because this energy transition requirements and the commitment to reduce carbon emissions is for everybody.  Talking about huge opportunities in the EV sector in India, Barthwal said that the sale of EVs is increasing at a faster pace in the country and that requires a whole ecosystem not only EV manufacturing, but also battery making and charging ecosystem.  \"A whole gamut of activities is going to open up through the energy transition in the country and there is a lot to do both by the government and the private sector and therefore great opportunity is coming to investors to invest in this whole value chain,\" the secretary said.  The government, he said, is focusing on the whole chain, including the production of minerals.  The mines ministry is looking at resources in India as well as in the global supply chain.  \"We understand that this is a sector which is upcoming, and there are disabilities and constraints and therefore we are looking at how to provide a system of a level playing field, a system of incentives so that the sector grows in India,\" Barthwal said.  At present, around 1.7 million EVs have been sold in the country.  The government has rolled out schemes like Faster Adoption &amp; Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) and production linked incentive scheme for the sector.  \"We are looking at the whole gamut of value chain so that disabilities of manufacturers can be removed,\" he said.  The Centre, he said, is also talking with states to promote ease of doing business for the sector and on land availability for production and manufacturing.  \"We are trying to create an ecosystem whereby investments can be encouraged...close to USD 500 billion of potential exists. So I think it's a huge opportunity,\" he added.",

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: China's latest monthly power report excluded data on usage rates by generation source, after recent data showed declining utilisation at renewable power plants, a trend that was expected to continue. In a monthly data release on Friday, China's energy administration published only the average operating hours of all types of power plants for January to May. Previous data releases had broken down the statistics by generation source, including hydro, thermal, nuclear, wind, and solar generation. Usage rates for wind and solar had been expected to drop further after the government relaxed rules on renewable power utilisation in May. The report did not give a reason for the change and China's energy administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The previous month's data release - which captured January-April and was the last to include the detailed statistics - showed that solar and wind plant utilisation fell while hydro and thermal plant utilisation increased. In the first four months of the year, the average operating hours of wind and solar power plants dropped by 77 hours and 42 hours to 789 and 373 hours, respectively. Hydro plant operating hours rose by 48 hours to 783 hours on average and thermal power plants rose by 23 hours to 1,448 hours, respectively. China's cabinet said in a CO2 action plan on May 29 that it would increase the limit on renewable power curtailment from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, while also accelerating plans to build ultra-high voltage transmission lines. Curtailment is when grid managers stop a certain amount of supply coming onto the grid to maintain balances with demand. The previous limit of 5 per cent was in line with rates of 1.5-4 per cent in most big markets, according to the International Energy Agency. The change is expected to allow more renewable capacity to be built, but at lower utilisation rates. Average utilisation hours of all power generators surveyed were 1,372 during the first five months of the year, 59 hours lower than in the same period of 2023, according to the energy bureau data on Friday. Last August, China suspended the release of youth unemployment data, which had hit record highs, before resuming the reports in January with a new methodology that excludes students.",

This trend is followed by electric three-wheelers and small trucks, with electric cars projected to capture about 10 per cent of the total market, influenced by evolving charging infrastructure and consumer price sensitivity.In terms of sales volume, Tata Motors led the market in 2023, selling 53,199 units. It was followed by SAIC with 12,562 units and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra with 8,286 units. Popular models included the Tata Nexon BEV, Tata Tigor/Tiago BEV, and the Mahindra XUV400 BEV.Despite the current growth, the development of charging infrastructure remains a challenge, with the pace described as slow but expected to accelerate to meet increasing demand. The report highlights that global manufacturers like Renault-Nissan and Stellantis are investing in Indian production facilities to capitalize on the low-cost manufacturing environment for potential exports.Government initiatives have significantly contributed to the market's growth, with schemes like Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) and various state-level incentives supporting the transition to electric mobility. The Indian government's ambitious targets aim for electric vehicles to comprise 30 per cent of private car sales, 70 per cent of commercial vehicle sales, and 80 per cent of two- and three-wheeler sales by 2030.Challenges such as the high cost of acquisition and the need for longer-range EV models continue to impede faster adoption rates. However, the government's focus on reducing import dependence through localized manufacturing and policy support for technologies like battery swapping is expected to mitigate these barriers.The report underscores the promising future of the Indian EV market, driven by robust government support, advancing technology, and a growing consumer base eager for sustainable transportation solutions.",

            "articleBody": "MOSCOW: Top Russian oil producer Rosneft has appointed a new head of Vostok Oil, a flagship project where Russia expects to produce and export as much as 2 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030. Rosneft named Andrei Lazeyev, former boss of Rosneft firm Bashneft, to lead Vostok Oil, data from the state registry showed. He will replace Vladimir Chernov as they swap places. Chernov was appointed to lead Bashneft last month. The change in management is aimed at spurring faster development at the oilfields, the Kommersant newspaper reported last month. Lazeyev, who worked at Russo-British oil producer TNK-BP, moved to Rosneft as chief geologist in 2013 following its acquisition of TNK-BP. He joined the management board of Rosneft in 2022 and took the reins at Bashneft, the Kommersant reported. Expected output from Vostok Oil if realised would match that of the entire North Sea oil market which is between some 1.8 million and 2 million bpd. It would also be on a par with production realised at the Samotlor West Siberian oilfield in the 1970s and 1980s. Vostok Oil's loading terminal, the Bukhta Sever, in the Yenisei Bay on the Taymyr Peninsula is expected to handle 600,000 bpd when finished this year, or around 15% of Russia's total and equal to current loadings from Primorsk, Russia's largest Baltic sea port.

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: Iron ore futures prices rose on Monday, helped by better-than-expected factory data in top consumer China and hopes of more stimulus measures in the world's second-largest economy later this month. The most-traded September iron ore contract on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) traded 1.2 per cent higher at 829 yuan ($114.06) a metric ton, as of 0304 GMT. The benchmark August iron ore on the Singapore Exchange was nearly 0.6 per cent higher at $107.2 a ton. The Caixin/S&amp;P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.8 in June from 51.7 in the previous month, marking the fastest clip since May 2021 and surpassing analysts' forecasts of 51.2. The official manufacturing PMI was unchanged from May at 49.5 in June, data showed on Sunday, below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and in line with a median forecast of 49.5 in a Reuters poll. The expectation that hot metal output will fall significantly receded after the latest property stimulus in Beijing, analysts at Jinrui Futures said in a note. China's capital city Beijing unveiled last week measures to reduce the cost of buying a home by cutting mortgage interest rates and the minimum down payment ratio. Additionally, some investors and traders are bearing hopes for possibly more stimulus from the long-delayed third plenum to be held from July 15 to July 18. Other steelmaking ingredients on the DCE gained ground, with coking coal and coke up 1.9 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively. Steel benchmarks on the Shanghai Futures Exchange posted marginal gains. Rebar ticked 0.3 per cent higher, hot-rolled coil advanced 0.4 per cent, wire rod edged up 0.1 per cent and stainless steel added 0.5 per cent. \"The room for a further fall in steel prices in the second half of the year is limited as the valuation has already stayed at a relatively low level and many mills are suffering loss,\" Everbright Futures said in a note.",

            "articleBody": "MELBOURNE: Indonesia's Delta Dunia Group plans to grow through acquisitions, backed by strong support from its lenders, after it completed the $122.4 million purchase of Atlantic Carbon Group on Monday, director Iwan Salim said. The Jakarta-listed company has been diversifying beyond its home base of Indonesia where it runs its BUMA coal mining services business. It bought Australia's Downer coal mining contractor business for A$139 million ($92.63 million) in 2021 and has now expanded into US markets and mining anthracite coal, used to make steel. Its latest deal has secured ownership of four producing anthracite mines in Pennsylvania, which will help Delta Dunia to lower its revenue from thermal coal to below 50 per cent of its total revenue by 2028. \"We are going to use this very positive momentum going forward,\" Salim told Reuters. \"We have a lot of support from our bankers if the growth opportunity is correct.\" The activity comes as major financial institutions have shied away from lending to fossil fuel companies given climate change concerns. Salim did not specify acquisition targets, timelines or the spending plans on them. For Delta, the latest transaction and its growth plans are supported by a cash position of $322 million as of end June and a $750 million syndicated loan facility with PT Bank BNI (Persero) Tbk and PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk. It has also received support from several Shariah compliant banks, Indonesian and US bond holders in the past year given Delta Dunia's strong track record for repayments, he said. The diversified mining services provider is looking at Australia, where Anglo American is set to sell its coking coal mines, for growth, as well as at other jurisdictions, Salim said. \"We will look at opportunities as they arise,\" he said. \"Australia, because we're already there with Buma Australia, the contracting business, is something we actively look at.\" \"But with the American acquisition, you can see that our outward radar is not just on Australia.\" The door is not closed on buys into mines producing other metals such as lithium or copper, but for now it plans to focus on what it knows best, which is coal, and mining services, he said.

            "articleBody": "Lubumbashi: In the boiling sun, Mifie and her neighbours work hard to grow vegetables in fields at the edge of a Congolese river which campaigners say has long been polluted by a copper and cobalt mine.\"We cannot live properly with this polluted water,\" the pregnant 23-year-old said among the cabbages, amaranth and other vegetables at her plot in DR Congo's southeastern mining region.Irrigation channels from the Luano river can be seen weaving paths through fields to bring water to feed the crops.  But acidity in the water hampers agricultural production and causes health problems such as skin and eye complaints, villagers say. The Democratic Republic of Congo is Africa's top producer of copper, vital for energy storage, electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines. It is also the world's largest producer of cobalt -- a key component of batteries used in electronics and electric vehicles. For more than 100 years, an abundance of mineral wealth has driven economic activity in the vast country's second biggest city, Lubumbashi.But the mines also produce water, air and ground pollution, NGOs say, demanding tighter regulation of the sector. Lying on the outskirts of the city, the Luano river is the main discharge point for wastewater from the nearby Ruashi mine, three NGOs said in a report in 2021.Environmental charity PremiCongo, Afrewatch, which campaigns for fair use of natural resources, and ACIDH human rights group conducted a study among people living near the large open cast mine operated by Ruashi Mining.Chinese company Jinchuan Group owns a 75-percent share in Ruashi Mining, while Congolese business Gecamines owns the rest.\"The three communities are some of the poorest people in Lubumbashi,\" Christian Bwenda, PremiCongo coordinator, told AFP.- 'Sore eyes' - Crops do not grow in the acidic earth as they used to, say the farmers, who resort to buying fertilisers.Mifie, who declined to give her full name, earns 200,000 Congolese francs ($70) a month.But a packet of fertiliser costs 2,500 Congolese francs (about 90 cents) and sometimes she buys as many as five a day. \"I work a lot to earn a little. I don't have enough income,\" said another farmer Emmie Kasungo, standing with her three daughters in tall stalks of corn. Strawberry farmer Celestin, who also declined to give his full name, does not use fertilisers as customers want organic fruit. \"People prefer to not consume strawberries with polluted water,\" he also said. But standing in knee-high wellington boots, he told AFP that he had suffered skin problems which he blamed on water from the Luano river.\"When I was working without boots, I had some sores. It hurt,\" he said.Teacher Ngoy Therese, 58, says around 60 percent of the children she sees have health issues related to the water in the area and dust from the mine.\"We have people with sore eyes,\" she told AFP.Local activist Christophe Kabwita pointed to marks on his skin which he believes come from mining pollution. Around the mine \"new illness\" has appeared that was not there before, he said.- 'Avoid the water' - Lubumbashi University professor Arthur Kaniki, who also helps run its environmental analysis laboratory, has carried out studies of rivers near mining sites in Upper Katanga province where Lubumbashi is the main city. He said water near many mines often shows a \"state of pollution\" and, in some rivers, an \"elevated concentration\" of copper and cobalt. Pollution from the \"presence of solid matter\" is \"generated from mining\", he said.\"This risks contaminating the food chain, it's an enormous risk for the health of the population,\" Kaniki told AFP. \"We have asked the population to avoid using this water, especially for direct consumption or for watering (plants).\"Sediment collected from the village of Luano shows that the water is acidic, while tests of the Luano river show the same, the 2021 study said. \"The problem of pollution always exists where there are areas of mines,\" Georges Mawine, former mines minister for Upper Katanga, told AFP.In response to AFP requests for comment, Ruashi Mining said it conducted environmental monitoring but gave no information on the results.\"We have an environmental department that regularly takes water and air samples,\" Elisa Kalasa, social and community head of department for Ruashi Mining, told AFP in an email.\"Ruashi Mining has improved water for the community in partnership with (water company) Regideso,\" she added, without giving details.But for Bwenda, the solution is simple.\"The company must take all measures possible so that the negative impacts on the life of people are reduced as much as possible,\" he said.",

            "articleBody": "SINGAPORE: China is setting up a new entity that groups national oil producers and other state firms to search for ultra-deep oil and gas reserves and tackle harder-to-extract non-conventional resources, state energy group CNPC said on Monday. This is in answer to President Xi Jinping's call for the sector to have \"new productive forces\" that will contribute to the country's energy security, CNPC said on its website. In addition to CNPC and Sinopec, the country's two dominant producers of oil and gas, the new body gathers seven other state groups including China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, steel group Baowu, equipment builder Sinomach, Dongfang Electric Group and Minmetals. \"This...is to gather wisdom and strength to jointly build an industry chain from ultra-deep oil and gas exploration to development to engineering,\" CNPC said. The group will drill conventional resources at ultra-deep wells that extend as much as 10,000 meters (6.21 miles) below the surface in places like northwest Xinjiang's Tarim basin region where CNPC and Sinopec are major players. It will also seek to tap deep shale oil and coal-seam gas resources. China is the world's largest crude oil importer and relies on imports for nearly three-quarters of its needs. It has been investing billions of dollars to maintain its domestic crude oil production at above 4 million barrels a day, a level seen as necessary to power manufacturing activities and military services. Years of effort by state oil majors to drill deeper onshore and accelerate development at offshore oilfields have yielded output growth of 2 per cent per year since 2018. That said, state firms have to contend with declining output at large mature fields. They are also grappling with the geological and cost challenges of extracting shale oil and gas resources.",

            "articleBody": "In South Korea, Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp.&rsquo;s moves toward electrification are provoking similar anxieties in that country&rsquo;s highly active and organized labor movement.The threat to jobs caused by the electric vehicle transition isn&rsquo;t just a hot-button issue in the US, where a presidential election campaign is in full swing.In Japan, the heads of Toyota Motor Corp., the country&rsquo;s largest employer with close to 381,000 staff, are grappling with how the carmaker&rsquo;s technological transformation will impact not only its workers but the nation&rsquo;s vast auto supply chain and the thousands of jobs it supports.In South Korea, Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp.&rsquo;s moves toward electrification are provoking similar anxieties in that country&rsquo;s highly active and organized labor movement. Hyperdrive sat down in Seoul last week with officials from the Korean Metal Workers&rsquo; Union, which represents roughly 180,000 auto workers, including about 70,000 at Hyundai and Kia, the country&rsquo;s two dominant manufacturers. The union, formed in 2001, is in the process of negotiating a new annual contract for Hyundai&rsquo;s vehicle assembly workers and it&rsquo;s threatened to strike over disagreements on future hiring plans and sharing the spoils of Hyundai&rsquo;s record profits in 2023.The conflict has clear echoes of the contentious six-week strike between the United Auto Workers union and the Detroit Three carmakers last fall.Last week was also the week that at least 23 people, mostly migrant workers from China, died in a fire caused by explosions at a lithium battery plant south of Seoul. The fire, at a factory owned by Aricell, which makes products for industrial and military applications, was the worst accident at a battery plant in the country&rsquo;s history. In response, the government has formed a task force to improve fire safety measures across the industry.We asked union officials including policy secretary Kim Sang Min and executive director of international, Hyewon Chong, how they&rsquo;re dealing with challenges like job losses due to electrification and automation, as well as safety risks as EV battery production expands. The conversation, which was both in Korean and English, has been edited for length and clarity.We have to overhaul safety management systems in light of the incredible risks. If a company is going to bring in temporary, outsourced workers, they have to have a safety management system in place for these people. Aricell is a subsidiary of S-Connect and there was an outsourced recruitment firm for the factory workers. This kind of system hinders workers from connecting with each other and helps employers control them more easily. We&rsquo;re trying to respond to this trend. Hyundai is pushing electrification, building EV plants in South Korea and the US, and a new heavily automated facility in Singapore. What does this mean for your members?The visit to Hyundai&rsquo;s plant in Singapore made us realize that it will be hard to keep our jobs. So we&rsquo;re trying to demand that companies create new jobs related to green industries. It&rsquo;s something we really think about deeply and study what kind of demands will really make a difference. We need to confess, we don&rsquo;t have a magic bullet.Dealing with this only at the factory level would be insufficient to address what&rsquo;s going on in society. If we limit our sights to inside the factory walls, it looks like jobs are being reduced. On the other hand, there are also workers who are going to be building robots.So what does that look like in practice?We signed an agreement on industrial transformation with Korean metal industry employers in 2021. This year we&rsquo;re focusing on supply chains, a plan called &ldquo;just transition,&rdquo; where automakers are taking overall responsibility for realizing carbon neutrality in their supply chains.We have to develop clusters and strategies for different regions for different sub-sectors. A consultation framework should be made so that the local community and the companies and the trade unions will be able to find strategies to realign their economic production on something that&rsquo;s needed, something that will continue employment in a sustainable way.South Korea&rsquo;s working population is shrinking as post-war baby boomers retire, and companies are increasingly hiring migrant workers. How do you communicate with this new generation?We publish newsletters in various languages to deliver information they need to know, such as how to calculate Korean base salaries. Removing discrimination against migrant workers is one of our three main issues we plan to negotiate with companies this year. We also try to help them standardize their labor agreements, as migrant workers sometimes need special clauses such as ways to improve their living conditions at accommodations. And is Gen-Z interested in joining the union? In one of your newsletters, a union member said young people these days have &ldquo;a weaker willingness for fighting&rdquo; against management.Gen-Zs and millennials still account for a very small portion of the population at metal workers&rsquo; unions and the average age of unionized workers is rising. So, it&rsquo;s true that the demographic trend makes younger people raise their voices less than older generations do. There are views, which are a bit prejudiced, that younger generations don&rsquo;t have much interest in labor disputes and they tend to focus on their own interests. But we see some newly created unions by younger workers and they are showing actions that we didn&rsquo;t see previously, such as scuffling with gatekeepers at plants. They&rsquo;re trying to do something different from the older generation.",

JSW Group had failed to emerge as the winning bidder in the last tendering round, where Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ) had emerged as the L1 bidder in October 2022, and a Letter of Intent to Award (LOIA) was handed over to the company. However, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's announcement at the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS) in November 2023 that a tender would soon be launched for the development of the port. This has led to a cloud of uncertainty around the mega deep-sea port project.  JSW Infrastructure seals deal; to buy Navkar CorporationJSW Infra has finalized an agreement to purchase all shares held by the promoters of Mumbai's Navkar Corporation, which operates in the container handling sector, according to a disclosure to the stock exchange. Navkar Corporation offers a range of complementary products to the ports owned and managed by the Sajjan Jindal-group company. JSW Infra will pay Rs. 1,013 crore in cash for the stake acquired from Navkar Corporation's promoters.See More DetailsBanerjee had announced that the proposed deep-sea port at Tajpur is ready for tender, which would attract an investment of USD 3 billion or Rs 25,000 crore. JSW Infrastructure Joint Managing Director and CEO Arun Maheswari told PTI: \"We will re-evaluate our strategies. Previously, when we bid, it was 2-3 years back.\" He was in Kolkata to attend a CII Young Indians event. Since the chief minister's announcement, there has been no official word on the next steps, though Adani officials said they were in touch with the state administration. \"There has been no official clarification since the CM's announcement. However, we remain committed to the project and are still waiting for an award,\" Adani group sources said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The Tajpur deep sea port project is a challenging one, and the state government needs to be forthcoming to make the project a reality, sources said.  Udupi Cochin Shipyard Limited bags Rs 1,100 crore order for cargo vessels from Norwegian firmUCSL secured a Rs 1,100 crore deal for eight 6300 TDW cargo vessels from Wilson ASA. These vessels, designed for eco-friendly operation in European coastal waters, are part of a project to be completed by September 2028. The company has also delivered tugs to Adani Harbour Services and received repeat orders from Polestar Maritime.See More DetailsAPSEZ is the country's largest private port operator with an installed capacity of about 550 million tonnes per annum, while JSW Infra is also a major player boasting an installed cargo handling capacity of 170 million tonnes per annum. The proposed port's main features include a location five km from NH-116B and around 170 km from Kolkata. The port will have a deep draft of 12.1m, an 18-km channel, and tidal support of 3.9m, enabling large capesize vessels of one lakh DWT. The project is expected to entail an investment of Rs 15,000 crore, with an additional Rs 10,000 crore for related port-led infrastructure development, totalling Rs 25,000 crore. It is expected to create around 25,000 direct jobs and over one lakh indirect jobs. The Tajpur deep sea port was touted to usher in a new era of growth in the state, extending its benefits to the hinterland areas. As a deep sea greenfield port, its linkage to the Industrial and Economic Corridor from Dunkuni to Raghunathpur, being developed by the state, will enhance regional logistics and export efficiency, unlocking vast industrial and economic opportunities once operational, the state had said in the past.",

Efforts are also underway to increase its production for industrial purposes. Moreover, ongoing research has paved the way for the potential applications of activated carbon in water purification and sensor development, underscoring its vast potential in sustainable energy storage and beyond, the release further said. The successful development of coconut husk-derived activated carbon by the research team marks a significant breakthrough in the field of energy storage, it said. Utilising an advanced microwave pyrolysis reactor, the team was able to produce high-quality carbon in a mere five minutes, eliminating impurities like ash and generating zero waste. The device's high-power output, capable of powering two LEDs for 20 minutes, surpasses existing research by four times, paving the way for commercial energy storage applications, according to the release. This achievement showcases the potential of coconut husk-derived activated carbon to revolutionise the energy storage landscape, enabling sustainable and efficient energy solutions. The team's innovative approach and results have far-reaching implications, positioning this technology at the forefront of the quest for reliable and eco-friendly energy storage solutions. CCIF, funded by the Government of Kerala, is the first of its kind in the state and is equipped with world-class state-of-the-art facilities, including advanced instruments like NMR spectrometer, BET analyzer, fluorimeter, Electrochemical workstation, and PCR machines. With a vision to foster collaborative research and innovation, CCIF provides access to these world-class facilities at a reasonable service charge, ensuring that researchers from diverse institutions can leverage its capabilities. The facility has already catered to the needs of researchers from more than 50 colleges, six universities, and six national institutes, the release added.",

Saudi Arabia is working on developing its unconventional gas reserves, which require advanced extraction methods such as those used in the shale gas industry. Jafurah is the kingdom's largest unconventional non-oil associated gas field and is potentially the biggest shale gas development outside the United States, with reserves reaching 229 trillion cubic feet of gas and 75 billion barrels of condensates. \"By generating an anticipated 2 billion standard cubic feet per day of sales gas by 2030, this bold initiative will strengthen Saudi Arabia's position as one of the top national gas producers in the world\", said Nasser, speaking of the Jafurah field at a contracts award ceremony in Dhahran. The main gas network expansion will add 4,000 more kilometers of pipelines, boosting capacity by around 3.2 billion standard cubic feet per day and connecting several additional cities from across the country to the network, he said. Companies awarded contracts for the expansion in Jafurah included a consortium involving Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, while Chinese state energy giant Sinopec figured among the firms involved in the main gas network expansion.

SK Group also said it plans to secure 80 trillion won by 2026 to invest in artificial intelligence and semiconductors as well as fund shareholder returns, while streamlining its more than 175 subsidiaries. The sprawling conglomerate outlined the plans following a two-day strategy meeting, aiming to revive the group after SK Hynix, its main money maker, and the group's electric vehicle battery arm suffered heavy losses.  SK Group said it sought to improve its competitiveness by focusing on its AI value chain, including high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, AI data centres and AI services such as personalised AI assistants. At a time of transition, a \"preemptive and fundamental change is necessary,\" SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won was quoted as saying in the statement During the meeting, the executives also agreed to take gradual steps to adjust the number of subsidiaries in the group to a \"manageable range\", without specifying the scale of the reduction. Local media had said SK Innovation, which owns the county's largest oil refiner and battery maker SK On, was expected to pursue a merger with profitable gas affiliate SK E&amp;S.  The group expects its profit before tax to reach around 22 trillion won this year, turning around from a loss last year, with the goal of hitting 40 trillion won in profit before tax by 2026. South Korea, home to the world's top memory chip makers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, has fallen behind some rivals in areas such as chip design and contract chip manufacturing. Earlier this year, the government announced a 26 trillion won ($19 billion) support package for its chip businesses, citing a need to keep up in areas like chip design and contract manufacturing amid 'all-out warfare' in the global semiconductor market.",

            "articleBody": "LAUNCESTON: Asia's imports of crude oil ticked lower in the first half of 2024 from the same period last year, defying expectations that the top-consuming continent would lead global demand growth. Asia imported 27.16 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in the January to June period, down a modest 130,000 bpd from the 27.29 million bpd in the same period in 2023, according to data compiled by LSEG Oil Research. The slightly weaker outcome was largely a result of lower arrivals in China, the world's biggest oil importer, with gains by Asia's number two buyer India not enough to offset China's softness. The lack of growth in Asia's imports of crude oil in the first half goes some way to undermining the 2024 demand forecasts from major industry groups such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Of course, imports are only one component of overall demand, others including domestic oil production and changes in inventory levels. But in Asia, imports are the key driver of demand given the region's reliance on oil arriving in tankers, or via pipelines from Russia and central Asia in the case of China. For the demand forecasts made by the IEA and OPEC, it's certain that Asia's imports are going to have to be strong in the second half, especially those for China. OPEC's June monthly oil market report forecast that China's oil demand would grow by 720,000 bpd in 2024 over 2023, while the IEA is expecting an expansion of 500,000 bpd. However, China's imports were about 11.08 million bpd in the first half, a figure calculated by using official customs data for the first five months and LSEG's forecast for June. This is down 300,000 bpd from the customs number of 11.38 million bpd for the first six months of 2023. With China's imports looking weak, it's worth looking at whether domestic output is making up the difference. Domestic production was 4.28 million bpd in the first five months of the year, up 1.8% or about 140,000 bpd from the same period in 2023. In other words, the rise in domestic output is just less than half of the loss in crude oil imports.  INDIA'S DIM LIGHT If there is a somewhat brighter light in Asia, it's India, where crude imports were about 4.94 million bpd in the first half of 2024, according to calculations based on official and LSEG data. This is up about 90,000 bpd from the official figure of 4.85 million bpd for the first half of 2023. However, this relatively small gain in India's imports looks less impressive when the economic growth rate of 7.8% year-on-year in the first quarter is taken into account. It's also running at a rate below the OPEC forecast for India's demand to increase by 230,000 bpd for the whole of 2024, meaning that for the exporter group's estimate to be accurate, a strong second half will be needed. Overall, OPEC is expecting Asia's crude demand to rise by 1.3 million bpd in 2024 from the previous year, consisting of 720,000 bpd for China, 230,000 bpd for India and 350,000 bpd for the rest of the continent. The IEA expects Asia's demand to lift by 900,000 bpd in 2024, made up of 500,000 bpd in China and 400,000 bpd for the rest of the continent. But with imports actually dropping in the first half by 130,000, it leaves a mountain to climb in the second half. The question for the markets is whether there is confidence that China's economy will rebound in the second half, and that the rest of Asia will enjoy stronger economic growth as well. If the assumption is that OPEC and its allies in the broader OPEC+ group are successful in keeping oil prices above $80 a barrel, then it follows that only robust economic growth will lead to higher demand for crude.",

            "articleBody": "Bengaluru: Researchers at the Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, Indian Institute of Science, have developed an enzymatic platform that can efficiently transform naturally abundant and inexpensive fatty acids to valuable hydrocarbons called 1-alkenes, which are promising biofuels. Given the finite availability and polluting nature of fossil fuels, scientists are increasingly exploring sustainable fuel pathways that involve compounds called hydrocarbons. They show great potential as \"drop-in\" biofuels, which can be blended and used with existing fuels and infrastructure, according to Bengaluru-based IISc. These hydrocarbons can potentially be synthesised on a large scale using microorganism \"factories\". Enzymes that help mass-produce these hydrocarbons are therefore highly sought after. Hydrocarbons are also widely used in polymer, detergent and lubricant industries, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) noted in a press release. In a previous study, the IISc team purified and characterised an enzyme called UndB, bound to the membranes of living cells, especially certain bacteria. It can convert fatty acids to 1-alkenes at the fastest rate currently possible. But the team found that the process was not very efficient 'the enzyme would become inactivated after just a few cycles.  When they investigated further, they realised that H2O2 'a byproduct of the reaction process' was inhibiting UndB. In the current study published in \"Science Advances\", the team circumvented this challenge by adding another enzyme called catalase to the reaction mix. \"The catalase degrades the H2O2 that is produced,\" explains Tabish Iqbal, first author of the study and PhD student at IPC. Adding catalase, he says, enhanced the activity of the enzyme 19-fold, from 14 to 265 turnovers (turnover indicates the number of active cycles an enzyme completes before getting inactivated).  Excited by this finding, the team decided to create an artificial fusion protein combining UndB with catalase, by introducing a fused genetic code via carriers called plasmids into E.coli bacteria. Given the right conditions, these E.coli would then act as a \"whole cell biocatalyst\", converting fatty acids and churning out alkenes, the release said. However, there were several challenges. Being a membrane protein, UndB is extremely challenging to work with. Beyond a certain concentration, it can be toxic to bacterial cells. Membrane proteins like UndB are also not soluble in water, making it hard to maintain the right conditions for studying them, it was noted.  To improve the efficiency of their chimeric protein, the team tested the effect of various \"redox partner\" proteins that help shuttle electrons to UndB during the conversion of fatty acids to alkenes. They found that proteins called ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, along with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), were able to supply electrons most efficiently. On incorporating these in the genetically modified E.coli and feeding fatty acids, the efficiency of conversion rose up to 95 per cent. A key advantage of this biocatalyst is that UndB is very specific and does not produce any unwanted side products 'pure 1-alkene is the only product, says Debasis Das, Assistant Professor at IPC and corresponding author. \"1-alkenes can directly be used as biofuels,\" he adds. The team found that their biocatalyst could convert a wide range of fatty acids containing different types of carbon chains to 1-alkene. They also showed that the biocatalyst can produce styrene, an important commodity in chemical and polymer industries. The team has applied for a patent for their engineered protein and whole cell biocatalyst. They are also looking for industry collaborators to scale up the platform for mass production. \"Our platform can be efficiently used to generate a large number of 1-alkenes that are valuable in biotechnology and polymer industries,\" says Das.",

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd's (MSEDCL) 6,600 MW tender for long-term power procurement has come under the security of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). In response to an application filed by the state power utility MSEDCL to seek approval for deviation in the standard bidding documents, the MERC has questioned the state power utility why the approval was not sought before initiating the bidding process, according to the regulator's June 25 order. The state power regulator has directed the MSEDCL to demonstrate in quantifiable terms how the proposed deviations in the bidding documents are in the consumers' interest. MSEDCL in March issued a tender to procure 1,600 MW thermal power and 5,000 MW of solar power in Maharashtra. This was just before the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha elections kicked in. The power procurement was for meeting the demand for 2033-34, i.e. 10 years from now. The MERC in its order asked MSEDCL to clarify that as the proposed power procurement being undertaken to meet the demand of 2033-34 will start commissioning in the next 2 to 4 years, so would such early contracting create any stranded capacity. The MERC also wanted to know whether the Maharashtra state power utility has tied up sufficient power to meet the projected demand before 2033-34, according to the order. The MERC asked the MSEDCL to explain the rationale for considering combined power procurement of solar and thermal from a single entity. The Commission wants to know if all future thermal power procurements would follow the same principle. According to the sources, MSEDCL is trying to conclude the tender submission in July, before the code of conduct is issued for the state elections, which are due in October 2024. According to an industry source, projects of this scale would require an investment of around Rs 40,000 crore. Any interested party that wants to participate in the tender will have to obtain offers from equipment suppliers, tie up financing and also arrange for other project essentials such as land, water and transmission. The tender does not afford sufficient time for the interested parties to arrange for these basic requirements, they said adding this may lead to restricted participation, which is not in the consumer's interest and might result in higher cost of power procurement and tariffs. Allowing sufficient time for wider participation in the tender will always be in the interest of consumers, since the power requirement is starting in 2033, the source further added. MSEDCL has been given 7 days to file submission on the queries raised by the MERC. The next date of hearing is on July 2, 2024.",

            "articleBody": "Ola CEO Bhavish AggarwalIndia's Ola Electric is working to build solid-state batteries and expects its vehicles to be powered by its own cells next year, the founder and chairman of the SoftBank Group-backed electric scooter maker said on Saturday. \"We are in very early stages of our experimentation on solid state batteries,\" said chairman Bhavish Aggarwal. Aggarwal said he expects Ola's own cells to power its electric scooters, among India's most-sold, by early next year, when commercial production begins at its cell 'gigafactory' in Southern Tamil Nadu state. The factory, owned by a unit of Ola Electric, has been selected for the government's battery manufacturing incentive scheme. Solid-state batteries are expected to offer improved safety, a longer lifespan and faster charging compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries that use flammable liquid electrolytes. But mass adoption has proved difficult due to constraints in raw material availability, intricate manufacturing processes and the resultant high costs. Japan's Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker, is a big proponent of solid-state batteries and expects to launch them globally in the next few years. Ola does not currently produce its own cells but sources them from South Korea's LG Energy Solution and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology. Localising cell manufacturing is seen as a key step in bringing down upfront costs of EVs, with cell sourcing among the biggest costs for most EV makers. The Bengaluru-based firm has already begun manufacturing of the more efficient 4680 form of battery cells, but only for testing. These cells are known to be more efficient than their widely used 2170 counterparts, but many, like Tesla, have struggled to scale up production. Ola's 4680 cells have received a key domestic certification, Aggarwal said. The company will have an initial capacity to annually produce about 1.5 gigawatt hours (GWh) worth cells, for which it has invested $100 million, he added",

            "articleBody": "Prague: Czech car maker Skoda is lining up new models, expanding sales network and also looking to forge partnerships to scale up business in India, the most important market for the brand outside Europe, according to global CEO Klaus Zellmer. The company, which currently sells models like Kushaq and Slavia in the country, aims to drive in an all-new compact SUV early next year hoping to almost double its sales volume in the market. Skoda Auto India sold around 49,000 units last year. India is the world's third-largest passenger vehicle market with annual dispatches surging to 42 lakh units in FY24.  The automaker, a part of the Volkswagen Group, is also looking to introduce electric vehicles in the country.  In an interaction here, Skoda Auto global CEO Klaus Zellmer said the automaker is willing to learn and be totally customer-centric as it considers India as the most important market for the brand after Europe.  \"Outside Europe, our most important adventure is India because this is the place to be going forward,\" he stated. India is crucial to the growth strategy of Skoda Auto as the automaker brings its broadest and most up to date product portfolio ever to customers, Zellmer said. The country also gives the brand a competitive advantage in its international expansion strategy, he added. \"There is so much happening'&brvbar; we believe in India's growth potential, and of course we will be a part of that,\" he stated. Zellmer noted that with the brand moving out from Russia and not doing so well in China, it expects to do well in India going forward. \"In a business, it is always not wise to stand on one leg. In our case, this is Europe. If it gets a little shaky, you want to stand on two legs, and the second leg for us is India,\" he said. Zellmer further said: \"India is not only the most attractive region for us outside Europe, it is also the most competitive environment.\" There are new competitors, new entrants with new cars, so it really is a predatory environment, he noted. Zellmer said the automaker has learnt its lessons and is now looking at enhanced localisation in India to be more competitive in terms of pricing. \"Often we build cars according to our own expectations, and they tend to be over-engineered. And, for that engineering, it always comes at a price tag and of course it is something that weakens our competitive position. So we need to learn, we need to be aware of the sweet spot,\" he stated. In 2018, Volkswagen (VW) announced a major rejig in plans for the Indian operations giving group firm Skoda the responsibility for the market. When asked if the company is also looking to tie up with an automotive manufacturer in India, he stated that one option is to \"stand alone\" and the other option is to find a partner.  \"I very much believe in a scenario where we find a partner to be more in tune with society, with customers, with the industry, with all the prerequisites in order to be successful,\" Zellmer noted. \"We're currently discussing with various (prospective) partners,\" he added.  He noted that the intention is that the partnership should work out well for the entities, with both bringing something to the table. It would be an equity partnership, Zellmer confirmed when asked about the details. He however did not elaborate on the entities the automaker is in talks with for the intended partnership. The Volkswagen group already has a partnership with the Mahindra group for electric vehicle components. Zellmer noted that the group would continue to invest in the country even if it continues to operate solo. He said the automaker is now gearing up to enhance its sales network in India as it gears up to introduce the compact SUV in the country. \"We have 250 touchpoints now for our customers. By the end of the year, we're looking at about 300 in order to have reasonable coverage and to really attract as many customers for that car as possible,\" Zellmer said. The brand is looking to enhance presence in smaller towns and cities with the latest expansion. Zellmer stated that the brand continues to consider other models for the market including the fully electric Enyaq. \"EV penetration in the country is expected to grow between 15-30 per cent and our global strategy is to offer customers the best of the worlds with their choice of electric or highly efficient combustion powertrains,\" he added. The automaker also aims to make India an export hub. \"Our development and manufacturing base in Pune is a springboard into ASEAN and the Middle East. The capabilities we have to build in India for India and related export capacity are helping us achieve new international sales beyond Europe,\" Zellmer said.",

The World Bank on June 29, approved USD 1.5 billion in financing to accelerate India's development of low-carbon energy.\"The financing will help India promote low-carbon energy by scaling up renewable energy, developing green hydrogen, and stimulating climate finance for low-carbon energy investments.,\" the World Bank said in a blog post.Apart from this second phase of financing stimulus, last year in June 2023, the World Bank approved the USD 1.5 billion First Low-Carbon Energy Programmatic Development Policy Operation, which supported the waiver of transmission charges for renewable energy in green hydrogen projects.With this financing, efforts will be made to enhance the market capability for green hydrogen. The emphasis will also be given to scaling up renewable energy and stimulating finance for low-carbon energy investments, as per the statement.The second Low-Carbon Energy Programmatic Development Policy Operation will support reforms to boost the production of green hydrogen and electrolyzers, critical technology needed for green hydrogen production. The operation also supports reforms to boost renewable energy penetration, for instance, by incentivizing battery energy storage solutions and amending the Indian Electricity Grid Code to improve renewable energy integration into the grid.Recognising the need to separate India's economic growth from emission growth, the World Finance Organisation pointed out that decoupling economic growth from emissions growth will require scaling up renewable energy, especially in hard-to-abate industrial sectors.It added that India will require an expansion of green hydrogen production and consumption as well as a faster development of climate finance to boost the mobilisation of finance for low-carbon investments. The reforms supported by the operation are expected to result in the production of at least 450,000 metric tons of green hydrogen and 1,500 MW of electrolyzers per year from the financial year 2025-26 onwards.In addition, it will also help to increase renewable energy capacity and support reductions in emissions by 50 million tons per year. The operation will also support steps to further develop a national carbon credit market. ",

IFFCO had approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in March seeking to restrain Triumph Offshore and SEL from issuing any share/securities to lenders for paying loans and passing any such resolution without its approval.  In its petition, IFFCO had argued that it was pre-paying the debt and it may result into dilution of its shareholding in Triumph Offshore.  A two-member bench of the NCLT allowed IFFCO to withdraw its plea.  \"Counsel for applicants seeks permission to withdraw the application. They have also filed an affidavit. In view of the same, permission is granted,\" said the NCLT order passed on June 27.  Triumph Offshore was established as a joint venture to set up a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) with Swan Energy holding the majority stake of 51 per cent.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Underscoring the employment opportunity from the adoption of retrofitting in inter-city diesel passenger buses, a recent report said that it is projected to add 6000-7000 direct jobs and 36,000-42,000 new indirect jobs over the next few years.Converting current internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric ones is known as retrofitting. The procedure entails swapping out the original engine and any associated parts for a new alternative energy source that will be installed inside the current vehicle body.The report jointly prepared by the Foundation for Economic Growth and Welfare (EGROW Foundation) in collaboration with Primus Partners further added that if the country retrofits 20,000 buses annually, it can save about 500,000 tons of diesel and reduce crude oil imports by 12.7 million barrels yearly. The industry can also contribute substantially to India's goal of creating 30-35 million new green jobs by 2047.Underscoring the benefit of retrofitting, it stated that retrofit buses significantly reduce operatingand maintenance costs compared to traditional and new electric buses. Particularly, when considering the lifespan and daily operational parameters, the cost per kilometre for retrofitted buses emerges substantially lower, reinforcing the economic argument for retrofitting.The report also analysed the financial benefit of this process and stated that it helps to achieve a faster return on investment (ROI), making it an attractive option for bus fleet operators and government authorities alike.Highlighting the benefit of adopting retrofitting It notes that an ICE bus costs more than Rs 29 per km, while an electric one costs Rs 28 per km. In contrast, a 9-metre retrofitted bus costs Rs19 per km, a 12-metre retrofitted bus with two batteries costs nearly Rs22 per km and a 12-metre retrofitted bus with three batteries costs marginally more than Rs23 per km. Thus Retrofitted 9-meter buses are 32.1 per cent more cost-effective than a new EV bus. The 9-metre retrofitted bus is the most economical option.It also outlined policy recommendations suggesting that specific policies to increase retrofitted bus numbers in India.\"The government should also incorporate retrofitting incentives into the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) policy to boost EV adoption,\" the report added.GST norms, modifying the existing vehicle scrapping policy, and revisiting state retrofit EV Policies are among the top policy recommendations of the report.Commenting on the findings, Dr. Charan Singh, Chief Executive Office at EGROW Foundation and Davinder Sandhu, Chairperson, Primus Partners in their foreword opined, \"The economic benefits of this approach are profound, extending beyond mere financial savings to broader economic revitalization and environmental improvements. Retrofitting offers a pragmatic solution, leveraging existing infrastructure while transitioning towards cleaner mobility. It represents a critical step towards sustainable urban transport, demonstrating how innovation and policy alignment can drive tangible progress.\"",

            "articleBody": "SYDNEY: Anglo American said on Sunday it was battling an underground fire at its Grosvenor metallurgical coal mine in Australia's Queensland state after a blaze ignited there on Saturday. The mine site is in the coal mining town of Moranbah, located approximately 1,000 km (621 miles) north of state capital Brisbane. It is the same mine where an explosion in May 2020 critically injured five workers. \"We are continuing to manage a combustion event underground at Grosvenor Mine, following a localised ignition at the longwall on Saturday,\" Anglo American said on Facebook on Sunday. \"Our priority is to safely extinguish the underground fire, which emergency response teams are managing from the surface.\" The site was closed, with only essential emergency services team members in attendance, it said in an earlier Facebook post. Anglo American said work had started to temporarily seal the mine from the surface, which was a \"critical step\" in stopping smoke from the fire impacting residents in the town of 9,425 people. \"Due to the highly complex and evolving nature of this event, this will take time as we need to ensure the safety of all emergency teams undertaking this work,\" the company said. All mine workers were safely evacuated after the fire ignited. A spokesperson for Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said the agency was not at the incident, which was being handled by the mine. Queensland Mines Minister Scott Stewart said there would be a \"full and thorough investigation\" into the fire, the Australian Broadcasting Corp reported on Sunday. The Grosvenor mine produced 2.797 million tons of metallurgical coal in 2023, making up 17% of Anglo American's coal output, according to its annual report. The company is the world's third largest exporter of metallurgical coal. At the mine, the company uses the longwall mining method, a method used to extract long panels of coal in a single slice.

            "articleBody": "Chandigarh: Haryana will soon get waste-to-charcoal plants, also known as green coal plants, said an official statement here on Sunday. An MoU for this plant will be signed between NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVNL) and the Haryana Government. After setting up the plants in Gurugram-Manesar and Faridabad, this initiative will be expanded to other cities in Haryana. NVVNL officers will soon visit a few sites for establishing green coal plants. \"Due to the strenuous efforts of Union Power and Housing and Urban Affairs Minister, Manohar Lal Khattar, Haryana will soon get waste-to-charcoal plants, also known as green coal plants,\" the statement said. A meeting in this regard was held on Friday evening at Shram Shakti Bhawan in New Delhi, chaired by Khattar, it said. \"The minister is highly committed to reducing the problem of the increasing quantity of municipal solid waste and using it beneficially for renewable energy production. During the meeting on waste-to-energy, detailed discussions were held on NVVNL's initiative to produce green coal from solid waste,\" the statement said. According to the statement, green coal, also known as bio-coal, is a sustainable alternative to traditional waste, as it can be blended with regular coal for electricity generation in thermal power plants. NVVNL recently established a plant in Varanasi to produce green coal from solid waste. Once fully operational, this plant will consume 600 tonnes of waste and produce 200 tonnes of green coal, leaving very little residue. NVVNL is also working in various stages to set up green coal plants in Haldwani, Vadodara, Noida, Gorakhpur, and Bhopal, it said. During the meeting, Khattar directed that green coal projects should be established in various districts of Haryana. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation Gurugram Dr Narhari Singh Bangar mentioned that the MCG has already initiated this process and shown some sites in Gurugram with the NVVNL officials. Khattar, who is also former Chief Minister of Haryana, instructed that the MC, in collaboration with NVVNL, should set up a green coal plant at Bandhwari or alternative sites around Gurugram and Manesar. He stated that this plant should be capable of consuming around 1200 tonnes of solid waste daily. Similarly, Faridabad MC should start the process with NVVNL to set up a plant with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes per day on the available land in village Mothuka. Establishing waste-to-green coal plants in Gurugram-Manesar and Faridabad will not only provide a permanent solution to the waste problem but also increase energy production, he said.",

            "articleBody": "BRUSSELS: Three-quarters of the European Union's electricity has been generated by CO2 emissions-free sources so far this year, making it the bloc's greenest power mix to date, industry data showed on Monday. Emissions-free sources produced 74% of EU electricity in January-June, of which 50% was from renewable sources like wind and solar, and 24% from nuclear, industry association Eurelectric said. \"The electricity generation of Europe has never had such a low-carbon profile before,\" Eurelectric Secretary General Kristian Ruby told Reuters. Coal produced 9% of EU electricity and gas 13% - the lowest shares for each fossil fuel for the same period in any year to date. The main driver of Europe's changing energy mix is the rapid installation of renewable energy capacity. The EU built 56 gigawatts of new solar power capacity in 2023 - the highest in any year to date - and 16GW of new wind capacity. However, Europe's electricity demand has also decreased, making it easier for green sources to cover a bigger share of the overall mix. EU power demand was 5.8% lower in the first half of this year than in the same period in 2021. European energy prices surged to record highs in 2022 after Russia slashed gas supplies to Europe. The resulting energy crisis forced industries and consumers to use less energy to curb their bills - with some industries yet to recover production to pre-crisis levels, depressing their energy consumption. More renewable energy will help Europe meet its climate targets and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. But there are signs countries' ageing power grids are struggling to cope with the changing energy mix. Belgian power grid operator Elia warned last month that a recent jump in Belgium's solar power capacity will cause periods of surplus cheap energy this summer, making it harder to balance the grid. Ruby urged policymakers to invest in upgrading power grids to cope with bigger shares of renewable capacity, including by adding storage capacity to absorb cheap excess power so it doesn't go to waste. \"We need a physical build-out of the grid with quite a bit of urgency,\" he said.

The country's share of coal in electricity generation rose for the fifteenth straight year in 2023, the data showed, despite a target to cut dependence on the fuel to less than half of total power output by 2030. Kosovo had the highest coal dependence in 2023 according to the data released by Ember, with 88.21% of its power coming from the polluting fuel. Mongolia, South Africa, India and Kazakhstan followed by the Philippines ranked 7th on the list. Coal accounted for 61.92% of all electricity generated in the archipelago in 2023, from 59.07% in 2022 - the highest jump in dependence on the fossil fuel since 2016. The Philippines wants to double solar additions and triple wind capacity in 2030 from current levels and is betting on a rapid build out of offshore wind farms. While the Philippines surpassed Indonesia, ranked 8th, in terms of share of coal in power generation, coal continued to be Indonesia's preferred fuel. China fell outside of the top 10 in 2023 as an acceleration in renewables helped cut the share of coal in its electricity generation, but it remained the largest overall generator of coal-fired power, with India second. \"Both Indonesia and the Philippines lag behind other countries in the ASEAN region in their wind and solar deployment,\" Ember said in a statement on Monday. Indonesia and the Philippines have struggled to boost renewable capacity due to the costs involved. Indonesia became the world's fifth largest generator of coal-fired power, with output growing at an average pace of 7.1% over 8 years to overtake South Korea for the first time. \"This ascent included surpassing Australia in 2018, Germany in 2019, Russia in 2020 and South Africa in 2022,\" Ember said.

            "articleBody": "It also banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, in addition to imposing a ban on technology to extract and separate rare earths.  China has unveiled a list of rare earth regulations aimed at protecting supplies in the name of national security, laying out rules on the mining, smelting and trade in the critical materials used to make products from magnets in electric vehicles to consumer electronics. The regulations, issued by the State Council or cabinet on Saturday, say rare earth resources belong to the state, and that the government will oversee the development of the industry around rare earths - a group of 17 minerals of which China has in recent years become the world's dominant producer, accounting for nearly 90% of global refined output. Their global industrial significance is such that under a law that entered into force in May the EU set ambitious 2030 targets for domestic production of minerals crucial in the green transition - particularly rare earths due to their use in permanent magnets that power motors in EVs and wind energy. EU demand is forecast to soar sixfold in the decade to 2030 and sevenfold by 2050. The new Chinese regulations, which will take effect on Oct. 1, say the State Council will establish a rare earth product traceability information system. Enterprises in rare earth mining, smelting and separation, and the export of rare earth products, shall establish a product flow record system, shall \"truthfully\" record the flow, and shall enter it into the traceability system, the State Council said. China already last year introduced restrictions on exports of the elements germanium and gallium, used widely in the chip-making sector, citing the need to protect national security and interests. It also banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, in addition to imposing a ban on technology to extract and separate rare earths. Those rules fanned fears that restrictions in rare earth supplies might help increase tensions with the West, particularly the United States, which accuses China of using economic coercion to influence other countries. Beijing denies the claim. China's rare earths regulations also come as the EU gears up to impose provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs on July 4 to protect the 27-state bloc from what it says is a flood of EVs produced with unfair state subsidies, though both sides have said they plan talks on the proposed tariffs.

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Google said it has taken a stake in Taiwan's New Green Power and could buy up to 300 megawatts of renewable energy from the BlackRock fund-owned firm to help cut its carbon emissions and those of suppliers. Companies are being pushed to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to their operations and value chains by investors and Big Tech firms have been among the most ambitious in their targets. Google aims to constantly run on carbon-free energy wherever it operates. Yet sector growth in demand for data-processing capacity to power artificial intelligence has seen emissions jump. Taiwan, a major site for Google's cloud technology with a data centre and company offices, still relied on fossil fuels to generate nearly 85% of its power, Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's Global Head of Data Center Energy told Reuters. \"The goal of this investment is really to support the build out of a large-scale solar pipeline in Taiwan,\" Corio added. Regions such as Asia Pacific can be harder to decarbonise due to less developed infrastructure and restrictions limiting the ability of corporate users to buy green power. New Green Power, owned by a fund managed by BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure business, was one of the leading solar developers and operators in Taiwan, BlackRock's Global Head of Climate Infrastructure David Giordano told Reuters. Google and BlackRock both declined to specify the size of the equity stake being taken in NGP, but Corio said the investment was expected to drive the equity and debt financing for the build-out of its 1 gigawatt (GW) pipeline. Taiwan is targeting 20 GW of solar capacity by 2025 and up to 80 GW by 2050, BlackRock said. Corio said that as well as using some of the solar power it buys to drive its own operations, Google would also be able to offer some to its suppliers and manufacturers in the region. Sharing with suppliers would help Google lower its so-called Scope 3 emissions, those tied to its value chain, she added. ",

            "articleBody": "The construction of the Rs 12,940-crore 'Urja Ganga' gas pipeline, India's most ambitious project taking environment-friendly fuel to eastern parts of the country, has been delayed by nine months and will now be completed by March 2025, state-owned GAIL (India) Ltd said. The 3,306-kilometre Jagdishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra pipeline was originally targeted for completion by June 2024. But due to \"delay in right of use (RoU) availability\", the completion schedule has been revised \"from June 2024 to March 2025\", GAIL said in a stock exchange filing. The bulk of the pipeline has already been constructed, and gas has started to flow in most cities along the route. Traditionally, natural gas was available for use as fuel to generate electricity, make fertiliser or turn into CNG and cooking gas only in the western and northern parts of the country, as pipelines taking the fuel from source to users were limited to these parts. In October 2016, work on laying a pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal, Bokaro in Jharkhand and Dhamra in Odisha began. The line was extended to Guwahati in Assam from Barauni in Bihar, a length of 726 km, to take the fuel to hereto-unconnected states in the eastern region. The Jagdishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline (JHBDPL), popularly called the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga pipeline, is to supply gas to the eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. GAIL, the firm executing the pipeline, said its board of directors in a meeting on June 28 approved the revision of the completion schedule. The completion schedule for the 240-km Dhamra-Haldia pipeline has also been revised from June 2024 to March 2025, it added. The company on May 10, 2019, stated that it has completed awards of all major contracts worth Rs 10,500 crore for pipeline supply and laying of the integrated 3400-km Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) and Barauni-Guwahati Pipeline (BGPL) pipeline. The government provided 40 per cent viability gap funding amounting to Rs 5,176 crore for execution of JHBDPL. For the Barauni-Guwahati pipeline, a 60 per cent viability gap funding, amounting to Rs 5,559 crore, has been provided by the government. The Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga pipeline will connect all the geographical areas (more than 90) spread over Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and further to the northeastern region of India. When the project is fully completed, the northeastern/eastern part of India will become an integral part of the gas-based economy with the twin benefits of the cheapest gas transportation through Urja Ganga and gas pricing reforms. Under the unified tariff regulations recently notified by sector regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), transportation tariff has been cut by about 50 per cent to Rs 99.90 per million British thermal units for the eastern parts, helping make the clean fuel more affordable. The pipeline has already started feeding seven city gas distribution (CGD) projects in Varanasi, Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, and Cuttack. The pipeline also connects the refineries, located at Barauni, Haldia, and Paradip. The JHBDPL has a transmission capacity of 16 million cubic metres of natural gas a day.",

            "articleBody": "Oil prices edged up in early trade on Monday, supported by forecasts of a supply deficit stemming from peak summer fuel consumption and OPEC+ cuts in the third quarter, although global economic headwinds and rising non-OPEC+ output capped gains. Brent crude futures rose 16 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $85.16 a barrel by 0032 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $81.71 a barrel, up 17 cents, or 0.2 per cent. Both contracts gained around 6 per cent in June, with Brent has settling above $85 a barrel in the past two weeks, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, extended most of its deep oil output cuts well into 2025.  That led analysts to forecast supply deficits in the third quarter as transportation and air-conditioning demand during summer draw down fuel stockpiles. Hopes of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and rising geopolitical concerns in Europe and between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah have also kept a floor under prices, IG analyst Tony Sycamore said in a note. WTI's recent rally may extend towards $85 a barrel if prices remain above the 200-day moving average at $79.52, he said. In the US, oil production and demand rose to a four-month high in April, according to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Petroleum Supply Monthly report published on Friday. Traders are watching out for the impact from hurricanes on oil and gas production and consumption in the Americas. The Atlantic hurricane season started with Hurricane Beryl on Sunday. Beryl, the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record, headed toward the Caribbean's Windward Islands where it is expected to bring life-threatening winds and flash flooding on Monday, the US National Hurricane Center said. In China, the latest manufacturing data did not bode well for oil demand in the world's no.2 consumer and top crude importer. China's manufacturing activity fell for a second month in June while services activity slipped to a five-month low, an official survey showed on Sunday, keeping alive calls for further stimulus as the economy struggles to get back on its feet.",

With seven solar plants, a solar carport, and floating solar panels, it has an installed capacity of 50 MW at present. &ldquo;We have decided to double our installed capacity of solar power generation in the next 5-10 years and are prepared to develop more solar production plants if there is a hike in energy needs, which means development of additional energy sources in adjacent districts,&rdquo; Suhas said in an exclusive interaction.He said that this target involves the installation of new solar plants in remote locations, similar to the Payyanur plant. &ldquo;The investment for scaling up solar capacity will be substantial, reflecting the ambitious targets set by CIAL. This investment will be meticulously planned, sourced from a combination of internal funds and green energy subsidies,&rdquo; he added.In addition to solar projects, CIAL also plans to venture into run-of-the-river hydroelectric projects &ndash; it already has a commissioned project in Arippara. &ldquo;The identification of suitable locations for both solar and hydro projects is underway, ensuring that the chosen sites will optimise energy production while minimising environmental impact,&rdquo; he said. He added that with these initiatives, CIAL will also contribute excess power to the state grid.On the recent MoU with BPCL for a green hydrogen pilot plant, CIAL&rsquo;s MD informed that they are exploring an integrated production model to produce green hydrogen where the electricity will be sourced from CIAL&rsquo;s solar plants. &ldquo;The plan for the green hydrogen plant has been set in motion since the agreement in February 2024. While specific milestones and the current stage of development have not been detailed, such projects typically follow a phased approach, starting with design, procurement, construction, and commissioning,&rdquo; he said. He added that the timeline for completion can vary, but pilot projects like this one might take a year or two to become fully operational.In February this year, CIAL signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-run Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) for setting up the country&rsquo;s first green hydrogen plant in an airport.According to the agreement, BPCL will invest Rs 30 crore which will cover the costs of technology, infrastructure, and operations management of the 1,000 kW plant at Kochi Airport. Whereas, CIAL will provide suitable land, water, and green energy for the plant which is expected to be completed in early 2025.On new technology adoption, Suhas said that they are exploring the potential of smart grid technologies. &ldquo;We are actively monitoring advancements in areas such as energy storage solutions, geothermal energy, and bioenergy, which could complement our existing infrastructure. Additionally, we are exploring the potential of smart grid technologies to improve energy efficiency and management,&rdquo; he said. He added that their approach is to evaluate and pilot new technologies that can enhance CIAL&rsquo;s operational efficiency. CIAL produces 200,000 units of power daily which exceeds the airport&rsquo;s needs, making it power positive. By April 2024, it generated 35 crore units of power, cutting carbon emissions by 28,000 metric tonnes annually.",

CSL said it has won an international order from Wilson ASA, Norway, for the design and construction of four 6,300 TDW dry cargo vessels. \"An agreement has also been entered into for an additional four vessels of the same type, which will be formally contracted within September 19, 2024,\" a CSL release said. CSL said the new order was a continuation of the contract awarded in June 2023 for the design and construction of six 3800 TDW dry cargo vessels, which are now at advanced levels of construction at the yard at Udupi in Karnataka. \"The vessel is of 100 meters length and has a deadweight of 6300 metric tonnes at a design draft of 6.5 metres. The vessels shall be designed by Conoship International, Netherlands, and shall be constructed as an environment-friendly diesel-electric vessel for the transport of general cargo in the coastal waters of Europe,\" CSL said. It said the overall project of eight vessels was worth about Rs 1,100 crore and was to be executed by September 2028. Wilson ASA, a company headquartered in Bergen, Norway, is the leading short-sea fleet operator in Europe and transports about 15 million tonnes of dry cargo across Europe, CSL said. The company operates a fleet of around 130 vessels, ranging from 1500 to 8500 DWT. Since the takeover of the yard by Cochin Shipyard Limited, UCSL has successfully delivered two 62T Bollard Pull Tugs to Ocean Sparkle Limited, an Adani Harbour Services Limited Company and one 70T Bollard Pull Tug to Polestar Maritime Limited, the first lot of the tugs with Approved Standard Tug Design &amp; Specifications (ASTDS) promulgated by the Government of India for Indian Ports. UCSL has also received further orders of four 70T Bollard Pull Tugs as repeat orders from Ocean Sparkle Limited (three) and Polestar Maritime Limited (one).",

The production of the eight sectors grew 6.7 per cent in April. The growth of these core sectors -- coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertiliser, steel, cement and electricity -- was 5.2 per cent in May 2023. The official data showed that fertiliser, crude oil, and cement output recorded negative growth in May. During April-May this fiscal, the output of these sectors was up 6.5 per cent against 4.9 per cent in the same period last fiscal. The production growth of coal, natural gas and electricity rose by 10.2 per cent, 7.5 per cent and 12.8 per cent, respectively, against 7.2 per cent, (-) 0.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent in May 2023. The growth rate in the production of refinery products and steel slowed down to 0.5 per cent and 7.6 per cent during the month under review. The eight core sectors contribute 40.27 per cent to the country's Index of Industrial Production (IIP). Commenting on the data, Icra Ltd Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said that while the core sector growth sustained above 6 per cent for the fourth consecutive month, it eased slightly in May. A combination of factors, including the heatwave over parts of the country and the phased parliamentary elections could have curtailed activity and execution in some sectors, she added. \"At the same time, the heatwave boosted demand for power, which translated into a rise in the growth of coal and electricity in May 2024 compared to the previous month. We expect IIP growth print at 4-5 per cent in May 2024,\" she added.",

            "articleBody": "Una: Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu laid the foundation stone of the 10 MW solar power project at Aghlor in Kutlehar Assembly Constituency of Una district on Friday. The project will be constructed in an area of 19 hectares and completed within three months. It will produce 22.73 million units of power every year, generating an income of Rs 8 crore. This project will also help in reducing 791 tonnes of carbon emission, a statement issued here said. The chief minister said this was the second solar power project in Una district after the 32 MW Pekhubela project, which was completed within a record time of six months and will generate income of Rs 20 crore. He said that despite being a power-plus state, Himachal Pradesh purchases electricity from the open market between October and March by spending around Rs 1,500 crore as the power production in the hydroelectric projects minimises during winters due to receding water level in rivers. The state government has signed an agreement with the Oil India Company for the production of green hydrogen and emphasis was being laid on harnessing solar energy, he said, adding that the government was also encouraging harnessing solar power in the private sector as well. Sukhu, who also inspected water sports activities in Andrauli in the Kutlehar, said the state government was giving added priority to the promotion of the tourism sector. He noted that the government would develop the Andrauli area to increase footfall, besides making it an attraction for tourists visiting the state. Tourism was an important sector for strengthening the state's economy and offers ample employment and self-employment opportunities to the youth, he added. He further said the government was actively promoting religious, adventure and eco-tourism to ensure that those visiting the state have a memorable experience to cherish. He reiterated that the government aims to attract five crore tourists annually in the near future.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Centre has extended the advisory for coal blending in thermal power stations to ensure an uninterrupted power supply in light of rising demand. The ministry of power has issued a directive to all GENCOs, including Independent Power Producers (IPPs), to continue blending imported coal at a minimum of 6 per cent by weight with domestic coal until June 2024.This directive comes as a strategic response to a substantial gap of approximately 12 million tonnes between the receipt of domestic coal and its consumption noted from September 1 to October 9, 2023. Originally set at a 4 per cent blending rate before adjusting to 6 per cent, the policy aims to enhance power production and address the shortfall in domestic coal supplies.Despite increased domestic coal production and improved logistics, power demand peaked at 250 GW in May 2024 due to high consumption rates during the summer season. The Ministry's review highlighted that logistical challenges during monsoon seasons historically lead to reduced coal supply, affecting power generation.The ministry emphasized the government's commitment to ensuring stable and uninterrupted power supply throughout the country. \"Maintaining adequate coal reserves in domestic coal-based plants by all Central/State GENCOs and IPPs is crucial to meet the peak power demand during the upcoming summer months,\" it added.The extension of the coal blending advisory reflects the government's proactive approach to managing the nation's energy requirements and stabilizing the power generation sector amidst fluctuating global energy markets and domestic supply challenges.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India, holding the fifth-largest coal reserves globally and ranking as the second-largest consumer, has seen notable changes in its coal production and import patterns, reflecting a strategic shift towards enhancing energy self-reliance.According to recent data, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for coal production in India rose from 4.44 per cent during the fiscal years 2004-05 to 2013-14, to approximately 5.63 per cent from 2014-15 to 2023-24. This growth signifies the country's concerted efforts to increase domestic coal output in the past decade.Concurrently, the CAGR for coal imports saw a significant decrease. From a high of 21.48 per cent between 2004-05 and 2013-14, it plummeted to just 2.49 per cent from 2014-15 to 2023-24. Furthermore, the share of imported coal in overall consumption also dropped, with the CAGR plummeting from 13.94 per cent in the earlier period to around -2.29 per cent in the latter period.These trends underscore India&rsquo;s strategic focus on reducing dependence on imported coal, despite the necessity for imports to meet specific industrial needs such as steel production, due to the unavailability of coking coal and high-grade thermal coal within domestic reserves.The shift is part of India's broader aim to optimize its indigenous coal resources and leverage innovative technology to bolster energy security. This approach aligns with the national goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), emphasizing the importance of self-sufficiency in critical sectors such as energy.As India progresses on this path, the reduction in import dependency and the enhancement of domestic coal production capacities are set to play pivotal roles in the country's energy landscape.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The government is in the process of finalising a policy to offer washed PCI coal to steel makers in order to reduce imports, a senior official said on Friday. PCI (pulverized coal injection) coal is a type of metallurgical coal, which is used in the steel making process as auxiliary fuel for partial replacement of coke. It helps steel plant increase efficiency and reduce carbon emissions.  \"We are actually thinking about a policy...whereby we will be washing and offering washed PCI coal to the steel sector (only specifically to the steel sector) end use so that we will be able to reduce imports,\" M Nagaraju, additional secretary, coal, said at a workshop on coal matrix for the Indian metals industry organised by industry body Ficci here.  He also said that there was a need to remove ash content in PCI coal.  At present, most of the steel makers in the country import PCI coal and its demand is expected to go up to anywhere between 20-30 million tonnes by 2030, Nagaraju said.  \"We are finalising a policy and once done, we will be able to offer washed coking coal to the steel sector specifically so that they are able to blend with the imported coking coal and reduce imports,\" he said.  Nagaraju further said that the government will set up about eight coking coal washeries to meet the demand of the steel sector.  \"We are going to set up about eight coking coal washeries so that by 2030 we will be having at least 60 million tonnes of washed coking coal in the country to meet the steel sector demand,\" he added.  According to mjunction services -- a B2B e-commerce platform -- India's coking coal imports rose to 57.22 million tonnes in FY24 compared to 54.46 MT imported in FY23. Imports of PCI coal also increased to 16.69 MT in 2023-24, against 15.69 MT a year ago. MT",

Speaking at the FICCI workshop titled 'Coal Matrix for Indian Metals Industry', Nagaraju outlined the government's robust plan for the coal sector, including a significant focus on reducing import dependencies and enhancing domestic capabilities.The government has initiated the coking coal mission with a strategic target to reach 140 million tons by 2030. As part of this plan, Nagaraju announced the establishment of eight coking coal washeries to meet the increasing demand of the steel sector. \"By 2029-30, we should have the capacity to produce as much coal as the country demands and be in a position to supply coal to other countries,\" he said.Furthermore, the Ministry of Coal is in the process of finalizing a policy that will facilitate the washery route for coking coal, which will help in offering washed coking coal to the steel industry for blending with imported coal. This move is aimed at enhancing the quality of domestic coal and reducing the steel sector's reliance on foreign coal.In addition to these initiatives, the government is also promoting coal gasification with an allocation of Rs 8,500 crore to support the set-up of coal gasification plants by both private and public sectors. Nagaraju highlighted the potential for diversification within the coal industry through this initiative.Avinash Kumar Mishra, Executive Director (Coal) at the Railway Board, emphasized the logistical support being planned to aid the coal sector. He noted that the Railways would offer specialized wagons for transporting coal, particularly for the emerging coal gasification market. Mishra also mentioned the significant improvement in coal availability over the last two years, attributing it to increased imports which are expected to reduce as domestic production escalates.",

Many of the vehicles affected by tariffs are fitted with batteries from CATL, which is aiming to ramp up its operations in Europe next year.Based in the coastal Chinese city of Ningde, the company is currently building a second European factory in Hungary.At home, the firm's success in recent years has been galvanised by rapid growth in the domestic market.Not only had China seen \"a massive introduction\" of personal car ownership over the past 30 years, but also the establishment of \"the capability, the entire supply ecosystem\" for EVs, Ni said.This gave Chinese firms a huge advantage in the global shift towards green transport.\"There's already capability for China to go quickly,\" he said.",
