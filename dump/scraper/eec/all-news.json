            "articleBody": "BERLIN: Germany will block the planned sale of Volkswagen subsidiary MAN Energy Solutions' gas turbine division to a Chinese company, two government sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The government is expected to rubber-stamp the decision at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the people said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. GHGT belongs to the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), which dominates the Chinese shipbuilding industry. MAN Energy Solutions said last September that the German government would take a closer look at the planned sale to Chinese state-owned CSIC Longjiang GH Gas Turbine Co (GHGT), which was first announced in June 2023 at an undisclosed price. Germany's Economy Ministry, which has the right to critically review and block transactions with regard to their implications for national security, declined to comment. Volkswagen and MAN Energy Solutions were not immediately available for comment.

This will be the first time in India that such a tender would be floated on this scale, Gupta told reporters on the sidelines of India Energy Storage Week 2024, organised by India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) on Wednesday.  \"The tender is expected to be out by the end of this financial year 2024-25. There have been (solar thermal) tenders but not of this scale,\" Gupta said in reply to a question on new solar thermal tenders.  The earlier tenders were small in size and their costs were also too high, he said.  The projects under the 500 MW tender will have advanced technology where steam would be generated through heat and it would also help in running turbines, he added.  Besides, the prices will be at par with other Round the Clock (RTC) solutions, Gupta said without elaborating further.  Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) is a nodal agency of the central government for auctioning renewable energy projects. RTC projects include solar wind capacity with battery storage.",

            "articleBody": "The gap in demand for electric vehicles between large and mid-sized cities in the country is shrinking and the Tier-II 2 cities are likely to emerge as the next big demand centre for EVs, a report said on Tuesday. An analysis of the electric two-wheeler and car sales by strategic research provider BloombergNEF (BNEF) from 207 cities across 10 states also suggests that the electric two-wheeler sales in some tier 2 markets have surpassed metropolitans while within tier 2 cities, state capitals generally leading the growth in electric car sales. India's electric vehicle sales are growing rapidly but vary considerably across the country's 36 states and union territories. While wealthier, populous and more developed tier 1 cities are the current hubs of India's EV demand, adoption in tier 2 cities is growing, BloombergNEF said in its report. The states covered under the report include Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. A potentially large auto market and the expansion strategies of EV makers could make these tier 2 cities the next big demand centre for EVs while in smaller cities with limited awareness and disposable income, policy support will be crucial in amplifying EV sales, it said.  According to the report, Karnataka capital Bengaluru is ahead of other tier 1 cities in EV adoption -both in the passenger vehicle and two-wheeler segments with the EV growth in the wealthier cities being driven by several factors, such as a young demographic with regular disposable income, the expanding presence of pure-play EV cab operators and increasing availability of EV models to choose from.  On the other hand, Rajasthan's capital Jaipur accounted for more than 79 per cent of all electric cars sold in the state's five tier 2 cities that were analysed. Consumers in Jaipur bought more than 2,400 electric cars in 2023, more than doubling from the less than 1,000 vehicles sold a year earlier, it said.  Similarly, UP capital city Lucknow led the state's stellar sales growth in 2023, with demand reaching 1,120 units while Kerala's capital Thiruvananthapuram was at the forefront of sales numbers in the state with 840 electric cars sold and Gurugram, a fast-growing city that shares a border with the national capital Delhi, saw nearly 1,570 electric cars getting sold in 2023, it said.  Noting that most of India's tier 2 cities do not have a robust EV ride-hailing market yet which is a key pillar of rising EV sales in tier 1 cities, the report said that this means EV sales in smaller cities are entirely driven by private uptake.  Most private electric cars purchased in 2023 were not supported by upfront price subsidies. Just two out of the top 10 states for annual electric car sales had active subsidies as of the end of 2023. Even after several states exhausted their subsidy limit by the middle of the year, sales continued to hold steady, as per the report.  Stating that the annual growth rates of high-speed electric two-wheeler sales in tier 2 and tier 3 cities across the 10 states surpassed those in tier 1 cities, it said that In 2023, the annual rate of increase of total EVs sold in 70 tier 2 cities and 131 tier 3 cities was 51 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Electric two-wheeler markets in several tier 2 cities are far ahead of those in tier 1 cities. In 2023, electric two-wheelers sold in Surat (20,150 vehicles) and Jaipur (18,600) exceeded those in Ahmedabad (17,300), Mumbai (13,800) and Chennai (13,710) while the sales in Nagpur (13,730) were close to those in the state capital, Mumbai, it said. Kolhapur and Indore are also quickly catching up, with sales reaching 9,320 and 9,200 vehicles, respectively, in 2023, as per the report. Tier 2 cities could be the next growth drivers for electric two-wheelers, but financial support is crucial in tier 3 cities, Bloomberg NEF said. In 2023, the growth rate of the two-wheeler market in tier 2 cities was similar to that in tier 1. Automakers are rapidly expanding their sales and dealership networks in smaller cities, which will help improve consumer awareness and access to these vehicles, it said.  As the focus shifts to boosting demand from less affluent tier 3 cities, demand-side policy support, especially financial subsidies, will be needed unless prices fall fast enough for EVs to achieve upfront cost parity with gasoline vehicles, the report stated.",

            "articleBody": "Tangier: After the United States passed new subsidies designed to boost domestic electric vehicle production and cut into Beijing's supply chain dominance, Chinese manufacturers began investing in an unlikely place: Morocco. In the rolling hills near Tangiers and in industrial parks near the Atlantic Ocean, they have announced plans for new factories to make parts for EVs that may qualify for USD 7,500 credits to car buyers in the United States.  Similar investments have been announced in other countries that share free trade agreements with the United States, including South Korea and Mexico.  But few countries have seen the kind of boom that Morocco has.  At least eight Chinese battery makers have announced new investments in the North African kingdom since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the USD 430 billion US law designed to fight climate change, according to an Associated Press tally.  By moving operations to US trading partners like Morocco, Chinese players that have long dominated the battery supply chain are seeking a pathway to cash in on increasing demand from American carmakers like Tesla and General Motors, said Kevin Shang, a senior battery analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.  \"Chinese companies definitely don't want to miss this big party,\" he said.  The United States and European Union have both imposed major new tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports since May.  The United States also finalised eligibility rules governing the tax credits in May. The latter limit companies with ties to US adversaries, but give carmakers time to reduce their reliance on China. To qualify for the subsidies, carmakers cannot source critical minerals or battery parts from manufacturers in which China and other \"foreign entities of concern\" control more than 25 per cent of the company or its board.  Critics say the rules are a giveaway to China and will extend its EV dominance. The Biden administration says the rules pave the way for billions in investment in EV manufacturing in the United States.  Between East and West  In Morocco, a largely agrarian economy where the median income is USD 2,150 a month, giant industrial parks full of American, European and Chinese component makers have sprung up in the rural outskirts of Tangiers, Kenitra and El Jadida.  Expanding on infrastructure that has made Morocco a car manufacturing hub, they hope to meet growing demand and overcome rules designed to exclude them from the incentives the Inflation Reduction Act is injecting into the US car market, the world's second-largest.  The rules \"have led Chinese producers to increase investment in countries with whom the US has free trade agreements, namely South Korea and Morocco, to get past some IRA barriers,\" the policy research firm Rhodium Group said in a report earlier this year.  Some of the new China investments in Morocco explicitly cite the new US subsidies as a reason.  Many are joint ventures that have cited their ability to tinker with board seats and governance to comply with US rules.  That includes CNGR, one of China's largest battery cathode producers, which in September announced a USD 2 billion plan to build what it called a \"base in the world and pan-Atlantic region\" in a joint venture with the Moroccan royal family's investment group, Al Mada.  Though CNGR owns slightly more than a 50 per cent stake in the project, Thorsten Lahrs, CEO of its Europe division, said he's confident its cathodes can qualify for the tax credits and change its board composition if necessary. If not, the company would pivot to other markets, including Europe, which just hiked tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China.  \"To ride the wave of the IRA, you have to execute fast and comply with its regulations,\" he said in an interview before the US finalised its rules. \"We have flexibility to be able to comply with all the changes in interpretation or rules.\"  The Chinese battery projects include at least three joint ventures and several that reference Morocco's trade ties with the United States.  The largest among them is Chinese-German battery-maker Gotion High-Tech, which signed a deal with Morocco last year for USD 6.4 billion investment to construct Africa's first electric vehicle battery factory.  Investments also include Youshan, a joint venture backed by Korean giant LG Chem and China's Huayou Cobalt. It declined to provide details about the size of their investment but said the Morocco base means their cathodes \"will be supplied to the North American market and subsidised by the US Inflation Reduction Act as Morocco is a signatory to the US Free Trade Agreement.\"  LG Chem said the venture would adjust ownership shares as necessary to comply with US rules.  China's BTR Group's announcement of a cathode factory in April noted that Morocco's trade status with the United States and Europe would ensure \"a seamless entry for the majority of its manufactured products into these regions.\"  Abdelmonim Amachraa, a supply chain expert who previously worked in Morocco's Ministry of Industry and Trade, said Morocco was profiting from its \"ability to coexist when a link can't be found between China and the United States.\"  Officials in Morocco have publicly and privately worked to foster ties up and down the automotive supply chain in both the East and the West. The country hosts more than 250 companies that manufacture cars or their components, including Stellantis and Renault as well as Chinese, Japanese, American and Korean factories that make seats, engines, shock absorbers and wheels. The industry exports almost USD 14 billion in cars and parts annually.  As the world transitions to electric vehicles, Morocco may appear to be a surprising beneficiary as China, the United States and Europe compete for market share. But its officials worry that anti-competitive policies like tariffs and subsidies could ultimately make it more difficult to lure investment.  Ryad Mezzour, the country's minister of industry and trade, said in an interview that all the new investment doesn't tell the full story. Morocco has also lost out on some projects due to what he called \"a new age of protectionism.\"  A giant loophole  The investment has been a boon to countries like Morocco. But in Washington, Chinese firms have raised alarm by angling to access the American subsidies.  \"Under the Biden administration's electric vehicle regulations, America's working families will have to watch their hard-earned tax dollars go to line the pockets of Chinese billionaires and businesses with links to the Chinese Communist Party,\" US Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, said of the new guidelines.  But at issue are the complexities of both the electric vehicle supply chain and the Inflation Reduction Act, which seeks to grow adoption of EVs and boost domestic manufacturing, too.  The US Energy and Treasury departments have tried to strike a delicate balance, working to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturers while also ensuring enough vehicles qualify for the credits.  The Department of Energy did not respond to questions about what its rules meant for Chinese investments in countries that share free trade agreements with the United States.  But in a statement, a spokesperson called the transition to electric vehicles \"an industry-wide, global trend\" and said new policies \"help the US strengthen its energy security and competitiveness-including outcompeting China.\"  China has spent years subsidizing companies that extract critical battery minerals, manufacturers of cathodes, anodes and electrolyzers and carmakers like BYD.  Those companies' eagerness to invest in Morocco to cash in on the Inflation Reduction Act shows how decoupling Chinese manufacturers from the supply chain will take years, if not decades, said Chris Berry, an adviser to battery companies and investors.  \"There is not going to be a lithium ion battery supply chain that does not have Chinese influence for a long time,\" Berry said.

Tesla gave no detailed breakdown of the other autos delivered.During the same period it produced 410,831 vehicles, including 386,576 Model 3 and Model Y autos.\"This was a huge comeback performance from Tesla and (Elon) Musk with the Street expecting a clear miss this quarter with EV demand still choppy globally,\" said Wedbush analysts in a note.They expect \"the worst is in the rear-view mirror for Tesla,\" helped by a \"mini rebound\" in China along with price stabilization.Tesla's robotaxi, to be unveiled on August 8, should also launch a new chapter for the automaker, the analysts noted.But Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, cautioned that the decline in Tesla's second quarter deliveries is not a big shock.\"We've seen the automaker exhaust its bag of tricks by lowering prices and increasing incentives to spur demand without much success in the US market,\" she said.She added that \"times are tough for Tesla,\" noting that its sales techniques could have \"long-term negative consequences.\"In a separate statement, GM said Tuesday that it delivered 696,086 units in the United States, up 0.6 percent on-year.But this was a markedly slower pace than last year's 19 percent jump.GM reported a 17 percent rise in retail EV registrations, above the industry's 10 percent gain.On the start-up front, Rivian said Tuesday it produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 in the second quarter -- levels in line with its forecasts.The company saw a stock market boom after German automaker Volkswagen said in June that it was investing $5 billion -- including $1 billion directly in Rivian -- to create a joint venture specializing in automotive software.Nikola, a start-up manufacturer of hydrogen-powered and electric trucks, said it sold 72 hydrogen-powered vehicles in the quarter, exceeding its target of 60.",

            "articleBody": "BANGKOK: Thai authorities are investigating BYD's dealers after a consumer complaint over aggressive discounting in a key international market for the Chinese EV giant that has left some buyers upset with how much they paid for their cars. The office of the Thai Prime Minister instructed the country's consumer protection agency to launch the probe. It was triggered after a BYD customer alleged that a sales representative had asserted the customer's car's price would rise after a discounting campaign ended but instead the dealership later aggressively cut the price further, according to a government statement. BYD officials in Thailand and its sole distributor Rever Automotive, which has a network of over 100 dealerships, did not immediately respond to Reuters emails seeking comment. \"We have called the dealers to come in this week to clarify why they cut prices further and how they plan to find a solution for customers,\" Passakorn Thapmongkol, a senior official at the Consumer Protection Board told Reuters. On a BYD owners group on Facebook, other Thai customers shared similar complaints. \"The salesperson said that prices would increase after the motor show, but in the end, it was really reduced,\" Facebook user Thanasit Chai said in a post on Wednesday, referring to the Bangkok Motor Show held in March. Thailand is the largest overseas market for the world's biggest EV manufacturer. BYD commanded a 46% share of the Thai EV market in the first quarter and is the third-largest player in passenger cars overall with share of about 9%, according to research firm Counterpoint. Other EV rivals in the market include Great Wall Motor and Tesla. BYD is scheduled to open its first EV production facility in Southeast Asia in Thailand's eastern Rayong province on Thursday. It plans to invest around $490 million in the facility to produce 150,000 cars per year. Shenzhen-headquartered BYD currently sells four models in Thailand priced between 699,999 baht and 1.59 million baht ($19,000 to $43,200), according to Rever's website. Led by BYD and Vietnam's VinFast, EV sales in Southeast Asia have more than doubled since last year at the expense of Japanese and Korean makers of traditional gasoline engine models.",

It&rsquo;s the first time the New York-based firm, founded by Nathan Anderson, has provided a tally of its winnings from last year&rsquo;s bombshell report alleging fraud and market manipulation at the Indian business empire of Gautam Adani &mdash; one of Asia&rsquo;s richest tycoons.The contrast between Hindenburg&rsquo;s gains and the wider impact underscores how opportune research can have far-reaching effects, even if it&rsquo;s not always easy to profit from the fallout. Shares and bonds of Adani Group companies swung wildly in the immediate aftermath of Hindenburg&rsquo;s report but have since recovered ground. As of Monday, the group market value was $205 billion &mdash; about $30 billion short of its pre-Hindenburg level.The scathing report earned a gross revenue of about $4.1 million through gains related to Adani shorts from &ldquo;one investor relationship&rdquo; &mdash; Hindenburg didn&rsquo;t name who &mdash; and about &ldquo;$31,000 through our own short of Adani U.S. bonds,&rdquo; according to the short seller&rsquo;s July 1 statement.Hindenburg also called out India&rsquo;s markets regulator for failing to address the fraud allegations in its report last year.Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, &ldquo;seems more interested in pursuing those who expose such practices&rdquo; while its investigation into billionaire Adani&rsquo;s empire has hit a wall, Hindenburg said. Its latest broadside comes at a time when India&rsquo;s newly energized opposition parties have been criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for crony capitalism, after the leader was returned to power with a smaller mandate than expected last month. The firm also posted on its website the full &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; notice it said it received from Sebi in June, which states that Hindenburg&rsquo;s report on the Adani Group had certain misrepresentations and inaccurate statements that were meant to mislead readers. In the 46-page document, Sebi said Hindenburg &ldquo;has resorted to extrapolation and conjecture to emphasize some facts and understate others in favor of negative inference against Adani Group Companies.&rdquo; It also said the short seller cited a broker banned from the securities market, shaking investors&rsquo; trust in the regulatory framework.Adani Group stocks shrugged off the latest missive from Hindenburg. Shares of all 10 Adani-linked firms traded higher on Tuesday, led by the energy and gas units that rallied more than 4% each.&lsquo;Masking Kotak&rsquo;Hindenburg said that Sebi&rsquo;s notice &ldquo;conspicuously&rdquo; failed to mention Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, which it said created and oversaw the offshore fund structure used by Hindenburg&rsquo;s investor partner to bet against Adani. The regulator &ldquo;masked the &lsquo;Kotak&rsquo; name with the acronym &ldquo;KMIL&rdquo;,&rdquo; it added, though Kotak is the body with ties to India. KMIL refers to Kotak Mahindra Investments Ltd, the asset management company. Kotak Mahindra Bank&rsquo;s shares slipped as much as 3% on Tuesday after Hindenburg&rsquo;s disclosures. Kotak said in a statement on Tuesday that Hindenburg has never been a client of Kotak Mahindra International Ltd.Sebi&rsquo;s notice also named US hedge fund Kingdon Capital Management as an involved party, stating that Kingdon knew about Hindenburg&rsquo;s research on the Adani Group before it was published and had a profit-sharing pact with the short-seller on its trades. Hindenburg shared a draft of the Adani report with Kingdon in November 2022, nearly two months before it published the report, according to the Sebi show cause notice. In return Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg. That profit-sharing then got reduced to 25%, due to the cost of setting up these trades.In January the following year, a fund controlled by Mark Kingdon transferred $43 million to the K India Opportunities Fund, which started building short positions via futures for Adani Enterprises Ltd, the conglomerate&rsquo;s flagship listed entity, the cause notice said. These short positions were later squared off by Feb. 22 and reaped $22 million. As of June 1, the Kingdon fund returned $4.1 million of the gains from the Adani short sale to Hindenburg while another $1.4 million has yet to be shared, according to Sebi. In Tuesday&rsquo;s statement, Kotak said Hindenburg has never been an investor in the K India Opportunities Fund. The Indian markets regulator didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to Bloomberg&rsquo;s request for comment. Nor did the Adani Group. Kingdon Capital Management was not immediately reachable outside of US business hours. ",

Germany, whose carmakers made a third of their sales last year in China, wants to stop the tariffs, according to a government source, while France has been among the firmest backers. But a majority of countries are still weighing the pros and cons of the escalating trade spat, according to an informal poll by Reuters of EU governments. The issue will be put to members in an advisory vote in the coming weeks, the first official test of support in a landmark case for the Commission. The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind. The bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6% on Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla, BMW and other western automakers. EU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" if at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them. France, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs. \"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said. However, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.  NEGATIVE EFFECTSGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits. Increasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices. Beijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars. The Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100% tariff is likely to do. Tariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU. Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations. \"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said. The EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show. They point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business. The document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed. It offers proof to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy. That leaves the door open to future cases. \"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\" ",

            "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Sebi has issued a show-cause notice to Hindenburg, asking why it should not act against the short-seller for violating norms related to the \"prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trading practices in the securities market\".The notice, dated June 26, was released online by Hindenburg, which took a defiant stand, charging Sebi with not acting on allegations in its Adani report. Hindenburg described the notice as \"nonsense\" and \"nebulous\" and alleged attempts to silence the firm. Hindenburg claimed it only made $4 million from the operation, which resulted in a $153 billion drop in Adani group's valuation.In a statement, Hindenburg said: \"Sebi has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimised by it.\"The thrust of Sebi's notice is that the research firm colluded with its investor partner, misled the public, and used non-public information to manipulate prices and profit from its action. Sebi has alleged that the partner, Kingdon Capital, knew about Hindenburg's research on Adani group before the report was made public and there was a profit-sharing agreement between the two. As per Sebi, Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg in exchange for receiving the report two months in advance. In a fresh twist in the Hindenburg saga, the US short seller said that Kotak Mahindra International created the offshore fund structure used by its investor partner Kingdon Capital to short Adani stocks before its report was published in Jan 2023. Kotak Mahindra Bank informed stock exchanges late on Tuesday that Sebi's showcause notice to Hindenburg and Kingdon included a fund managed by Kotak Mahindra International (KMIL).\"KMIL was informed by Kingdon that the transactions were made on a principal basis, i.e. for themselves. Kingdon never disclosed that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price sensitive information. In fact, they had expressly confirmed that any advice from Kingdon to invest would be basis purely public information,\" Kotak Bank's statement said.\"Neither the fund nor KMIL were aware that Kingdon entities had any association with Hindenburg. The fund and KMIL had no prior knowledge of the publication of the aforesaid Hindenburg report. We deny any allegation of being aware of such report or acting in collusion in any manner with Kingdon or Hindenburg,\" it said.Earlier in the day, Kotak Bank shares dropped 2.4% after Hindenburg disclosed Sebi's notice and said that a Kotak fund was one of the noticees for setting up the offshore structure. In its exchange communication, Kotak said that the showcause notice dated June 26 was received by KMIL on July 2.In its reply to Sebi's showcause notice, Hindenburg questioned the regulator for not highlighting the name of Kotak, the group that facilitated offshore investors' short-selling in Indian markets.By bringing Kotak into the picture in correspondence with Sebi, Hindenburg has sought to support its claim that the firm played by the rules while short-selling and did not cross a line between using proprietary research based on public information and \"use of advance knowledge of non-public information\" for trading, as the regulator alleged.Hindenburg reply also referred to Kotak group founder, Uday Kotak's chairmanship of 2017 Committee on Corporate Governance to bolster the legitimacy of its actions.\"We suspect Sebi's lack of mention of Kotak or any other Kotak board member may be meant to protect yet another powerful Indian businessman from the prospect of scrutiny, a role Sebi seems to embrace\" Hindenburg said.In a statement, a Kotak group spokesperson said, \"KIOF (K India Opportunities Fund - a Sebi-registered FPI regulated by Financial Services Commission of Mauritius), was established in 2013 to enable foreign clients to invest in India. The fund follows due KYC procedures while on-boarding clients and all its investments are made in accordance with all applicable laws. We have cooperated with regulators in relation to our operations and continue to do so.\"The statement also denied any knowledge of investors' association with Hindenburg. \"KMIL and KIOF unequivocally state that Hindenburg has never been a client of the firm nor has it ever been an investor in the fund.,\" the spokesperson said.",

The new development offers a sustainable solution for environmental clean-up efforts.Led by Dr. Arundhuti Devi, the team at IASST successfully tested the nanocomposite, named Ni-doped TiO2 on Fuller&rsquo;s earth (NiTF), achieving a 96.15 per cent decolorization rate of methylene blue dye under visible light within 90 minutes. This performance was observed at a pH level of 9.0, demonstrating the catalyst's high efficiency in breaking down harmful organic substances in water.The research, published in the journal 'Inorganic Chemistry Communications' by Elsevier, highlights the potential of NiTF not only in environmental applications but also across various industries, including energy storage, sensors, and renewable energy production.The study underscores the role of metal oxide photocatalysis, which utilizes catalysts like titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and tungsten trioxide, known for their ability to generate electron-hole pairs that neutralize pollutants when exposed to light.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India is in talks with Africa as well as Latin America to get critical mineral blocks on a government-to-government basis, Veena Kumari Dermal, joint secretary of the Ministry of Mines, said on Tuesday. Critical minerals such as lithium are essential components in many of today's rapidly growing clean energy technologies, including wind turbines, electricity networks, and electric vehicles.  \"We are having lots of discussions with many other resources-rich countries both in Africa as well as in Latin America for getting... a block on a G2G basis or on a priority basis,\" Dermal said at India Energy Storage Week (IESW) 2024 organised by India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA).  The mines ministry, she said, is giving more and more importance to the exploration of critical minerals in India.  At the domestic front, the government has successfully auctioned one lithium block in Chhattisgarh, the joint secretary added.  She said the Chhattisgarh government will take steps to start the exploration and production from the lithium block at the earliest.  Maiki South Mining Pvt Ltd had last month bagged the country's first lithium block in Chhattisgarh that was put up for sale.  Meanwhile, the government cancelled the auction of 14 critical minerals that were on offer in the second round of auction.  In June, the government had put on sale 21 blocks in the fourth round of auction of critical and strategic minerals.  The government received 56 physical bids and 56 online bids for 18 of the 20 blocks offered during the first tranche of the auction, which began on November 29, 2023.  However, the auction for 13 of the 20 blocks was cancelled due to a lukewarm response.  Seven of these cancelled blocks were re-notified for auction in the third round.",

            "articleBody": "MOSCOW: Russian energy giant Gazprom's average daily natural gas supplies to Europe jumped by almost 23 per cent in June from a year earlier, rebounding from last year's post-Soviet lows, although they fell 8.6 per cent from May, Reuters calculations showed on Tuesday. Exports were lower last month than in the previous month amid planned maintenance at the TurkStream undersea pipeline on June 6-9. The calculations, based on data from the European gas transmission group Entsog and Gazprom's daily reports on gas transit via Ukraine, showed that average daily pipeline exports decreased to 81.8 million cubic metres (mcm) last month from 89.5 mcm in May, but they were up from the 66.8 mcm in June 2023. Gazprom's natural gas exports to Europe this year have totalled about 15.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) so far. Europe was once Russia's primary export market but now receives much less Russian gas as a result of the political response to the conflict in Ukraine. Gazprom has instead boosted gas sales to China, which increased pipeline gas imports from Russia to 22.7 bcm last year, nearly 1.5 times more than the 15.4 bcm shipped in 2022. Gazprom has not published its own monthly statistics since the start of 2023. It did not respond to a request for comment. Russia supplied a total of about 63.8 bcm of gas to Europe by various routes in 2022, according to Gazprom data and Reuters calculations. The volume decreased further, by 55.6 per cent, to 28.3 bcm last year. At their peak in 2018-2019, annual flows to the region reached between 175 bcm and 180 bcm. ",

            "articleBody": "Mercedes-Benz India wants the government to commit to continuity in policies that support electric mobility for the next eight to ten years, for stable and better planning towards zero emission mobility, its Managing Director and CEO Santosh Iyer said on Tuesday. Besides, the company feels that providing the incentives given to electric vehicles to hybrid vehicles will extend the timeline for transition to emission free mobility.  The company, which had increased EV penetration to 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, from 2.5 per cent earlier, expects the momentum to carry going forward with three new EV models slated for launch this year, starting with the EQA next week.  \"A much more clear roadmap when it comes to taxation on EVs,\" Iyer told PTI here when asked about the company's expectations from the upcoming Union Budget.  \"We understand that the Budget may not address the GST topic, but at least if you are able to get a commitment that for the next eight to ten years, this kind of taxation benefit will continue, this will really help brands like us to plan long term and have more commitments when it comes to investments for the EVs,\" he said.  For electric vehicles the government has already given 5 per cent GST compared to 48-50 per cent on internal combustion engines, Iyer added.  Highlighting investment on infrastructure as another key aspect, he said, \"One of the biggest drivers for our growth has been the growing road infrastructure and intercity road infrastructure that has come up in the last couple of years.\"  He further said, \"one big line item that we will see in the Budget is the capital expenditure on infrastructure. We expect (it) to go up if possible, so that not only it helps demand but also the indirect benefits of it for the country also is great.\"  When asked about the discussions on extending the GST benefits given to EVs on hybrid vehicles, Iyer said, \"Currently we can see electric as the only option when it comes to zero emission driving. Now on that road, if we add newer technologies, it will delay the transition, for sure.\"  Iyer further said, \"It is up to the government and the stakeholders to see how soon they want to accelerate the transformation to carbon free mobility and emission free mobility.\" On the company's roadmap for electric mobility, he said it is committed to zero emission mobility but \"the EV transition is a marathon and not a sprint\".  \"We have already three (EV) products in the market with which we achieved 5-6 per cent penetration and we will continue with the EQA (to be launched next week) to further penetrate,\" Iyer said.  Two more EV models will be launched later this year, he added.  In the first quarter of 2024, the company had posted total sales of 5,412 units, growth of 15 per cent from the year-ago period.  On local assembly of EVs in India, Iyer said Mercedes-Benz India will consider other models too depending on demand. It currently assembles EQS at its Chakan plant.",

Speaking at the 2nd CII Conference on Smart Metering, Agarwal emphasized the need for interoperability and data integration of smart meters.Highlighting the importance of storage solutions and forecasting models, Agarwal stressed the necessity of empowering state distribution companies (DISCOMs) for better demand side management. He said, \"The current challenges the power sector is facing include the financial viability of DISCOMs and renewable energy integration. Such issues must be addressed to achieve Prime Minister&rsquo;s vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.\"The conference, themed 'Empowering Future: Accelerating Smart Meter Adoption through Innovation and Collaboration,' saw participation from officials of the Union power ministry, state governments, regulators, meter manufacturers, service providers, and digital companies.Arun Mahesh Babu, Managing Director of Gujarat Power Corp Ltd and UGVCL, underscored the importance of consumer trust in the transition to smart meters. \"Consumers must be convinced of the long-term benefits of transitioning to smart meters, and implementing agencies must work with them to build trust and resolve all queries,\" he stated.Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, co-chairman of the CII National Committee on Power and Managing Director of Apraava Energy, raised concerns about data security. He noted, \"While large data has its benefits, it must be treated with utmost care. Start-ups have a huge opportunity to leverage data to benefit DISCOMs and help consumers manage usage efficiently.\"Dr Suket Singhal, Head of the CII Core Group on Smart Metering and Group CEO of Secure Meters Pvt Ltd, highlighted the advantages of smart meters beyond controlling AT&amp;C losses. He mentioned, \"The focus should be on the 65 per cent of consumers who want to pay but face billing errors. Smart meters will ensure accurate and timely billing.\"The conference, building on the momentum of the first edition in 2022, aims to accelerate the adoption of smart meter infrastructure in India&rsquo;s power sector. It seeks to bring policymakers, regulators, and industry together to create a conducive ecosystem and policies for the implementation of over 18 crore smart meters planned nationwide.Discussions at the conference included topics such as policy and regulatory frameworks for scaling up smart metering, data efficiency and flexibility, securing the meters, and \"Make in India\" initiatives. The event focused on India's commitment to reforming and modernizing the power distribution sector, aiming to establish a robust, resilient, and flexible smart grid network capable of integrating renewable energy sources to meet the country's growing power demand.",

            "articleBody": "Oslo: Norwegian battery recycling firm Hydrovolt said Tuesday that it will expand internationally by opening a facility in France, boosting a nascent hub for producing electric vehicle batteries. The facility will open in the town of Hordain in what is becoming known as France's Battery Valley, as four major battery production facilities are set to open. \"This is a big milestone for Hydrovolt,\" chief executive Ole-Christen Enger said in a statement. \"Entry to the French market will help us maintain our position as a leading European recycler of EV and industrial batteries,\" he added. A joint venture between aluminium giant Norsk Hydro and Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt, Hydrovolt operates Europe's largest recycling used or defective electric car batteries. For electric vehicles to realise their full potential to reduce carbon emissions, recycling the batteries to reuse the valuable minerals they contain is important.Hydrovolt is able to take used batteries and turn them into a powder, or \"black mass\", made up of nickel, manganese, cobalt, lithium and graphite that can be reused to make new batteries. \"Recycling provides a new supply of battery-grade metals which is preferable to freshly mined materials,\" the company said.Hydovolt says it can recover up to 95 percent of the metals from used batteries for reuse. The EU has set recycling targets and the rush towards electric vehicles has created concerns about adequate supplies. The amount of the investment in the French facility was not given.Hydrovolt said the facility, which could open as soon as next year, would at first serve as a collection point to discharge and dismantle batteries but is suitable for recycling operations.\"It is key for us to establish a local presence across Europe to help build a circular battery value chain,\" said Enger. Hydrovolt expects European demand for batteries to grow exponentially as EU nations and Britain move towards electric vehicles.Some 50 major electric battery factories, or \"gigafactories\", have been announced in recent years in Europe as the region strives to avoid becoming fully dependent upon Asian manufacturers in the strategic industry of the future.",

Luxury sports car maker Ferrari on Monday announced two new warranty extension schemes allowing owners of its hybrid models to have the batteries of their vehicles replaced at given times. The move aims to help owners preserve the resale value of their Ferraris as batteries, which tend to lose efficiency over time, become central to the value of electrified cars. As part of its new Warranty Extension Hybrid and Power Hybrid programs Ferrari will replace the high-voltage battery packs (HVB) of the cars covered in their eighth and 16th year of life, the company said in a statement. Ferrari already offers a five-year warranty on their hybrid powertrain parts. The two programs, which will transfer to any subsequent owner, are aimed to \"preserve the performance and excellence\" of hybrid Ferraris over time, the company said. \"In case of future developments in battery technology, the replacement HVB will be a new, state-of-the-art component that will ensure the same performance as the original one,\" it said. The programs, which also offer forms of extended factory warranty on the entire cars and on their major powertrain components, can be purchased in packages renewable for two to four years. They cost around 7,000 euros (USD 7,530) a year, a source close to the matter said, adding they will also apply to Ferrari's new all-electric model due next year. The Italian automaker, famed for its roaring petrol engines, has been selling hybrid-electric cars since 2019, including the SF90 Stradale and the 296 GTB and 296 GTS. It has promised its first, fully electric vehicle at the end of 2025.",

BYD sold 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to Reuters' calculations based on its monthly sales reports. That's around 12,000 vehicles fewer than Tesla's vehicle deliveries estimated for the second quarter. Tesla is expected to report a 6% drop in April-June quarter vehicle deliveries on Tuesday, the first time the U.S. firm is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models. The company may again cede its EV championship to BYD if the actual results turn out to be softer than estimated, with Barclays predicting an 11% drop in second-quarter deliveries, Tesla's biggest ever. Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be \"notably lower\" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes. The EV maker has cut output of its best-selling Model Y electric car by a double-digit percentage number at its Shanghai plant since March to address weakening demand for its aged models in China, its second-largest market after the United States, Reuters reported in May. By comparison, its top Chinese competitor BYD maintained steady growth in EV sales, while EV upstarts such as Nio reported stellar growth last quarter. NIO's vehicle deliveries in the second quarter more than doubled to 57,300 units. Price cuts and a growing shift in consumer demand to EVs and hybrids from gasoline-powered vehicles are the main reasons behind Chinese EV makers' strong sales in recent months, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general, China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). Sales of new energy vehicles including EVs and plug-in hybrids in China made up 46.7% of total car sales in May, a fresh monthly high, as per CPCA data.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's peak power demand is projected to surpass 400 gigawatts (GW) by the 2031-32 period, exceeding the earlier forecast of 384 GW, said Power secretary Pankaj Agarwal on Tuesday.This estimation comes at a time when India has already witnessed a peak demand of 250 GW as of May 30.Speaking at the sidelines of the CII-Smart Metering Conference, Agarwal highlighted the rapid increase in power demand observed in several states over the past two years, suggesting that the initial projection of 384 GW might be an underestimate.\"The peak demand of 250 GW which we met this year is estimated to reach 384 GW by 2031-32. Given the current trends, this estimate might be easily surpassed,\" he added.To support the anticipated demand, India would require a total installed capacity of 900 GW by 2031-32. This need for increased capacity comes as the power demand exhibited a decline following the onset of the monsoon, with the demand dropping to 206 GW on Monday, from a projected peak of 260 GW expected to be reached by September this year.In support of these projections, recent trends within the Indian power sector underscore the necessity for increased capacity. The government has set a formidable goal of achieving 500 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, including substantial contributions from solar and wind energy. This ambitious target is driven by a series of policy measures aimed at promoting renewable energy and enhancing energy efficiency across the nation.Furthermore, as of May, the country's total installed power generation capacity stood at 444.7 GW comprising 242.9 GW of cumulative thermal capacity, 193.6 GW of renewables, and 8.1 GW of nuclear capacity, emphasizing a robust shift towards non-fossil fuel sources. This transition is supported by substantial foreign direct investments, reaching US$ 18.17 billion in the power sector up to December 2023, fostering growth and innovation within the sector.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: Germany's power sector is relying on cuts made to fossil fuel use for the lion's share of recent decarbonisation efforts, but will need a sustained jump in clean generation to ensure a lasting shift in power production away from polluting fuels. German power generators cut fossil fuel-powered output by 19 per cent through the opening half of 2024 from the same months in 2023, data from LSEG shows. That compares to just a 2.1 per cent rise in clean power generation from the first half of 2023, and indicates that power firms are mainly relying on cuts to fossil fuel use to make progress against energy transition aims. Those cuts to fossil fuel use have helped slash German power sector emissions, which totalled 70 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) for the first 5 months of 2024 compared to 88 million tons during January to May of 2023, data from think tank Ember shows. But sluggish industrial activity has meant that overall power demand totals are also down so far this year, which has allowed power suppliers to reduce total generation by more than 6 per cent compared to the first half of 2023. If Germany's manufacturing and industrial activity picks up momentum over the remainder of 2024, total power needs may climb in tow and could put pressure on power suppliers to increase output from fossil fuels to meet that extra demand.  COAL CUTS Coal-fired generation took the brunt of the fossil fuel output cuts, dropping by just over 17 per cent in the first half of 2024 from the same months last year. To make up for lower coal-fired generation, output from natural gas plants increased by 5 per cent in January-June 2024 from the first half of 2023, while generation from oil-fired plants rose 12 per cent and coal-derived gas plants increased output by 3.7 per cent, LSEG data shows. Altogether, total generation from fossil fuels contracted by 19 per cent during the first half of 2024, and follows a 24 per cent contraction in the whole of 2023 from the year before.  CLEAN MAJORITY The drop in fossil fuel generation has resulted in clean power sources securing a majority share of Germany's power generation mix every month since December 2022. The share of clean power in Germany's power generation mix climbed to a new high of 64.6 per cent during the first half of 2024, compared to 59.3 per cent during the same months of 2023 and an average share of 61 per cent for 2023 as a whole. That said, power firms have been unable to offset all the cuts to fossil fuel use with growth from clean energy sources, especially after Germany shut its national nuclear reactor fleet in April 2023. Nuclear reactors had accounted for around 8 per cent of total power generation in 2022, so the complete cessation of such a notable source of clean energy has been hard to replace. Wind farms have emerged as Germany's largest source of clean power, and accounted for an average share of 37 per cent of total power generation last year, according to LSEG. Solar is the second largest source of German clean power, and generated around 17 per cent of all power last year, while hydro assets generated around 4 per cent.  SEASONAL SWINGS During the first half of 2024, wind power generation climbed 7.6 per cent from the same period in 2023, while solar generation rose by 12.8 per cent and hydro output climbed 5.4 per cent. Solar output is liable to climb further during July and August during the height of summer, and could account for around 30 per cent to 35 per cent of total power generation during those months. However, generation from wind farms and hydro dams historically dip during the summer months due to slower wind speeds and reduced water flows from reservoirs. For power producers who need to maintain power supplies around the clock, the drop off in wind and hydro output may set the stage for greater generation from natural gas plants, especially if German manufacturing activity picks up steam. And any such increase in gas-fired output could in turn open the German power sector to accusations of backsliding on power clean-up commitments. To guard against that in the future, power firms will need to substantially increase total generation from clean sources and also substantially raise the storage capacity that can bridge periods of reduced clean generation. The build-out of an entirely clean power generation system may take several more years and continued high levels of annual investment in clean generation and battery construction. Until then, further periods of clean power growth followed by flare ups in fossil-fired output look likely.By Gavin Maguire",

Industry sources have said the low-priced bids from some successful projects indicated that they would be using cheaper Chinese equipment.The EU is toughening its stance against China on green technologies, to attempt to ensure European industries can compete globally and avoid deepening Europe's reliance on Beijing for key building blocks of the clean energy transition.Brussels last month announced tariffs on imported Chinese electric cars, and is investigating Chinese subsidies for wind and solar suppliers.",

The increase comes with coal being used to meet rising demand in both countries, though in the Philippines, coal generation grew by more than the rise in demand.That was because it was also used to meet a drop in production from other sources, including bioenergy and gas, Ember said.Both countries are falling behind their regional counterparts when it comes to wind and solar energy, the group said.Regionally, the two renewables account for an average of 4.4 percent of electricity generation, but just 3.2 percent in the Philippines and 0.3 percent in Indonesia.And while Indonesia generates renewable energy from hydropower, that fell 10 percent last year, possibly because of drought conditions.\"Overall, Indonesia and the Philippines are the two most coal dependent countries in Southeast Asia and their reliance on coal is growing fast,\" the group warned.Last year, Indonesia also became the world's fifth-largest coal power generator, overtaking South Korea for the first time, Ember said.The Philippines aims for renewable energy to make up 35 percent of its power generation by 2030, while Indonesia is committed to reaching 44 percent the same year.The International Energy Agency says that to reach net zero by mid-century, all coal generation that does not capture emissions must end by 2040.",

            "articleBody": "BERLIN: For months, Philip Matthias tried to convince his father to install solar panels on their company's roof in the eastern German state of Thuringia, aiming to cut electricity costs and carbon emissions at the metal products factory. Initially sceptical of the 2.3-million-euro ($2.5 million) investment, a substantial sum for the medium-sized Tridelta, his father crunched the numbers and decided to nearly double the project capacity, opting to install photovoltaic modules that could power around 900 households in addition to the factory. \"The PV systems amortize after about 7-1/2 years. The manufacturer gives a guarantee of 20 years. That means this is an extremely lucrative investment,\" Matthias told Reuters. Since the war in Ukraine and the sudden drop in Russia fossil fuel exports to Germany, Berlin has introduced laws to accelerate solar power expansion, part of its plan to cover 80 per cent of the country's energy from renewables by 2030. Encouraged by a feed-in tariff providing a guaranteed price to renewable energy producers selling their power, as well as reduced solar panel costs, German companies are increasingly turning to solar to get around high energy costs. Although Germany has Europe's biggest capacity of solar and wind power generation, its small and medium-sized companies have yet to benefit from lower electricity prices because of high grid fees and taxes they must pay. By generating their own solar power, they avoid those fees and taxes. Companies consumed around 69 per cent of Germany's national electricity in 2023, data by the BDEW utilities association showed. \"As electricity prices in Germany show no signs of decreasing as previously anticipated, companies are increasingly recognising the economic viability of installing solar panels,\" said Marie-Theres Husken, an energy expert for the BVMW association for small- and medium-sized businesses.  CORPORATE SOLAR SHIFT Newly installed photovoltaic capacity on business rooftops rose by 81 per cent year-on-year in the first four months of the year, outpacing the 1 per cent growth in the residential sector, data by the BSW solar power association shows. A May survey by pollster YouGov showed more than half of German companies with suitable roofs planned to install solar power systems in the next three years. BVMW forecasts that nearly all manufacturing companies in Germany will use solar energy by 2030. In response to increasing demand, Germany's largest residential solar power developer, Enpal, said in April it was expanding into the commercial sector. \"The demand was not as instant... but the growth is going to be very sustainable,\" Melchior Schulze Brock, CEO of commercial and industrial solar startup Enviria. An April study by the Freiburg-based Institute for Applied Ecology showed there was potential to install up to 287 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, more than enough to meet Berlin's 2030 target of 215 GW, along German roads, railways, parking lots, and industrial areas. This could significantly reduce reliance on agricultural land where permitting and planning approvals can take up to a decade. A drop in solar panel prices globally since last year has spurred companies to embrace solar energy. \"The market is overrun with cheap but good panels from China. That means that the system that we are building now is about 20 per cent cheaper than a year ago,\" Matthias said. A German legislative package passed in April easing regulation and increasing subsidies for large rooftop systems as well as a pending tax investment reform for real estate funds operating rooftop solar panels, is expected to drive demand further. State feed-in subsidies for large scale rooftop photovoltaic projects, introduced in 2021 and which are selected via tender, have also boosted the trend. The last tender for the subsidised projects in February saw a 107 per cent rise in the number of offers year-on-year, data by the federal grid network agency showed. A feed-in tariff of 9.3 euros cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than Tridelta's power purchasing price, makes it currently cheaper for the company to sell future generated electricity to the grid and buy it back, Matthias said. Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on companies' electricity trading strategies. \"There's a high correlation between the feed-in tariffs and the build-up of solar PV roof top projects,\" Hugo Willink, Executive Director at solar roofs developer Sunrock told Reuters. Sunrock, which won an order from Mercedes Benz in May to build a 23-megawatt solar project on the carmaker's factory roofs, sees Germany as its core market for the coming year.",

India, which tops the buyers list of seaborne Russian oil cargoes since 2022, purchased more than 65% of Urals loading last month, according to Reuters calculations based on LSEG data. India also imports Russian oil grades other than Urals. The main Indian ports for Urals oil cargoes were Sikka, Vadinar, Mundra and Cochin, according to LSEG data. The ports accommodate oil imports for the main Indian oil refiners: Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy, Indian oil and BPCL. Turkey, which ramped up Urals oil purchases in May to an all-time record, imported slightly less in June, accounting for about 20% of Urals oil exports last month, Reuters calculations based on LSEG data showed. Urals oil cargoes are mostly destined for Turkey's Aliaga and Izmir, where Turkey's Tupras refineries and SOCAR's STAR refineries are situated. June-loading Urals oil deliveries to China were seen as minor, with just a couple of Urals cargoes going there, LSEG data showed. Urals oil supplies to China are low amid weak demand from local refineries, which suffer from weak margins and are not keen to pay up for the Russian grade, traders said. They also added costly freight from Russian western ports to China, also weighing on profitability of supplies, traders said. China remains a major buyer of Russia's Far East ESPO Blend oil grade and has recently increased buying of July-loading cargoes. About 15% of Urals oil cargoes loaded in June don't have a final destination, according to LSEG data. Most of them are likely to find home in India, traders said. India's demand for Russian Urals oil remains high, keeping prices in India's ports at a firm level.",

            "articleBody": "U.S-based short-seller Hindenburg Research said on Monday that India's securities regulator had sent it a letter outlining suspected violations over its short bet against Adani Group last year and revealed it may \"barely come out above breakeven\" on its trade.  Hindenburg also said Kotak Bank, an Indian firm, created and oversaw an offshore fund structure that was used by its \"investor partner\" to bet against the conglomerate, providing new details of trades that have puzzled investors. The short-seller said it made $4.1 million in gross revenue through \"gains related to Adani shorts from that investor relationship\" and just $31,000 through its short position of Adani's U.S. bonds. It did not name the investor. Characterizing the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) \"show cause\" notice as attempted intimidation, Hindenburg wrote that the regulator had made the \"nebulous allegation\" that Hindenburg's report contained misrepresentations and inaccurate statements meant to mislead readers. \"In our view, SEBI has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimized by it,\" Hindenburg said. SEBI, Adani Enterprises and Kotak did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside working hours.  SEBI has also been probing Adani, but India's top court has given it till August 14 to complete its investigation.  The disclosure of the SEBI notice adds a new twist in the saga unleashed last year when Hindenburg, founded by Nathan Anderson, alleged improper business dealings by Adani. The group, which refuted the allegations, suffered a loss of as much as $150 billion in combined market value after the report, but has since rebounded. Hindenburg's response also sheds some new light on the mechanics of its trade, the details of which had intrigued other investors because Indian securities rules make it hard for foreigners bet against companies there. \"It was a tiny position,\" it said. \"But, to date, our research on Adani is by far the work we are most proud of.\"",

            "articleBody": "London: A proposed strike next week at Tata Steel UK's sprawling Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales has been called off, unions said Monday, citing a resumption of talks with management. The Indian-owned giant plans to start shutting the first furnace at the UK's biggest steelworks soon and the second by the end of 2024 under the overhaul, as it transitions to greener production. The Unite trade union had announced in response that Tata staff would begin an indefinite strike from July 8 in protest over the job-slashing plans -- but this has now been suspended. Britain's main opposition Labour party, widely expected to beat the governing Conservatives in a general election on July 4, had urged Tata to avert the strike. \"Unite... has today confirmed that its current industrial action at Tata in South Wales has been paused,\" the union said in a statement on Monday. \"The decision follows confirmation from Tata, arising from high-level talks throughout the weekend, that it was now prepared to enter into negotiations about future investment for its operations and not just redundancies, in South Wales, including at Port Talbot.\" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham hailed a \"breakthrough\" over the matter. \"This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site.\"This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. \"Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste.\"The ovens, which had initially been planned to shutter from July, are used to turn coal into coke, a key raw material used in the steel-making process.Tata had revealed in January that it was planning to shut the coke ovens and two high-emission blast furnaces in Port Talbot, leading to the loss of up to 2,800 jobs.The overhaul comes with the European steel industry facing upheaval as it tries to finance less carbon-intensive production.Tata is seeking to invest &pound;1.25 billion ($1.58 billion), including &pound;500 million in UK government cash, into electric arc furnace technology to try to cut long-term carbon emissions.The company said it would not now bring forward plans to shut one of furnaces early because of the walk-out threat, and would revert to its initial plan for discussions with unions on \"future investments and aspirations for the business\".",

            "articleBody": "After the success of Pavagada Solar park in Tumakuru, the Karnataka government is planning to establish yet another solar park in the district, this time in Madhugiri taluk. The initiative was announced by Energy Minister K J George in Tumakuru. \"The upcoming project will not only scale up Karnataka's clean energy infrastructure, but also holds the potential to significantly enhance environmental stewardship and energy security in the state,\" he said. Madhugiri Solar Park will be developed in a strategic partnership with Tehri Hydro Development Corporation India Limited (THDCIL), owned by the central government. \"This partnership aims to leverage local expertise and resources to identify suitable land parcels essential for advancing Karnataka's renewable energy agenda, instilling confidence in the project's success,\" added George. The energy minister was visiting Tumakuru to review the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM KUSUM) project at the district commissioner's office. \"The subsidy for free electricity for farmers' pump sets is increasing annually. Despite efforts to regularise farmers' pump sets, the issue persists, leading to transformer damage and power supply disruptions due to illegal connections. In this context, we are prioritising the KUSUSM B and Kusum C projects, encouraging the adoption of solar pump sets,\" George added. Outlining the details of the Kusum C project, the minister said, \"To generate 1 MW of electricity under the Kusum C project, 4-5 acres of land are needed. If government land is used, it will be provided free of cost and leased for 25 years. Lessees will pay Rs. 25,000 per acre annually during the lease period. These funds will be deposited in the district collector's account and allocated to develop local anganwadis, schools, and panchayats.\" The PM KUSUM initiative, a joint effort of the central and the state governments, was launched to address farmers' energy needs and make agriculture more sustainable. Accelerating transformative energy security for Indian agriculture involves implementing comprehensive strategies to ensure reliable and sustainable energy sources for farmers, said Gaurav Gupta, additional chief secretary, energy department of Karnataka, during the review meeting. \"We will select land around substations for this initiative. So far, 27 substations have been chosen, with an additional 12 substations to be selected in the next phase for Tumakuru district. Work has already begun in some substations, and surveys have been conducted. The aim is to benefit farmers with locally generated electricity,\" added Gupta. The meeting was also attended by state Home Minister G Parameshwar, who is also the district in-charge minister, cooperation minister K N Rajanna, state government special representative in Delhi T B Jayachandra, MLA K Shadakshari, BESCOM managing director Mahantesh Bilagi and Tumakuru district collector Shubha Kalyan.",

According to the agreement signed in New Delhi, SGEL will provide around 4,500 MW of carbon-free energy from solar and wind sources to support AM Green&rsquo;s upcoming green ammonia facilities.This renewable energy will be integrated with pumped hydro storage by AM Green to ensure consistent power supply to its facilities. The agreement was formalized in the presence of senior officials including Sh. Akhileshwar Singh, Director of Finance at SJVN Ltd, and Sh. Ajay Kumar Singh, CEO of SGEL, among others.Under the phased project plan, SGEL aims to deliver the first 1,500 MW within two years, contributing to SJVN's broader goal to expand its renewable energy capacity to 25,000 MW by 2030 and 50,000 MW by 2040.AM Green, backed by the founders of Greenko Group, targets producing 5 million tonne per annum of green ammonia by 2030. This production capacity is poised to fulfill about one-fifth of India&rsquo;s target under the National Green Hydrogen Mission and 10 percent of Europe&rsquo;s target for green hydrogen imports by 2030.Mahesh Kolli, Founder, Greenko Group &amp; AM Green, commented on the deal, \"We are delighted to partner with SJVN on one of the world&rsquo;s largest carbon-free, renewable energy supply contracts. This partnership demonstrates AM Green&rsquo;s emerging leadership position as a global clean energy transition solutions platform while contributing to India&rsquo;s ambition of emerging as an exporter of reliable, sustainable and lowest-cost green molecules and its derivatives accelerating industrial decarbonisation globally.\"Ajay Singh, CEO, SJVN Green, said, \"We are elated to embark on this collaboration with AM Green, as it holds tremendous potential for accelerating the development of renewable assets in India. The project also marks SJVN&rsquo;s foray into supplying power to private sector entities. With our ambitious capacity addition targets, SJVN is actively pursuing opportunities across the spectrum and is keen to take forward this arrangement with AM Green.\"Additionally, AM Green has recently secured several strategic partnerships and investments, notably with Gentari Sdn Bhd and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, to bolster its position in the global green ammonia market. The company is on the brink of making a final investment decision for its first 2 MTPA green ammonia project early this year, advancing its competitive stance both in India and internationally.",

In anticipation of the monsoon, which typically impacts coal production, the coal ministry has proactively secured a stock of 98.67 million tonnes at the pithead of mines, including coal in transit as of 30th June 2024. This figure is 33.5% higher than last year's stock during the same period.Currently, the coal stock at TPPs fulfills 68% of the normative requirement, a significant increase from 50% around the same time last year. During the fiscal year 23-24, there was no reported scarcity of coal at these plants, with the stock at the end of March 2024 standing over 47 million tonne. The ministry aims to maintain a similar level of stock this fiscal year both at TPPs and at mine pitheads.Additionally, the increase in the number of rakes/days by 10.54% over last year ensures that adequate supplies will be maintained throughout the monsoon season. The ministries of coal, railways, and power are closely coordinating to ensure consistent coal availability for all domestic coal-based TPPs.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a significant move towards sustainable infrastructure development, Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Member (Science) of Niti Aayog, released new guidelines for the utilization of steel slag in road construction. This announcement was made at the First International Conference on Steel Slag Road, jointly organized by CSIR-CRRI and PHDCCI in New Delhi.The guidelines advocate for the processed use of steel slag aggregates in road construction, tapping into the waste from steel industries to foster environmental sustainability. According to Dr. Saraswat, the implementation of these guidelines is expected to yield substantial benefits, including cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced performance of roads.Highlighting the critical role of this initiative, Dr. Saraswat said, \"Adopting these guidelines for construction and maintenance of road network using steel slag is expected to bring numerous benefits, including cost saving, reduced environmental impact, and improved road performance.\" He linked the initiative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s \"Waste to Wealth\" vision, noting significant contributions by Dr. Manoranjan Parida, Director of CRRI, and Shri Satish Pandey, Principal Scientist.Shri Nagendra Nath Sinha, Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Steel, emphasized the research and development efforts leading to these guidelines. He noted, \"The Ministry of Steel sponsored a major R&amp;D project to CSIR-Central Road Research Institute to facilitate large-scale utilization of steel slag as a substitute for natural aggregates in road construction.\"The guidelines also detail a framework for the safe handling and storage of steel slag to prevent environmental contamination, reflecting a comprehensive approach to sustainable construction practices.Dr. N. Kalaiselvi, Secretary, DSIR and DG, CSIR, also supported the initiative, mentioning the Steel Slag Road between Mumbai and Goa as a landmark project underlining the efficacy and potential of this technology.The conference also saw participation from industry leaders who discussed the broader applications and environmental benefits of using steel slag in road construction. Mr. Ranjan Dhar of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India highlighted the success of India&rsquo;s First Steel Slag Road at Hazira, Surat, which used 100 thousand tonnes of processed steel slag and has received national and international recognition for its innovative approach.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd can add up to USD 100 billion to its market capitalisation in its fourth monetisation cycle this century as new cash flow streams emerge and valuation multiples catch up, Morgan Stanley said in a report. The oil-to-telecom conglomerate has seen monetisation cycles deliver 2-3x value creation for shareholders in the past nearly three decades, with each decade seeing USD 60 billion+ in market cap creation.  RIL is in its fourth monetisation cycle this century.  \"Monetisation 4.0 is different; it is supported by the business upcycle, domestic demand, and lower competition,\" the brokerage said. \"RIL's fourth monetisation cycle (since 1997) should add up to USD 100 billion to USD 60 billion increase in market cap year-to-date.\"  Key to this has been RIL's market share gains, complete integration, and most importantly, ability to execute above investor expectations each time the company has re-imagined its business.  This monetisation follows the USD 60 billion in investments in 2021-23, which was the shortest investment cycle since the 1990s for RIL.  Investments made in new energy, retail expansion to take market share from the unorganised sector, and repurposing existing energy businesses provide a long runway to deliver earnings growth consistently even beyond the next three years should ROCE be sustained above 10 per cent.  Morgan Stanley expected the company's earnings to grow at 12 per cent CAGR over FY24-26 with tailwinds in earnings from all verticals.  \"We see RIL's ROE being higher than the cost of capital going forward as it is transitioning to a more profitable, sustainable, and less cyclical growth model due to changes in business as well as capital structure,\" it said.  It raised its multiples (in SOTP) by 0.5-1.0x to reflect this monetisation as RIL catches up with domestic and global peers that have seen the business upcycle and monetisation re-rate multiples by 30 per cent in the past year.  On what has changed and what is priced in, the brokerage said, \"We reflect recent telecom tariff hikes, oil prices, and refining margins, and raise our EPS estimates fractionally for 2025, by 7 per cent for 2026, and by 8 per cent for 2027.\"  \"RIL has been a 'show me' story for the past decade and has seen significant market cap inflection once new revenue streams such as new energy, higher telecom tariffs/chemical margins have been delivered,\" it added.",

(Corporate Affairs &amp; Governance) at Toyota Kirloskar Motor, discussed the economic potential tied to the EV market. \"By 2037, we are set to be a $35 trillion economy if we keep growing at 7%. This growth will significantly increase the demand for transportation and mobility, with energy requirements for vehicles expected to quadruple by 2030,\" he explained.The event also witnessed the participation of international figures such as HE Mr Philip Green OAM, Australia&rsquo;s High Commissioner to India, who emphasized the green energy sector's role in strengthening the bilateral ties between Australia and India. \"We are delighted to have a strong Australian delegation here, possibly the largest foreign contingent at this conference, which underscores our commitment to this sector,\" Green said.The event, which runs until July 5, 2024, will also include various sessions and discussions aimed at advancing India's adoption of cleaner technologies and showcasing innovations in the international battery and energy storage sectors.",

The company's production increased by 13.8 million tonnes compared to the corresponding quarter of FY'24, with all seven producing subsidiaries registering positive growth, it said. CIL's supplies also rose by 6 per cent to 198.4 million tonnes during April-June 2024, with a significant increase in supplies to both power and non-power sectors, it added. The company's coal loading witnessed healthy growth, with an average of 367.2 rakes per day, a 10.3 per cent year-on-year increase, it said. Higher production and loading resulted in a substantial increase in coal inventory at CIL's pitheads, reaching 81.5 million tonnes, providing a sufficient buffer to meet any sudden surge in demand, it said. At a time when power demand in the country is surging, the miner stepped up its supplies to coal-fired plants, registering a 4 per cent growth to 160 million tonnes in Q1 FY'25, a year-on-year increase of 6 million tonnes. In the same period of FY 2024, CIL's off-take to thermal power plants stood at 154 million tonnes, the company said. Additionally, CIL's supplies to the non-power sector reached an all-time high of 38.4 million tonnes in Q1FY25, logging a 16 per cent growth. This sector had received 33 million tonnes in April-June 2023. The growth in June 2024 alone was 23 per cent at 13.4 million tonnes, the statement said.",

            "articleBody": "MOSCOW: Saudi Arabia's state oil producer Aramco left unchanged official selling prices (OSPs) for liquefied petroleum gas in July, while Algeria's Sonatrach raised OSPs for LPG by 11-18 per cent due to a rising demand from the Mediterranean region, traders said. Aramco's July OSP for propane was stable at $580 per metric ton , as well as for butane, at $565 per ton . Propane and butane are types of LPG with different boiling points. LPG is mainly used as a fuel for cars, heating and as a feedstock for other petrochemicals. Sonatrach raised its July OSP for propane by $55 per ton to $550 and increased it for butane by $75 per ton to $500 . Aramco's OSPs for LPG are used as a reference for contracts to supply the product from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region. Sonatrach's OSPs for LPG are used as benchmarks for the Mediterranean, Black Sea region and Turkey. ",

The gain from 52% in the same period last year lifted the coverage to a record high for a six-month period, the research centre said in a statement. Germany's electricity imports rose 21% during the period, while exports fell by 15.5%, it added. The new record in renewable energy use was driven in part by solar panels, which generated 12.8% more energy, accounting for 14.7% of gross electricity generation. That was after a record high in solar panel installations last year, the centre said. The data was calculated under European Union requirements that base the share on usage rather than on production, a method also adopted by the Berlin government for its climate target definitions, BDEW said.

            "articleBody": "Islamabad: Weeks after slashing the prices of fuel ahead of the Eid ul Adha festival, the cash-strapped Pakistan government on Monday sharply hiked their prices for the next fortnight as it began the new fiscal year. According to a notification, the prices of petrol and High-Speed Diesel (HSD) were raised by Rs 7.45 and Rs 9.56 per litre respectively on the first day of a tax-laden budget for 2024-25, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.  Last month, the government slashed the prices of petrol and HSD by Pakistani Rs 10.20 and Pakistani Rs 2.33 per litre respectively, ahead of Eid ul Adha.  The Ministry of Finance in a late-night announcement said the prices of petroleum products have seen an increasing trend in the international market during the last fortnight, the Dawn newspaper reported.  The increase in petroleum product prices has been made based on the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority's (Ogra) recommendations and with the prime minister's approval, The Express Tribune said.  The new ex-depot petrol price for July 1 to 15 would be Pakistani Rs 265.61 per litre compared to Rs 258.16 in the previous fortnight, up by 2.9 per cent, the Dawn reported.  However, petrol would be available for over Pakistani Rs 266 per litre in the retail market, it said.  On the other hand, the new ex-depot price of HSD is Pakistani Rs 277.45 per litre, or 3.6 per cent higher than the Pakistani Rs 267.89 over the past fortnight.  Hours before the price hike announcement, Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced on Sunday evening that the petroleum levy would not be increased. Although its ceiling had been increased to Pakistani Rs 70 per litre in the budget from Pakistani Rs 60 to create \"headroom\" for the future, the Dawn reported.  Officials said the prices of petrol and HSD had increased in the international market by about USD 4.4 and USD 5.5 per barrel, respectively, in the last fortnight, the report said.  Since May 1, the prices of both petrol and HSD have been going down mainly because of a slump in the international market. Petrol prices dropped by nearly Pakistani Rs 35 to about Pakistani Rs 259 per litre on April 30. Likewise, the HSD price came down by about Pakistani Rs 22 to Pakistani Rs 268 per litre in the second fortnight of April.  Finance Minister Aurangzeb on Sunday conceded that the people were stressed due to new taxes imposed in the budget after his revenue measures were criticised by almost everyone.  His comments came as President Asif Ali Zardari accorded his approval to tax-laden Finance Bill 2024 on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The bill would be effective from July 1, according to the press release by the President Secretariat.  Addressing a press conference, Aurangzeb said he understood that the salaried class was particularly experiencing financial strain from new taxes. He pledged to offer relief to salaried individuals once any financial respite becomes feasible.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India and Australia are looking at ways to increase cooperation in critical minerals and their processing besides battery production, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said on Monday. Both countries have signed an interim free trade agreement and are in negotiations to expand that into a comprehensive pact, he said.  \"We are looking at how we can integrate our (India and Australia) economies in terms of battery production, in terms of mineral production, in terms of mineral processing, in terms of vehicle production,\" the secretary said here at a conference on the roadmap for vehicle electrification.  He also said that the government has taken a series of steps to promote domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and strengthened the ecosystem around that like boosting charging infrastructure.  Speaking at the event, Australian High Commissioner to India Philip Green OAM said they have huge mineral and energy resources that can support 'make in India'.  Australia has strong reserves of critical minerals and is the largest producer of lithium and the second largest producer of cobalt in the world.  \"We want to make India able to get easier access to all of the critical minerals and other capabilities in our society that can help India's green transition, and the only way we can achieve that is by a full free trade agreement,\" he said.  Critical minerals such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements are essential components in many of today's rapidly growing clean energy technologies - from wind turbines and electricity networks to electric vehicles.  Demand for these minerals is growing quickly with clean energy transitions gathering pace.  Barthwal added that like Australia, India has signed a trade pact with the four-nation European bloc EFTA and Norway is a key member of that grouping.  \"Norway has done extremely well in terms of the renewable energy sector...and we are collaborating with Norway. Similarly, we are collaborating with the European Union.  \"We have a technology group where we are looking at different technologies in battery making, in vehicle making, in mineral processing, in critical technologies,\" he said, adding, this is the time when each and everyone in the globe has to join hands together because this energy transition requirements and the commitment to reduce carbon emissions is for everybody.  Talking about huge opportunities in the EV sector in India, Barthwal said that the sale of EVs is increasing at a faster pace in the country and that requires a whole ecosystem not only EV manufacturing, but also battery making and charging ecosystem.  \"A whole gamut of activities is going to open up through the energy transition in the country and there is a lot to do both by the government and the private sector and therefore great opportunity is coming to investors to invest in this whole value chain,\" the secretary said.  The government, he said, is focusing on the whole chain, including the production of minerals.  The mines ministry is looking at resources in India as well as in the global supply chain.  \"We understand that this is a sector which is upcoming, and there are disabilities and constraints and therefore we are looking at how to provide a system of a level playing field, a system of incentives so that the sector grows in India,\" Barthwal said.  At present, around 1.7 million EVs have been sold in the country.  The government has rolled out schemes like Faster Adoption &amp; Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) and production linked incentive scheme for the sector.  \"We are looking at the whole gamut of value chain so that disabilities of manufacturers can be removed,\" he said.  The Centre, he said, is also talking with states to promote ease of doing business for the sector and on land availability for production and manufacturing.  \"We are trying to create an ecosystem whereby investments can be encouraged...close to USD 500 billion of potential exists. So I think it's a huge opportunity,\" he added.",

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: China's latest monthly power report excluded data on usage rates by generation source, after recent data showed declining utilisation at renewable power plants, a trend that was expected to continue. In a monthly data release on Friday, China's energy administration published only the average operating hours of all types of power plants for January to May. Previous data releases had broken down the statistics by generation source, including hydro, thermal, nuclear, wind, and solar generation. Usage rates for wind and solar had been expected to drop further after the government relaxed rules on renewable power utilisation in May. The report did not give a reason for the change and China's energy administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The previous month's data release - which captured January-April and was the last to include the detailed statistics - showed that solar and wind plant utilisation fell while hydro and thermal plant utilisation increased. In the first four months of the year, the average operating hours of wind and solar power plants dropped by 77 hours and 42 hours to 789 and 373 hours, respectively. Hydro plant operating hours rose by 48 hours to 783 hours on average and thermal power plants rose by 23 hours to 1,448 hours, respectively. China's cabinet said in a CO2 action plan on May 29 that it would increase the limit on renewable power curtailment from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, while also accelerating plans to build ultra-high voltage transmission lines. Curtailment is when grid managers stop a certain amount of supply coming onto the grid to maintain balances with demand. The previous limit of 5 per cent was in line with rates of 1.5-4 per cent in most big markets, according to the International Energy Agency. The change is expected to allow more renewable capacity to be built, but at lower utilisation rates. Average utilisation hours of all power generators surveyed were 1,372 during the first five months of the year, 59 hours lower than in the same period of 2023, according to the energy bureau data on Friday. Last August, China suspended the release of youth unemployment data, which had hit record highs, before resuming the reports in January with a new methodology that excludes students.",

This trend is followed by electric three-wheelers and small trucks, with electric cars projected to capture about 10 per cent of the total market, influenced by evolving charging infrastructure and consumer price sensitivity.In terms of sales volume, Tata Motors led the market in 2023, selling 53,199 units. It was followed by SAIC with 12,562 units and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra with 8,286 units. Popular models included the Tata Nexon BEV, Tata Tigor/Tiago BEV, and the Mahindra XUV400 BEV.Despite the current growth, the development of charging infrastructure remains a challenge, with the pace described as slow but expected to accelerate to meet increasing demand. The report highlights that global manufacturers like Renault-Nissan and Stellantis are investing in Indian production facilities to capitalize on the low-cost manufacturing environment for potential exports.Government initiatives have significantly contributed to the market's growth, with schemes like Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) and various state-level incentives supporting the transition to electric mobility. The Indian government's ambitious targets aim for electric vehicles to comprise 30 per cent of private car sales, 70 per cent of commercial vehicle sales, and 80 per cent of two- and three-wheeler sales by 2030.Challenges such as the high cost of acquisition and the need for longer-range EV models continue to impede faster adoption rates. However, the government's focus on reducing import dependence through localized manufacturing and policy support for technologies like battery swapping is expected to mitigate these barriers.The report underscores the promising future of the Indian EV market, driven by robust government support, advancing technology, and a growing consumer base eager for sustainable transportation solutions.",

            "articleBody": "MOSCOW: Top Russian oil producer Rosneft has appointed a new head of Vostok Oil, a flagship project where Russia expects to produce and export as much as 2 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030. Rosneft named Andrei Lazeyev, former boss of Rosneft firm Bashneft, to lead Vostok Oil, data from the state registry showed. He will replace Vladimir Chernov as they swap places. Chernov was appointed to lead Bashneft last month. The change in management is aimed at spurring faster development at the oilfields, the Kommersant newspaper reported last month. Lazeyev, who worked at Russo-British oil producer TNK-BP, moved to Rosneft as chief geologist in 2013 following its acquisition of TNK-BP. He joined the management board of Rosneft in 2022 and took the reins at Bashneft, the Kommersant reported. Expected output from Vostok Oil if realised would match that of the entire North Sea oil market which is between some 1.8 million and 2 million bpd. It would also be on a par with production realised at the Samotlor West Siberian oilfield in the 1970s and 1980s. Vostok Oil's loading terminal, the Bukhta Sever, in the Yenisei Bay on the Taymyr Peninsula is expected to handle 600,000 bpd when finished this year, or around 15% of Russia's total and equal to current loadings from Primorsk, Russia's largest Baltic sea port.

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: Iron ore futures prices rose on Monday, helped by better-than-expected factory data in top consumer China and hopes of more stimulus measures in the world's second-largest economy later this month. The most-traded September iron ore contract on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) traded 1.2 per cent higher at 829 yuan ($114.06) a metric ton, as of 0304 GMT. The benchmark August iron ore on the Singapore Exchange was nearly 0.6 per cent higher at $107.2 a ton. The Caixin/S&amp;P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.8 in June from 51.7 in the previous month, marking the fastest clip since May 2021 and surpassing analysts' forecasts of 51.2. The official manufacturing PMI was unchanged from May at 49.5 in June, data showed on Sunday, below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and in line with a median forecast of 49.5 in a Reuters poll. The expectation that hot metal output will fall significantly receded after the latest property stimulus in Beijing, analysts at Jinrui Futures said in a note. China's capital city Beijing unveiled last week measures to reduce the cost of buying a home by cutting mortgage interest rates and the minimum down payment ratio. Additionally, some investors and traders are bearing hopes for possibly more stimulus from the long-delayed third plenum to be held from July 15 to July 18. Other steelmaking ingredients on the DCE gained ground, with coking coal and coke up 1.9 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively. Steel benchmarks on the Shanghai Futures Exchange posted marginal gains. Rebar ticked 0.3 per cent higher, hot-rolled coil advanced 0.4 per cent, wire rod edged up 0.1 per cent and stainless steel added 0.5 per cent. \"The room for a further fall in steel prices in the second half of the year is limited as the valuation has already stayed at a relatively low level and many mills are suffering loss,\" Everbright Futures said in a note.",

            "articleBody": "MELBOURNE: Indonesia's Delta Dunia Group plans to grow through acquisitions, backed by strong support from its lenders, after it completed the $122.4 million purchase of Atlantic Carbon Group on Monday, director Iwan Salim said. The Jakarta-listed company has been diversifying beyond its home base of Indonesia where it runs its BUMA coal mining services business. It bought Australia's Downer coal mining contractor business for A$139 million ($92.63 million) in 2021 and has now expanded into US markets and mining anthracite coal, used to make steel. Its latest deal has secured ownership of four producing anthracite mines in Pennsylvania, which will help Delta Dunia to lower its revenue from thermal coal to below 50 per cent of its total revenue by 2028. \"We are going to use this very positive momentum going forward,\" Salim told Reuters. \"We have a lot of support from our bankers if the growth opportunity is correct.\" The activity comes as major financial institutions have shied away from lending to fossil fuel companies given climate change concerns. Salim did not specify acquisition targets, timelines or the spending plans on them. For Delta, the latest transaction and its growth plans are supported by a cash position of $322 million as of end June and a $750 million syndicated loan facility with PT Bank BNI (Persero) Tbk and PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk. It has also received support from several Shariah compliant banks, Indonesian and US bond holders in the past year given Delta Dunia's strong track record for repayments, he said. The diversified mining services provider is looking at Australia, where Anglo American is set to sell its coking coal mines, for growth, as well as at other jurisdictions, Salim said. \"We will look at opportunities as they arise,\" he said. \"Australia, because we're already there with Buma Australia, the contracting business, is something we actively look at.\" \"But with the American acquisition, you can see that our outward radar is not just on Australia.\" The door is not closed on buys into mines producing other metals such as lithium or copper, but for now it plans to focus on what it knows best, which is coal, and mining services, he said.

            "articleBody": "Lubumbashi: In the boiling sun, Mifie and her neighbours work hard to grow vegetables in fields at the edge of a Congolese river which campaigners say has long been polluted by a copper and cobalt mine.\"We cannot live properly with this polluted water,\" the pregnant 23-year-old said among the cabbages, amaranth and other vegetables at her plot in DR Congo's southeastern mining region.Irrigation channels from the Luano river can be seen weaving paths through fields to bring water to feed the crops.  But acidity in the water hampers agricultural production and causes health problems such as skin and eye complaints, villagers say. The Democratic Republic of Congo is Africa's top producer of copper, vital for energy storage, electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines. It is also the world's largest producer of cobalt -- a key component of batteries used in electronics and electric vehicles. For more than 100 years, an abundance of mineral wealth has driven economic activity in the vast country's second biggest city, Lubumbashi.But the mines also produce water, air and ground pollution, NGOs say, demanding tighter regulation of the sector. Lying on the outskirts of the city, the Luano river is the main discharge point for wastewater from the nearby Ruashi mine, three NGOs said in a report in 2021.Environmental charity PremiCongo, Afrewatch, which campaigns for fair use of natural resources, and ACIDH human rights group conducted a study among people living near the large open cast mine operated by Ruashi Mining.Chinese company Jinchuan Group owns a 75-percent share in Ruashi Mining, while Congolese business Gecamines owns the rest.\"The three communities are some of the poorest people in Lubumbashi,\" Christian Bwenda, PremiCongo coordinator, told AFP.- 'Sore eyes' - Crops do not grow in the acidic earth as they used to, say the farmers, who resort to buying fertilisers.Mifie, who declined to give her full name, earns 200,000 Congolese francs ($70) a month.But a packet of fertiliser costs 2,500 Congolese francs (about 90 cents) and sometimes she buys as many as five a day. \"I work a lot to earn a little. I don't have enough income,\" said another farmer Emmie Kasungo, standing with her three daughters in tall stalks of corn. Strawberry farmer Celestin, who also declined to give his full name, does not use fertilisers as customers want organic fruit. \"People prefer to not consume strawberries with polluted water,\" he also said. But standing in knee-high wellington boots, he told AFP that he had suffered skin problems which he blamed on water from the Luano river.\"When I was working without boots, I had some sores. It hurt,\" he said.Teacher Ngoy Therese, 58, says around 60 percent of the children she sees have health issues related to the water in the area and dust from the mine.\"We have people with sore eyes,\" she told AFP.Local activist Christophe Kabwita pointed to marks on his skin which he believes come from mining pollution. Around the mine \"new illness\" has appeared that was not there before, he said.- 'Avoid the water' - Lubumbashi University professor Arthur Kaniki, who also helps run its environmental analysis laboratory, has carried out studies of rivers near mining sites in Upper Katanga province where Lubumbashi is the main city. He said water near many mines often shows a \"state of pollution\" and, in some rivers, an \"elevated concentration\" of copper and cobalt. Pollution from the \"presence of solid matter\" is \"generated from mining\", he said.\"This risks contaminating the food chain, it's an enormous risk for the health of the population,\" Kaniki told AFP. \"We have asked the population to avoid using this water, especially for direct consumption or for watering (plants).\"Sediment collected from the village of Luano shows that the water is acidic, while tests of the Luano river show the same, the 2021 study said. \"The problem of pollution always exists where there are areas of mines,\" Georges Mawine, former mines minister for Upper Katanga, told AFP.In response to AFP requests for comment, Ruashi Mining said it conducted environmental monitoring but gave no information on the results.\"We have an environmental department that regularly takes water and air samples,\" Elisa Kalasa, social and community head of department for Ruashi Mining, told AFP in an email.\"Ruashi Mining has improved water for the community in partnership with (water company) Regideso,\" she added, without giving details.But for Bwenda, the solution is simple.\"The company must take all measures possible so that the negative impacts on the life of people are reduced as much as possible,\" he said.",

            "articleBody": "SINGAPORE: China is setting up a new entity that groups national oil producers and other state firms to search for ultra-deep oil and gas reserves and tackle harder-to-extract non-conventional resources, state energy group CNPC said on Monday. This is in answer to President Xi Jinping's call for the sector to have \"new productive forces\" that will contribute to the country's energy security, CNPC said on its website. In addition to CNPC and Sinopec, the country's two dominant producers of oil and gas, the new body gathers seven other state groups including China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, steel group Baowu, equipment builder Sinomach, Dongfang Electric Group and Minmetals. \"This...is to gather wisdom and strength to jointly build an industry chain from ultra-deep oil and gas exploration to development to engineering,\" CNPC said. The group will drill conventional resources at ultra-deep wells that extend as much as 10,000 meters (6.21 miles) below the surface in places like northwest Xinjiang's Tarim basin region where CNPC and Sinopec are major players. It will also seek to tap deep shale oil and coal-seam gas resources. China is the world's largest crude oil importer and relies on imports for nearly three-quarters of its needs. It has been investing billions of dollars to maintain its domestic crude oil production at above 4 million barrels a day, a level seen as necessary to power manufacturing activities and military services. Years of effort by state oil majors to drill deeper onshore and accelerate development at offshore oilfields have yielded output growth of 2 per cent per year since 2018. That said, state firms have to contend with declining output at large mature fields. They are also grappling with the geological and cost challenges of extracting shale oil and gas resources.",

            "articleBody": "In South Korea, Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp.&rsquo;s moves toward electrification are provoking similar anxieties in that country&rsquo;s highly active and organized labor movement.The threat to jobs caused by the electric vehicle transition isn&rsquo;t just a hot-button issue in the US, where a presidential election campaign is in full swing.In Japan, the heads of Toyota Motor Corp., the country&rsquo;s largest employer with close to 381,000 staff, are grappling with how the carmaker&rsquo;s technological transformation will impact not only its workers but the nation&rsquo;s vast auto supply chain and the thousands of jobs it supports.In South Korea, Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp.&rsquo;s moves toward electrification are provoking similar anxieties in that country&rsquo;s highly active and organized labor movement. Hyperdrive sat down in Seoul last week with officials from the Korean Metal Workers&rsquo; Union, which represents roughly 180,000 auto workers, including about 70,000 at Hyundai and Kia, the country&rsquo;s two dominant manufacturers. The union, formed in 2001, is in the process of negotiating a new annual contract for Hyundai&rsquo;s vehicle assembly workers and it&rsquo;s threatened to strike over disagreements on future hiring plans and sharing the spoils of Hyundai&rsquo;s record profits in 2023.The conflict has clear echoes of the contentious six-week strike between the United Auto Workers union and the Detroit Three carmakers last fall.Last week was also the week that at least 23 people, mostly migrant workers from China, died in a fire caused by explosions at a lithium battery plant south of Seoul. The fire, at a factory owned by Aricell, which makes products for industrial and military applications, was the worst accident at a battery plant in the country&rsquo;s history. In response, the government has formed a task force to improve fire safety measures across the industry.We asked union officials including policy secretary Kim Sang Min and executive director of international, Hyewon Chong, how they&rsquo;re dealing with challenges like job losses due to electrification and automation, as well as safety risks as EV battery production expands. The conversation, which was both in Korean and English, has been edited for length and clarity.We have to overhaul safety management systems in light of the incredible risks. If a company is going to bring in temporary, outsourced workers, they have to have a safety management system in place for these people. Aricell is a subsidiary of S-Connect and there was an outsourced recruitment firm for the factory workers. This kind of system hinders workers from connecting with each other and helps employers control them more easily. We&rsquo;re trying to respond to this trend. Hyundai is pushing electrification, building EV plants in South Korea and the US, and a new heavily automated facility in Singapore. What does this mean for your members?The visit to Hyundai&rsquo;s plant in Singapore made us realize that it will be hard to keep our jobs. So we&rsquo;re trying to demand that companies create new jobs related to green industries. It&rsquo;s something we really think about deeply and study what kind of demands will really make a difference. We need to confess, we don&rsquo;t have a magic bullet.Dealing with this only at the factory level would be insufficient to address what&rsquo;s going on in society. If we limit our sights to inside the factory walls, it looks like jobs are being reduced. On the other hand, there are also workers who are going to be building robots.So what does that look like in practice?We signed an agreement on industrial transformation with Korean metal industry employers in 2021. This year we&rsquo;re focusing on supply chains, a plan called &ldquo;just transition,&rdquo; where automakers are taking overall responsibility for realizing carbon neutrality in their supply chains.We have to develop clusters and strategies for different regions for different sub-sectors. A consultation framework should be made so that the local community and the companies and the trade unions will be able to find strategies to realign their economic production on something that&rsquo;s needed, something that will continue employment in a sustainable way.South Korea&rsquo;s working population is shrinking as post-war baby boomers retire, and companies are increasingly hiring migrant workers. How do you communicate with this new generation?We publish newsletters in various languages to deliver information they need to know, such as how to calculate Korean base salaries. Removing discrimination against migrant workers is one of our three main issues we plan to negotiate with companies this year. We also try to help them standardize their labor agreements, as migrant workers sometimes need special clauses such as ways to improve their living conditions at accommodations. And is Gen-Z interested in joining the union? In one of your newsletters, a union member said young people these days have &ldquo;a weaker willingness for fighting&rdquo; against management.Gen-Zs and millennials still account for a very small portion of the population at metal workers&rsquo; unions and the average age of unionized workers is rising. So, it&rsquo;s true that the demographic trend makes younger people raise their voices less than older generations do. There are views, which are a bit prejudiced, that younger generations don&rsquo;t have much interest in labor disputes and they tend to focus on their own interests. But we see some newly created unions by younger workers and they are showing actions that we didn&rsquo;t see previously, such as scuffling with gatekeepers at plants. They&rsquo;re trying to do something different from the older generation.",

JSW Group had failed to emerge as the winning bidder in the last tendering round, where Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ) had emerged as the L1 bidder in October 2022, and a Letter of Intent to Award (LOIA) was handed over to the company. However, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's announcement at the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS) in November 2023 that a tender would soon be launched for the development of the port. This has led to a cloud of uncertainty around the mega deep-sea port project.  JSW Infrastructure seals deal; to buy Navkar CorporationJSW Infra has finalized an agreement to purchase all shares held by the promoters of Mumbai's Navkar Corporation, which operates in the container handling sector, according to a disclosure to the stock exchange. Navkar Corporation offers a range of complementary products to the ports owned and managed by the Sajjan Jindal-group company. JSW Infra will pay Rs. 1,013 crore in cash for the stake acquired from Navkar Corporation's promoters.See More DetailsBanerjee had announced that the proposed deep-sea port at Tajpur is ready for tender, which would attract an investment of USD 3 billion or Rs 25,000 crore. JSW Infrastructure Joint Managing Director and CEO Arun Maheswari told PTI: \"We will re-evaluate our strategies. Previously, when we bid, it was 2-3 years back.\" He was in Kolkata to attend a CII Young Indians event. Since the chief minister's announcement, there has been no official word on the next steps, though Adani officials said they were in touch with the state administration. \"There has been no official clarification since the CM's announcement. However, we remain committed to the project and are still waiting for an award,\" Adani group sources said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The Tajpur deep sea port project is a challenging one, and the state government needs to be forthcoming to make the project a reality, sources said.  Udupi Cochin Shipyard Limited bags Rs 1,100 crore order for cargo vessels from Norwegian firmUCSL secured a Rs 1,100 crore deal for eight 6300 TDW cargo vessels from Wilson ASA. These vessels, designed for eco-friendly operation in European coastal waters, are part of a project to be completed by September 2028. The company has also delivered tugs to Adani Harbour Services and received repeat orders from Polestar Maritime.See More DetailsAPSEZ is the country's largest private port operator with an installed capacity of about 550 million tonnes per annum, while JSW Infra is also a major player boasting an installed cargo handling capacity of 170 million tonnes per annum. The proposed port's main features include a location five km from NH-116B and around 170 km from Kolkata. The port will have a deep draft of 12.1m, an 18-km channel, and tidal support of 3.9m, enabling large capesize vessels of one lakh DWT. The project is expected to entail an investment of Rs 15,000 crore, with an additional Rs 10,000 crore for related port-led infrastructure development, totalling Rs 25,000 crore. It is expected to create around 25,000 direct jobs and over one lakh indirect jobs. The Tajpur deep sea port was touted to usher in a new era of growth in the state, extending its benefits to the hinterland areas. As a deep sea greenfield port, its linkage to the Industrial and Economic Corridor from Dunkuni to Raghunathpur, being developed by the state, will enhance regional logistics and export efficiency, unlocking vast industrial and economic opportunities once operational, the state had said in the past.",

Efforts are also underway to increase its production for industrial purposes. Moreover, ongoing research has paved the way for the potential applications of activated carbon in water purification and sensor development, underscoring its vast potential in sustainable energy storage and beyond, the release further said. The successful development of coconut husk-derived activated carbon by the research team marks a significant breakthrough in the field of energy storage, it said. Utilising an advanced microwave pyrolysis reactor, the team was able to produce high-quality carbon in a mere five minutes, eliminating impurities like ash and generating zero waste. The device's high-power output, capable of powering two LEDs for 20 minutes, surpasses existing research by four times, paving the way for commercial energy storage applications, according to the release. This achievement showcases the potential of coconut husk-derived activated carbon to revolutionise the energy storage landscape, enabling sustainable and efficient energy solutions. The team's innovative approach and results have far-reaching implications, positioning this technology at the forefront of the quest for reliable and eco-friendly energy storage solutions. CCIF, funded by the Government of Kerala, is the first of its kind in the state and is equipped with world-class state-of-the-art facilities, including advanced instruments like NMR spectrometer, BET analyzer, fluorimeter, Electrochemical workstation, and PCR machines. With a vision to foster collaborative research and innovation, CCIF provides access to these world-class facilities at a reasonable service charge, ensuring that researchers from diverse institutions can leverage its capabilities. The facility has already catered to the needs of researchers from more than 50 colleges, six universities, and six national institutes, the release added.",

Saudi Arabia is working on developing its unconventional gas reserves, which require advanced extraction methods such as those used in the shale gas industry. Jafurah is the kingdom's largest unconventional non-oil associated gas field and is potentially the biggest shale gas development outside the United States, with reserves reaching 229 trillion cubic feet of gas and 75 billion barrels of condensates. \"By generating an anticipated 2 billion standard cubic feet per day of sales gas by 2030, this bold initiative will strengthen Saudi Arabia's position as one of the top national gas producers in the world\", said Nasser, speaking of the Jafurah field at a contracts award ceremony in Dhahran. The main gas network expansion will add 4,000 more kilometers of pipelines, boosting capacity by around 3.2 billion standard cubic feet per day and connecting several additional cities from across the country to the network, he said. Companies awarded contracts for the expansion in Jafurah included a consortium involving Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, while Chinese state energy giant Sinopec figured among the firms involved in the main gas network expansion.

SK Group also said it plans to secure 80 trillion won by 2026 to invest in artificial intelligence and semiconductors as well as fund shareholder returns, while streamlining its more than 175 subsidiaries. The sprawling conglomerate outlined the plans following a two-day strategy meeting, aiming to revive the group after SK Hynix, its main money maker, and the group's electric vehicle battery arm suffered heavy losses.  SK Group said it sought to improve its competitiveness by focusing on its AI value chain, including high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, AI data centres and AI services such as personalised AI assistants. At a time of transition, a \"preemptive and fundamental change is necessary,\" SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won was quoted as saying in the statement During the meeting, the executives also agreed to take gradual steps to adjust the number of subsidiaries in the group to a \"manageable range\", without specifying the scale of the reduction. Local media had said SK Innovation, which owns the county's largest oil refiner and battery maker SK On, was expected to pursue a merger with profitable gas affiliate SK E&amp;S.  The group expects its profit before tax to reach around 22 trillion won this year, turning around from a loss last year, with the goal of hitting 40 trillion won in profit before tax by 2026. South Korea, home to the world's top memory chip makers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, has fallen behind some rivals in areas such as chip design and contract chip manufacturing. Earlier this year, the government announced a 26 trillion won ($19 billion) support package for its chip businesses, citing a need to keep up in areas like chip design and contract manufacturing amid 'all-out warfare' in the global semiconductor market.",

            "articleBody": "LAUNCESTON: Asia's imports of crude oil ticked lower in the first half of 2024 from the same period last year, defying expectations that the top-consuming continent would lead global demand growth. Asia imported 27.16 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in the January to June period, down a modest 130,000 bpd from the 27.29 million bpd in the same period in 2023, according to data compiled by LSEG Oil Research. The slightly weaker outcome was largely a result of lower arrivals in China, the world's biggest oil importer, with gains by Asia's number two buyer India not enough to offset China's softness. The lack of growth in Asia's imports of crude oil in the first half goes some way to undermining the 2024 demand forecasts from major industry groups such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Of course, imports are only one component of overall demand, others including domestic oil production and changes in inventory levels. But in Asia, imports are the key driver of demand given the region's reliance on oil arriving in tankers, or via pipelines from Russia and central Asia in the case of China. For the demand forecasts made by the IEA and OPEC, it's certain that Asia's imports are going to have to be strong in the second half, especially those for China. OPEC's June monthly oil market report forecast that China's oil demand would grow by 720,000 bpd in 2024 over 2023, while the IEA is expecting an expansion of 500,000 bpd. However, China's imports were about 11.08 million bpd in the first half, a figure calculated by using official customs data for the first five months and LSEG's forecast for June. This is down 300,000 bpd from the customs number of 11.38 million bpd for the first six months of 2023. With China's imports looking weak, it's worth looking at whether domestic output is making up the difference. Domestic production was 4.28 million bpd in the first five months of the year, up 1.8% or about 140,000 bpd from the same period in 2023. In other words, the rise in domestic output is just less than half of the loss in crude oil imports.  INDIA'S DIM LIGHT If there is a somewhat brighter light in Asia, it's India, where crude imports were about 4.94 million bpd in the first half of 2024, according to calculations based on official and LSEG data. This is up about 90,000 bpd from the official figure of 4.85 million bpd for the first half of 2023. However, this relatively small gain in India's imports looks less impressive when the economic growth rate of 7.8% year-on-year in the first quarter is taken into account. It's also running at a rate below the OPEC forecast for India's demand to increase by 230,000 bpd for the whole of 2024, meaning that for the exporter group's estimate to be accurate, a strong second half will be needed. Overall, OPEC is expecting Asia's crude demand to rise by 1.3 million bpd in 2024 from the previous year, consisting of 720,000 bpd for China, 230,000 bpd for India and 350,000 bpd for the rest of the continent. The IEA expects Asia's demand to lift by 900,000 bpd in 2024, made up of 500,000 bpd in China and 400,000 bpd for the rest of the continent. But with imports actually dropping in the first half by 130,000, it leaves a mountain to climb in the second half. The question for the markets is whether there is confidence that China's economy will rebound in the second half, and that the rest of Asia will enjoy stronger economic growth as well. If the assumption is that OPEC and its allies in the broader OPEC+ group are successful in keeping oil prices above $80 a barrel, then it follows that only robust economic growth will lead to higher demand for crude.",

            "articleBody": "Bengaluru: Researchers at the Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, Indian Institute of Science, have developed an enzymatic platform that can efficiently transform naturally abundant and inexpensive fatty acids to valuable hydrocarbons called 1-alkenes, which are promising biofuels. Given the finite availability and polluting nature of fossil fuels, scientists are increasingly exploring sustainable fuel pathways that involve compounds called hydrocarbons. They show great potential as \"drop-in\" biofuels, which can be blended and used with existing fuels and infrastructure, according to Bengaluru-based IISc. These hydrocarbons can potentially be synthesised on a large scale using microorganism \"factories\". Enzymes that help mass-produce these hydrocarbons are therefore highly sought after. Hydrocarbons are also widely used in polymer, detergent and lubricant industries, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) noted in a press release. In a previous study, the IISc team purified and characterised an enzyme called UndB, bound to the membranes of living cells, especially certain bacteria. It can convert fatty acids to 1-alkenes at the fastest rate currently possible. But the team found that the process was not very efficient 'the enzyme would become inactivated after just a few cycles.  When they investigated further, they realised that H2O2 'a byproduct of the reaction process' was inhibiting UndB. In the current study published in \"Science Advances\", the team circumvented this challenge by adding another enzyme called catalase to the reaction mix. \"The catalase degrades the H2O2 that is produced,\" explains Tabish Iqbal, first author of the study and PhD student at IPC. Adding catalase, he says, enhanced the activity of the enzyme 19-fold, from 14 to 265 turnovers (turnover indicates the number of active cycles an enzyme completes before getting inactivated).  Excited by this finding, the team decided to create an artificial fusion protein combining UndB with catalase, by introducing a fused genetic code via carriers called plasmids into E.coli bacteria. Given the right conditions, these E.coli would then act as a \"whole cell biocatalyst\", converting fatty acids and churning out alkenes, the release said. However, there were several challenges. Being a membrane protein, UndB is extremely challenging to work with. Beyond a certain concentration, it can be toxic to bacterial cells. Membrane proteins like UndB are also not soluble in water, making it hard to maintain the right conditions for studying them, it was noted.  To improve the efficiency of their chimeric protein, the team tested the effect of various \"redox partner\" proteins that help shuttle electrons to UndB during the conversion of fatty acids to alkenes. They found that proteins called ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, along with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), were able to supply electrons most efficiently. On incorporating these in the genetically modified E.coli and feeding fatty acids, the efficiency of conversion rose up to 95 per cent. A key advantage of this biocatalyst is that UndB is very specific and does not produce any unwanted side products 'pure 1-alkene is the only product, says Debasis Das, Assistant Professor at IPC and corresponding author. \"1-alkenes can directly be used as biofuels,\" he adds. The team found that their biocatalyst could convert a wide range of fatty acids containing different types of carbon chains to 1-alkene. They also showed that the biocatalyst can produce styrene, an important commodity in chemical and polymer industries. The team has applied for a patent for their engineered protein and whole cell biocatalyst. They are also looking for industry collaborators to scale up the platform for mass production. \"Our platform can be efficiently used to generate a large number of 1-alkenes that are valuable in biotechnology and polymer industries,\" says Das.",

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd's (MSEDCL) 6,600 MW tender for long-term power procurement has come under the security of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). In response to an application filed by the state power utility MSEDCL to seek approval for deviation in the standard bidding documents, the MERC has questioned the state power utility why the approval was not sought before initiating the bidding process, according to the regulator's June 25 order. The state power regulator has directed the MSEDCL to demonstrate in quantifiable terms how the proposed deviations in the bidding documents are in the consumers' interest. MSEDCL in March issued a tender to procure 1,600 MW thermal power and 5,000 MW of solar power in Maharashtra. This was just before the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha elections kicked in. The power procurement was for meeting the demand for 2033-34, i.e. 10 years from now. The MERC in its order asked MSEDCL to clarify that as the proposed power procurement being undertaken to meet the demand of 2033-34 will start commissioning in the next 2 to 4 years, so would such early contracting create any stranded capacity. The MERC also wanted to know whether the Maharashtra state power utility has tied up sufficient power to meet the projected demand before 2033-34, according to the order. The MERC asked the MSEDCL to explain the rationale for considering combined power procurement of solar and thermal from a single entity. The Commission wants to know if all future thermal power procurements would follow the same principle. According to the sources, MSEDCL is trying to conclude the tender submission in July, before the code of conduct is issued for the state elections, which are due in October 2024. According to an industry source, projects of this scale would require an investment of around Rs 40,000 crore. Any interested party that wants to participate in the tender will have to obtain offers from equipment suppliers, tie up financing and also arrange for other project essentials such as land, water and transmission. The tender does not afford sufficient time for the interested parties to arrange for these basic requirements, they said adding this may lead to restricted participation, which is not in the consumer's interest and might result in higher cost of power procurement and tariffs. Allowing sufficient time for wider participation in the tender will always be in the interest of consumers, since the power requirement is starting in 2033, the source further added. MSEDCL has been given 7 days to file submission on the queries raised by the MERC. The next date of hearing is on July 2, 2024.",

            "articleBody": "Ola CEO Bhavish AggarwalIndia's Ola Electric is working to build solid-state batteries and expects its vehicles to be powered by its own cells next year, the founder and chairman of the SoftBank Group-backed electric scooter maker said on Saturday. \"We are in very early stages of our experimentation on solid state batteries,\" said chairman Bhavish Aggarwal. Aggarwal said he expects Ola's own cells to power its electric scooters, among India's most-sold, by early next year, when commercial production begins at its cell 'gigafactory' in Southern Tamil Nadu state. The factory, owned by a unit of Ola Electric, has been selected for the government's battery manufacturing incentive scheme. Solid-state batteries are expected to offer improved safety, a longer lifespan and faster charging compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries that use flammable liquid electrolytes. But mass adoption has proved difficult due to constraints in raw material availability, intricate manufacturing processes and the resultant high costs. Japan's Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker, is a big proponent of solid-state batteries and expects to launch them globally in the next few years. Ola does not currently produce its own cells but sources them from South Korea's LG Energy Solution and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology. Localising cell manufacturing is seen as a key step in bringing down upfront costs of EVs, with cell sourcing among the biggest costs for most EV makers. The Bengaluru-based firm has already begun manufacturing of the more efficient 4680 form of battery cells, but only for testing. These cells are known to be more efficient than their widely used 2170 counterparts, but many, like Tesla, have struggled to scale up production. Ola's 4680 cells have received a key domestic certification, Aggarwal said. The company will have an initial capacity to annually produce about 1.5 gigawatt hours (GWh) worth cells, for which it has invested $100 million, he added",

            "articleBody": "Prague: Czech car maker Skoda is lining up new models, expanding sales network and also looking to forge partnerships to scale up business in India, the most important market for the brand outside Europe, according to global CEO Klaus Zellmer. The company, which currently sells models like Kushaq and Slavia in the country, aims to drive in an all-new compact SUV early next year hoping to almost double its sales volume in the market. Skoda Auto India sold around 49,000 units last year. India is the world's third-largest passenger vehicle market with annual dispatches surging to 42 lakh units in FY24.  The automaker, a part of the Volkswagen Group, is also looking to introduce electric vehicles in the country.  In an interaction here, Skoda Auto global CEO Klaus Zellmer said the automaker is willing to learn and be totally customer-centric as it considers India as the most important market for the brand after Europe.  \"Outside Europe, our most important adventure is India because this is the place to be going forward,\" he stated. India is crucial to the growth strategy of Skoda Auto as the automaker brings its broadest and most up to date product portfolio ever to customers, Zellmer said. The country also gives the brand a competitive advantage in its international expansion strategy, he added. \"There is so much happening'&brvbar; we believe in India's growth potential, and of course we will be a part of that,\" he stated. Zellmer noted that with the brand moving out from Russia and not doing so well in China, it expects to do well in India going forward. \"In a business, it is always not wise to stand on one leg. In our case, this is Europe. If it gets a little shaky, you want to stand on two legs, and the second leg for us is India,\" he said. Zellmer further said: \"India is not only the most attractive region for us outside Europe, it is also the most competitive environment.\" There are new competitors, new entrants with new cars, so it really is a predatory environment, he noted. Zellmer said the automaker has learnt its lessons and is now looking at enhanced localisation in India to be more competitive in terms of pricing. \"Often we build cars according to our own expectations, and they tend to be over-engineered. And, for that engineering, it always comes at a price tag and of course it is something that weakens our competitive position. So we need to learn, we need to be aware of the sweet spot,\" he stated. In 2018, Volkswagen (VW) announced a major rejig in plans for the Indian operations giving group firm Skoda the responsibility for the market. When asked if the company is also looking to tie up with an automotive manufacturer in India, he stated that one option is to \"stand alone\" and the other option is to find a partner.  \"I very much believe in a scenario where we find a partner to be more in tune with society, with customers, with the industry, with all the prerequisites in order to be successful,\" Zellmer noted. \"We're currently discussing with various (prospective) partners,\" he added.  He noted that the intention is that the partnership should work out well for the entities, with both bringing something to the table. It would be an equity partnership, Zellmer confirmed when asked about the details. He however did not elaborate on the entities the automaker is in talks with for the intended partnership. The Volkswagen group already has a partnership with the Mahindra group for electric vehicle components. Zellmer noted that the group would continue to invest in the country even if it continues to operate solo. He said the automaker is now gearing up to enhance its sales network in India as it gears up to introduce the compact SUV in the country. \"We have 250 touchpoints now for our customers. By the end of the year, we're looking at about 300 in order to have reasonable coverage and to really attract as many customers for that car as possible,\" Zellmer said. The brand is looking to enhance presence in smaller towns and cities with the latest expansion. Zellmer stated that the brand continues to consider other models for the market including the fully electric Enyaq. \"EV penetration in the country is expected to grow between 15-30 per cent and our global strategy is to offer customers the best of the worlds with their choice of electric or highly efficient combustion powertrains,\" he added. The automaker also aims to make India an export hub. \"Our development and manufacturing base in Pune is a springboard into ASEAN and the Middle East. The capabilities we have to build in India for India and related export capacity are helping us achieve new international sales beyond Europe,\" Zellmer said.",

The World Bank on June 29, approved USD 1.5 billion in financing to accelerate India's development of low-carbon energy.\"The financing will help India promote low-carbon energy by scaling up renewable energy, developing green hydrogen, and stimulating climate finance for low-carbon energy investments.,\" the World Bank said in a blog post.Apart from this second phase of financing stimulus, last year in June 2023, the World Bank approved the USD 1.5 billion First Low-Carbon Energy Programmatic Development Policy Operation, which supported the waiver of transmission charges for renewable energy in green hydrogen projects.With this financing, efforts will be made to enhance the market capability for green hydrogen. The emphasis will also be given to scaling up renewable energy and stimulating finance for low-carbon energy investments, as per the statement.The second Low-Carbon Energy Programmatic Development Policy Operation will support reforms to boost the production of green hydrogen and electrolyzers, critical technology needed for green hydrogen production. The operation also supports reforms to boost renewable energy penetration, for instance, by incentivizing battery energy storage solutions and amending the Indian Electricity Grid Code to improve renewable energy integration into the grid.Recognising the need to separate India's economic growth from emission growth, the World Finance Organisation pointed out that decoupling economic growth from emissions growth will require scaling up renewable energy, especially in hard-to-abate industrial sectors.It added that India will require an expansion of green hydrogen production and consumption as well as a faster development of climate finance to boost the mobilisation of finance for low-carbon investments. The reforms supported by the operation are expected to result in the production of at least 450,000 metric tons of green hydrogen and 1,500 MW of electrolyzers per year from the financial year 2025-26 onwards.In addition, it will also help to increase renewable energy capacity and support reductions in emissions by 50 million tons per year. The operation will also support steps to further develop a national carbon credit market. ",

IFFCO had approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in March seeking to restrain Triumph Offshore and SEL from issuing any share/securities to lenders for paying loans and passing any such resolution without its approval.  In its petition, IFFCO had argued that it was pre-paying the debt and it may result into dilution of its shareholding in Triumph Offshore.  A two-member bench of the NCLT allowed IFFCO to withdraw its plea.  \"Counsel for applicants seeks permission to withdraw the application. They have also filed an affidavit. In view of the same, permission is granted,\" said the NCLT order passed on June 27.  Triumph Offshore was established as a joint venture to set up a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) with Swan Energy holding the majority stake of 51 per cent.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Underscoring the employment opportunity from the adoption of retrofitting in inter-city diesel passenger buses, a recent report said that it is projected to add 6000-7000 direct jobs and 36,000-42,000 new indirect jobs over the next few years.Converting current internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric ones is known as retrofitting. The procedure entails swapping out the original engine and any associated parts for a new alternative energy source that will be installed inside the current vehicle body.The report jointly prepared by the Foundation for Economic Growth and Welfare (EGROW Foundation) in collaboration with Primus Partners further added that if the country retrofits 20,000 buses annually, it can save about 500,000 tons of diesel and reduce crude oil imports by 12.7 million barrels yearly. The industry can also contribute substantially to India's goal of creating 30-35 million new green jobs by 2047.Underscoring the benefit of retrofitting, it stated that retrofit buses significantly reduce operatingand maintenance costs compared to traditional and new electric buses. Particularly, when considering the lifespan and daily operational parameters, the cost per kilometre for retrofitted buses emerges substantially lower, reinforcing the economic argument for retrofitting.The report also analysed the financial benefit of this process and stated that it helps to achieve a faster return on investment (ROI), making it an attractive option for bus fleet operators and government authorities alike.Highlighting the benefit of adopting retrofitting It notes that an ICE bus costs more than Rs 29 per km, while an electric one costs Rs 28 per km. In contrast, a 9-metre retrofitted bus costs Rs19 per km, a 12-metre retrofitted bus with two batteries costs nearly Rs22 per km and a 12-metre retrofitted bus with three batteries costs marginally more than Rs23 per km. Thus Retrofitted 9-meter buses are 32.1 per cent more cost-effective than a new EV bus. The 9-metre retrofitted bus is the most economical option.It also outlined policy recommendations suggesting that specific policies to increase retrofitted bus numbers in India.\"The government should also incorporate retrofitting incentives into the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) policy to boost EV adoption,\" the report added.GST norms, modifying the existing vehicle scrapping policy, and revisiting state retrofit EV Policies are among the top policy recommendations of the report.Commenting on the findings, Dr. Charan Singh, Chief Executive Office at EGROW Foundation and Davinder Sandhu, Chairperson, Primus Partners in their foreword opined, \"The economic benefits of this approach are profound, extending beyond mere financial savings to broader economic revitalization and environmental improvements. Retrofitting offers a pragmatic solution, leveraging existing infrastructure while transitioning towards cleaner mobility. It represents a critical step towards sustainable urban transport, demonstrating how innovation and policy alignment can drive tangible progress.\"",

            "articleBody": "SYDNEY: Anglo American said on Sunday it was battling an underground fire at its Grosvenor metallurgical coal mine in Australia's Queensland state after a blaze ignited there on Saturday. The mine site is in the coal mining town of Moranbah, located approximately 1,000 km (621 miles) north of state capital Brisbane. It is the same mine where an explosion in May 2020 critically injured five workers. \"We are continuing to manage a combustion event underground at Grosvenor Mine, following a localised ignition at the longwall on Saturday,\" Anglo American said on Facebook on Sunday. \"Our priority is to safely extinguish the underground fire, which emergency response teams are managing from the surface.\" The site was closed, with only essential emergency services team members in attendance, it said in an earlier Facebook post. Anglo American said work had started to temporarily seal the mine from the surface, which was a \"critical step\" in stopping smoke from the fire impacting residents in the town of 9,425 people. \"Due to the highly complex and evolving nature of this event, this will take time as we need to ensure the safety of all emergency teams undertaking this work,\" the company said. All mine workers were safely evacuated after the fire ignited. A spokesperson for Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said the agency was not at the incident, which was being handled by the mine. Queensland Mines Minister Scott Stewart said there would be a \"full and thorough investigation\" into the fire, the Australian Broadcasting Corp reported on Sunday. The Grosvenor mine produced 2.797 million tons of metallurgical coal in 2023, making up 17% of Anglo American's coal output, according to its annual report. The company is the world's third largest exporter of metallurgical coal. At the mine, the company uses the longwall mining method, a method used to extract long panels of coal in a single slice.

            "articleBody": "Chandigarh: Haryana will soon get waste-to-charcoal plants, also known as green coal plants, said an official statement here on Sunday. An MoU for this plant will be signed between NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVNL) and the Haryana Government. After setting up the plants in Gurugram-Manesar and Faridabad, this initiative will be expanded to other cities in Haryana. NVVNL officers will soon visit a few sites for establishing green coal plants. \"Due to the strenuous efforts of Union Power and Housing and Urban Affairs Minister, Manohar Lal Khattar, Haryana will soon get waste-to-charcoal plants, also known as green coal plants,\" the statement said. A meeting in this regard was held on Friday evening at Shram Shakti Bhawan in New Delhi, chaired by Khattar, it said. \"The minister is highly committed to reducing the problem of the increasing quantity of municipal solid waste and using it beneficially for renewable energy production. During the meeting on waste-to-energy, detailed discussions were held on NVVNL's initiative to produce green coal from solid waste,\" the statement said. According to the statement, green coal, also known as bio-coal, is a sustainable alternative to traditional waste, as it can be blended with regular coal for electricity generation in thermal power plants. NVVNL recently established a plant in Varanasi to produce green coal from solid waste. Once fully operational, this plant will consume 600 tonnes of waste and produce 200 tonnes of green coal, leaving very little residue. NVVNL is also working in various stages to set up green coal plants in Haldwani, Vadodara, Noida, Gorakhpur, and Bhopal, it said. During the meeting, Khattar directed that green coal projects should be established in various districts of Haryana. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation Gurugram Dr Narhari Singh Bangar mentioned that the MCG has already initiated this process and shown some sites in Gurugram with the NVVNL officials. Khattar, who is also former Chief Minister of Haryana, instructed that the MC, in collaboration with NVVNL, should set up a green coal plant at Bandhwari or alternative sites around Gurugram and Manesar. He stated that this plant should be capable of consuming around 1200 tonnes of solid waste daily. Similarly, Faridabad MC should start the process with NVVNL to set up a plant with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes per day on the available land in village Mothuka. Establishing waste-to-green coal plants in Gurugram-Manesar and Faridabad will not only provide a permanent solution to the waste problem but also increase energy production, he said.",

            "articleBody": "BRUSSELS: Three-quarters of the European Union's electricity has been generated by CO2 emissions-free sources so far this year, making it the bloc's greenest power mix to date, industry data showed on Monday. Emissions-free sources produced 74% of EU electricity in January-June, of which 50% was from renewable sources like wind and solar, and 24% from nuclear, industry association Eurelectric said. \"The electricity generation of Europe has never had such a low-carbon profile before,\" Eurelectric Secretary General Kristian Ruby told Reuters. Coal produced 9% of EU electricity and gas 13% - the lowest shares for each fossil fuel for the same period in any year to date. The main driver of Europe's changing energy mix is the rapid installation of renewable energy capacity. The EU built 56 gigawatts of new solar power capacity in 2023 - the highest in any year to date - and 16GW of new wind capacity. However, Europe's electricity demand has also decreased, making it easier for green sources to cover a bigger share of the overall mix. EU power demand was 5.8% lower in the first half of this year than in the same period in 2021. European energy prices surged to record highs in 2022 after Russia slashed gas supplies to Europe. The resulting energy crisis forced industries and consumers to use less energy to curb their bills - with some industries yet to recover production to pre-crisis levels, depressing their energy consumption. More renewable energy will help Europe meet its climate targets and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. But there are signs countries' ageing power grids are struggling to cope with the changing energy mix. Belgian power grid operator Elia warned last month that a recent jump in Belgium's solar power capacity will cause periods of surplus cheap energy this summer, making it harder to balance the grid. Ruby urged policymakers to invest in upgrading power grids to cope with bigger shares of renewable capacity, including by adding storage capacity to absorb cheap excess power so it doesn't go to waste. \"We need a physical build-out of the grid with quite a bit of urgency,\" he said.

The country's share of coal in electricity generation rose for the fifteenth straight year in 2023, the data showed, despite a target to cut dependence on the fuel to less than half of total power output by 2030. Kosovo had the highest coal dependence in 2023 according to the data released by Ember, with 88.21% of its power coming from the polluting fuel. Mongolia, South Africa, India and Kazakhstan followed by the Philippines ranked 7th on the list. Coal accounted for 61.92% of all electricity generated in the archipelago in 2023, from 59.07% in 2022 - the highest jump in dependence on the fossil fuel since 2016. The Philippines wants to double solar additions and triple wind capacity in 2030 from current levels and is betting on a rapid build out of offshore wind farms. While the Philippines surpassed Indonesia, ranked 8th, in terms of share of coal in power generation, coal continued to be Indonesia's preferred fuel. China fell outside of the top 10 in 2023 as an acceleration in renewables helped cut the share of coal in its electricity generation, but it remained the largest overall generator of coal-fired power, with India second. \"Both Indonesia and the Philippines lag behind other countries in the ASEAN region in their wind and solar deployment,\" Ember said in a statement on Monday. Indonesia and the Philippines have struggled to boost renewable capacity due to the costs involved. Indonesia became the world's fifth largest generator of coal-fired power, with output growing at an average pace of 7.1% over 8 years to overtake South Korea for the first time. \"This ascent included surpassing Australia in 2018, Germany in 2019, Russia in 2020 and South Africa in 2022,\" Ember said.

            "articleBody": "It also banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, in addition to imposing a ban on technology to extract and separate rare earths.  China has unveiled a list of rare earth regulations aimed at protecting supplies in the name of national security, laying out rules on the mining, smelting and trade in the critical materials used to make products from magnets in electric vehicles to consumer electronics. The regulations, issued by the State Council or cabinet on Saturday, say rare earth resources belong to the state, and that the government will oversee the development of the industry around rare earths - a group of 17 minerals of which China has in recent years become the world's dominant producer, accounting for nearly 90% of global refined output. Their global industrial significance is such that under a law that entered into force in May the EU set ambitious 2030 targets for domestic production of minerals crucial in the green transition - particularly rare earths due to their use in permanent magnets that power motors in EVs and wind energy. EU demand is forecast to soar sixfold in the decade to 2030 and sevenfold by 2050. The new Chinese regulations, which will take effect on Oct. 1, say the State Council will establish a rare earth product traceability information system. Enterprises in rare earth mining, smelting and separation, and the export of rare earth products, shall establish a product flow record system, shall \"truthfully\" record the flow, and shall enter it into the traceability system, the State Council said. China already last year introduced restrictions on exports of the elements germanium and gallium, used widely in the chip-making sector, citing the need to protect national security and interests. It also banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, in addition to imposing a ban on technology to extract and separate rare earths. Those rules fanned fears that restrictions in rare earth supplies might help increase tensions with the West, particularly the United States, which accuses China of using economic coercion to influence other countries. Beijing denies the claim. China's rare earths regulations also come as the EU gears up to impose provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs on July 4 to protect the 27-state bloc from what it says is a flood of EVs produced with unfair state subsidies, though both sides have said they plan talks on the proposed tariffs.

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Google said it has taken a stake in Taiwan's New Green Power and could buy up to 300 megawatts of renewable energy from the BlackRock fund-owned firm to help cut its carbon emissions and those of suppliers. Companies are being pushed to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to their operations and value chains by investors and Big Tech firms have been among the most ambitious in their targets. Google aims to constantly run on carbon-free energy wherever it operates. Yet sector growth in demand for data-processing capacity to power artificial intelligence has seen emissions jump. Taiwan, a major site for Google's cloud technology with a data centre and company offices, still relied on fossil fuels to generate nearly 85% of its power, Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's Global Head of Data Center Energy told Reuters. \"The goal of this investment is really to support the build out of a large-scale solar pipeline in Taiwan,\" Corio added. Regions such as Asia Pacific can be harder to decarbonise due to less developed infrastructure and restrictions limiting the ability of corporate users to buy green power. New Green Power, owned by a fund managed by BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure business, was one of the leading solar developers and operators in Taiwan, BlackRock's Global Head of Climate Infrastructure David Giordano told Reuters. Google and BlackRock both declined to specify the size of the equity stake being taken in NGP, but Corio said the investment was expected to drive the equity and debt financing for the build-out of its 1 gigawatt (GW) pipeline. Taiwan is targeting 20 GW of solar capacity by 2025 and up to 80 GW by 2050, BlackRock said. Corio said that as well as using some of the solar power it buys to drive its own operations, Google would also be able to offer some to its suppliers and manufacturers in the region. Sharing with suppliers would help Google lower its so-called Scope 3 emissions, those tied to its value chain, she added. ",

            "articleBody": "The construction of the Rs 12,940-crore 'Urja Ganga' gas pipeline, India's most ambitious project taking environment-friendly fuel to eastern parts of the country, has been delayed by nine months and will now be completed by March 2025, state-owned GAIL (India) Ltd said. The 3,306-kilometre Jagdishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra pipeline was originally targeted for completion by June 2024. But due to \"delay in right of use (RoU) availability\", the completion schedule has been revised \"from June 2024 to March 2025\", GAIL said in a stock exchange filing. The bulk of the pipeline has already been constructed, and gas has started to flow in most cities along the route. Traditionally, natural gas was available for use as fuel to generate electricity, make fertiliser or turn into CNG and cooking gas only in the western and northern parts of the country, as pipelines taking the fuel from source to users were limited to these parts. In October 2016, work on laying a pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal, Bokaro in Jharkhand and Dhamra in Odisha began. The line was extended to Guwahati in Assam from Barauni in Bihar, a length of 726 km, to take the fuel to hereto-unconnected states in the eastern region. The Jagdishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline (JHBDPL), popularly called the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga pipeline, is to supply gas to the eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. GAIL, the firm executing the pipeline, said its board of directors in a meeting on June 28 approved the revision of the completion schedule. The completion schedule for the 240-km Dhamra-Haldia pipeline has also been revised from June 2024 to March 2025, it added. The company on May 10, 2019, stated that it has completed awards of all major contracts worth Rs 10,500 crore for pipeline supply and laying of the integrated 3400-km Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) and Barauni-Guwahati Pipeline (BGPL) pipeline. The government provided 40 per cent viability gap funding amounting to Rs 5,176 crore for execution of JHBDPL. For the Barauni-Guwahati pipeline, a 60 per cent viability gap funding, amounting to Rs 5,559 crore, has been provided by the government. The Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga pipeline will connect all the geographical areas (more than 90) spread over Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and further to the northeastern region of India. When the project is fully completed, the northeastern/eastern part of India will become an integral part of the gas-based economy with the twin benefits of the cheapest gas transportation through Urja Ganga and gas pricing reforms. Under the unified tariff regulations recently notified by sector regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), transportation tariff has been cut by about 50 per cent to Rs 99.90 per million British thermal units for the eastern parts, helping make the clean fuel more affordable. The pipeline has already started feeding seven city gas distribution (CGD) projects in Varanasi, Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, and Cuttack. The pipeline also connects the refineries, located at Barauni, Haldia, and Paradip. The JHBDPL has a transmission capacity of 16 million cubic metres of natural gas a day.",

            "articleBody": "Oil prices edged up in early trade on Monday, supported by forecasts of a supply deficit stemming from peak summer fuel consumption and OPEC+ cuts in the third quarter, although global economic headwinds and rising non-OPEC+ output capped gains. Brent crude futures rose 16 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $85.16 a barrel by 0032 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $81.71 a barrel, up 17 cents, or 0.2 per cent. Both contracts gained around 6 per cent in June, with Brent has settling above $85 a barrel in the past two weeks, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, extended most of its deep oil output cuts well into 2025.  That led analysts to forecast supply deficits in the third quarter as transportation and air-conditioning demand during summer draw down fuel stockpiles. Hopes of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and rising geopolitical concerns in Europe and between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah have also kept a floor under prices, IG analyst Tony Sycamore said in a note. WTI's recent rally may extend towards $85 a barrel if prices remain above the 200-day moving average at $79.52, he said. In the US, oil production and demand rose to a four-month high in April, according to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Petroleum Supply Monthly report published on Friday. Traders are watching out for the impact from hurricanes on oil and gas production and consumption in the Americas. The Atlantic hurricane season started with Hurricane Beryl on Sunday. Beryl, the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record, headed toward the Caribbean's Windward Islands where it is expected to bring life-threatening winds and flash flooding on Monday, the US National Hurricane Center said. In China, the latest manufacturing data did not bode well for oil demand in the world's no.2 consumer and top crude importer. China's manufacturing activity fell for a second month in June while services activity slipped to a five-month low, an official survey showed on Sunday, keeping alive calls for further stimulus as the economy struggles to get back on its feet.",

With seven solar plants, a solar carport, and floating solar panels, it has an installed capacity of 50 MW at present. &ldquo;We have decided to double our installed capacity of solar power generation in the next 5-10 years and are prepared to develop more solar production plants if there is a hike in energy needs, which means development of additional energy sources in adjacent districts,&rdquo; Suhas said in an exclusive interaction.He said that this target involves the installation of new solar plants in remote locations, similar to the Payyanur plant. &ldquo;The investment for scaling up solar capacity will be substantial, reflecting the ambitious targets set by CIAL. This investment will be meticulously planned, sourced from a combination of internal funds and green energy subsidies,&rdquo; he added.In addition to solar projects, CIAL also plans to venture into run-of-the-river hydroelectric projects &ndash; it already has a commissioned project in Arippara. &ldquo;The identification of suitable locations for both solar and hydro projects is underway, ensuring that the chosen sites will optimise energy production while minimising environmental impact,&rdquo; he said. He added that with these initiatives, CIAL will also contribute excess power to the state grid.On the recent MoU with BPCL for a green hydrogen pilot plant, CIAL&rsquo;s MD informed that they are exploring an integrated production model to produce green hydrogen where the electricity will be sourced from CIAL&rsquo;s solar plants. &ldquo;The plan for the green hydrogen plant has been set in motion since the agreement in February 2024. While specific milestones and the current stage of development have not been detailed, such projects typically follow a phased approach, starting with design, procurement, construction, and commissioning,&rdquo; he said. He added that the timeline for completion can vary, but pilot projects like this one might take a year or two to become fully operational.In February this year, CIAL signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-run Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) for setting up the country&rsquo;s first green hydrogen plant in an airport.According to the agreement, BPCL will invest Rs 30 crore which will cover the costs of technology, infrastructure, and operations management of the 1,000 kW plant at Kochi Airport. Whereas, CIAL will provide suitable land, water, and green energy for the plant which is expected to be completed in early 2025.On new technology adoption, Suhas said that they are exploring the potential of smart grid technologies. &ldquo;We are actively monitoring advancements in areas such as energy storage solutions, geothermal energy, and bioenergy, which could complement our existing infrastructure. Additionally, we are exploring the potential of smart grid technologies to improve energy efficiency and management,&rdquo; he said. He added that their approach is to evaluate and pilot new technologies that can enhance CIAL&rsquo;s operational efficiency. CIAL produces 200,000 units of power daily which exceeds the airport&rsquo;s needs, making it power positive. By April 2024, it generated 35 crore units of power, cutting carbon emissions by 28,000 metric tonnes annually.",

CSL said it has won an international order from Wilson ASA, Norway, for the design and construction of four 6,300 TDW dry cargo vessels. \"An agreement has also been entered into for an additional four vessels of the same type, which will be formally contracted within September 19, 2024,\" a CSL release said. CSL said the new order was a continuation of the contract awarded in June 2023 for the design and construction of six 3800 TDW dry cargo vessels, which are now at advanced levels of construction at the yard at Udupi in Karnataka. \"The vessel is of 100 meters length and has a deadweight of 6300 metric tonnes at a design draft of 6.5 metres. The vessels shall be designed by Conoship International, Netherlands, and shall be constructed as an environment-friendly diesel-electric vessel for the transport of general cargo in the coastal waters of Europe,\" CSL said. It said the overall project of eight vessels was worth about Rs 1,100 crore and was to be executed by September 2028. Wilson ASA, a company headquartered in Bergen, Norway, is the leading short-sea fleet operator in Europe and transports about 15 million tonnes of dry cargo across Europe, CSL said. The company operates a fleet of around 130 vessels, ranging from 1500 to 8500 DWT. Since the takeover of the yard by Cochin Shipyard Limited, UCSL has successfully delivered two 62T Bollard Pull Tugs to Ocean Sparkle Limited, an Adani Harbour Services Limited Company and one 70T Bollard Pull Tug to Polestar Maritime Limited, the first lot of the tugs with Approved Standard Tug Design &amp; Specifications (ASTDS) promulgated by the Government of India for Indian Ports. UCSL has also received further orders of four 70T Bollard Pull Tugs as repeat orders from Ocean Sparkle Limited (three) and Polestar Maritime Limited (one).",

The production of the eight sectors grew 6.7 per cent in April. The growth of these core sectors -- coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertiliser, steel, cement and electricity -- was 5.2 per cent in May 2023. The official data showed that fertiliser, crude oil, and cement output recorded negative growth in May. During April-May this fiscal, the output of these sectors was up 6.5 per cent against 4.9 per cent in the same period last fiscal. The production growth of coal, natural gas and electricity rose by 10.2 per cent, 7.5 per cent and 12.8 per cent, respectively, against 7.2 per cent, (-) 0.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent in May 2023. The growth rate in the production of refinery products and steel slowed down to 0.5 per cent and 7.6 per cent during the month under review. The eight core sectors contribute 40.27 per cent to the country's Index of Industrial Production (IIP). Commenting on the data, Icra Ltd Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said that while the core sector growth sustained above 6 per cent for the fourth consecutive month, it eased slightly in May. A combination of factors, including the heatwave over parts of the country and the phased parliamentary elections could have curtailed activity and execution in some sectors, she added. \"At the same time, the heatwave boosted demand for power, which translated into a rise in the growth of coal and electricity in May 2024 compared to the previous month. We expect IIP growth print at 4-5 per cent in May 2024,\" she added.",

            "articleBody": "Una: Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu laid the foundation stone of the 10 MW solar power project at Aghlor in Kutlehar Assembly Constituency of Una district on Friday. The project will be constructed in an area of 19 hectares and completed within three months. It will produce 22.73 million units of power every year, generating an income of Rs 8 crore. This project will also help in reducing 791 tonnes of carbon emission, a statement issued here said. The chief minister said this was the second solar power project in Una district after the 32 MW Pekhubela project, which was completed within a record time of six months and will generate income of Rs 20 crore. He said that despite being a power-plus state, Himachal Pradesh purchases electricity from the open market between October and March by spending around Rs 1,500 crore as the power production in the hydroelectric projects minimises during winters due to receding water level in rivers. The state government has signed an agreement with the Oil India Company for the production of green hydrogen and emphasis was being laid on harnessing solar energy, he said, adding that the government was also encouraging harnessing solar power in the private sector as well. Sukhu, who also inspected water sports activities in Andrauli in the Kutlehar, said the state government was giving added priority to the promotion of the tourism sector. He noted that the government would develop the Andrauli area to increase footfall, besides making it an attraction for tourists visiting the state. Tourism was an important sector for strengthening the state's economy and offers ample employment and self-employment opportunities to the youth, he added. He further said the government was actively promoting religious, adventure and eco-tourism to ensure that those visiting the state have a memorable experience to cherish. He reiterated that the government aims to attract five crore tourists annually in the near future.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Centre has extended the advisory for coal blending in thermal power stations to ensure an uninterrupted power supply in light of rising demand. The ministry of power has issued a directive to all GENCOs, including Independent Power Producers (IPPs), to continue blending imported coal at a minimum of 6 per cent by weight with domestic coal until June 2024.This directive comes as a strategic response to a substantial gap of approximately 12 million tonnes between the receipt of domestic coal and its consumption noted from September 1 to October 9, 2023. Originally set at a 4 per cent blending rate before adjusting to 6 per cent, the policy aims to enhance power production and address the shortfall in domestic coal supplies.Despite increased domestic coal production and improved logistics, power demand peaked at 250 GW in May 2024 due to high consumption rates during the summer season. The Ministry's review highlighted that logistical challenges during monsoon seasons historically lead to reduced coal supply, affecting power generation.The ministry emphasized the government's commitment to ensuring stable and uninterrupted power supply throughout the country. \"Maintaining adequate coal reserves in domestic coal-based plants by all Central/State GENCOs and IPPs is crucial to meet the peak power demand during the upcoming summer months,\" it added.The extension of the coal blending advisory reflects the government's proactive approach to managing the nation's energy requirements and stabilizing the power generation sector amidst fluctuating global energy markets and domestic supply challenges.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India, holding the fifth-largest coal reserves globally and ranking as the second-largest consumer, has seen notable changes in its coal production and import patterns, reflecting a strategic shift towards enhancing energy self-reliance.According to recent data, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for coal production in India rose from 4.44 per cent during the fiscal years 2004-05 to 2013-14, to approximately 5.63 per cent from 2014-15 to 2023-24. This growth signifies the country's concerted efforts to increase domestic coal output in the past decade.Concurrently, the CAGR for coal imports saw a significant decrease. From a high of 21.48 per cent between 2004-05 and 2013-14, it plummeted to just 2.49 per cent from 2014-15 to 2023-24. Furthermore, the share of imported coal in overall consumption also dropped, with the CAGR plummeting from 13.94 per cent in the earlier period to around -2.29 per cent in the latter period.These trends underscore India&rsquo;s strategic focus on reducing dependence on imported coal, despite the necessity for imports to meet specific industrial needs such as steel production, due to the unavailability of coking coal and high-grade thermal coal within domestic reserves.The shift is part of India's broader aim to optimize its indigenous coal resources and leverage innovative technology to bolster energy security. This approach aligns with the national goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), emphasizing the importance of self-sufficiency in critical sectors such as energy.As India progresses on this path, the reduction in import dependency and the enhancement of domestic coal production capacities are set to play pivotal roles in the country's energy landscape.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The government is in the process of finalising a policy to offer washed PCI coal to steel makers in order to reduce imports, a senior official said on Friday. PCI (pulverized coal injection) coal is a type of metallurgical coal, which is used in the steel making process as auxiliary fuel for partial replacement of coke. It helps steel plant increase efficiency and reduce carbon emissions.  \"We are actually thinking about a policy...whereby we will be washing and offering washed PCI coal to the steel sector (only specifically to the steel sector) end use so that we will be able to reduce imports,\" M Nagaraju, additional secretary, coal, said at a workshop on coal matrix for the Indian metals industry organised by industry body Ficci here.  He also said that there was a need to remove ash content in PCI coal.  At present, most of the steel makers in the country import PCI coal and its demand is expected to go up to anywhere between 20-30 million tonnes by 2030, Nagaraju said.  \"We are finalising a policy and once done, we will be able to offer washed coking coal to the steel sector specifically so that they are able to blend with the imported coking coal and reduce imports,\" he said.  Nagaraju further said that the government will set up about eight coking coal washeries to meet the demand of the steel sector.  \"We are going to set up about eight coking coal washeries so that by 2030 we will be having at least 60 million tonnes of washed coking coal in the country to meet the steel sector demand,\" he added.  According to mjunction services -- a B2B e-commerce platform -- India's coking coal imports rose to 57.22 million tonnes in FY24 compared to 54.46 MT imported in FY23. Imports of PCI coal also increased to 16.69 MT in 2023-24, against 15.69 MT a year ago. MT",

Speaking at the FICCI workshop titled 'Coal Matrix for Indian Metals Industry', Nagaraju outlined the government's robust plan for the coal sector, including a significant focus on reducing import dependencies and enhancing domestic capabilities.The government has initiated the coking coal mission with a strategic target to reach 140 million tons by 2030. As part of this plan, Nagaraju announced the establishment of eight coking coal washeries to meet the increasing demand of the steel sector. \"By 2029-30, we should have the capacity to produce as much coal as the country demands and be in a position to supply coal to other countries,\" he said.Furthermore, the Ministry of Coal is in the process of finalizing a policy that will facilitate the washery route for coking coal, which will help in offering washed coking coal to the steel industry for blending with imported coal. This move is aimed at enhancing the quality of domestic coal and reducing the steel sector's reliance on foreign coal.In addition to these initiatives, the government is also promoting coal gasification with an allocation of Rs 8,500 crore to support the set-up of coal gasification plants by both private and public sectors. Nagaraju highlighted the potential for diversification within the coal industry through this initiative.Avinash Kumar Mishra, Executive Director (Coal) at the Railway Board, emphasized the logistical support being planned to aid the coal sector. He noted that the Railways would offer specialized wagons for transporting coal, particularly for the emerging coal gasification market. Mishra also mentioned the significant improvement in coal availability over the last two years, attributing it to increased imports which are expected to reduce as domestic production escalates.",

Many of the vehicles affected by tariffs are fitted with batteries from CATL, which is aiming to ramp up its operations in Europe next year.Based in the coastal Chinese city of Ningde, the company is currently building a second European factory in Hungary.At home, the firm's success in recent years has been galvanised by rapid growth in the domestic market.Not only had China seen \"a massive introduction\" of personal car ownership over the past 30 years, but also the establishment of \"the capability, the entire supply ecosystem\" for EVs, Ni said.This gave Chinese firms a huge advantage in the global shift towards green transport.\"There's already capability for China to go quickly,\" he said.",

At the launch of the first integrated motorcycle Freedom 125 here, Bajaj also voiced concerns about the use of \"unsustainable subsidies\" to promote electric vehicles.  Earlier, he along with Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari launched the world's first CNG-run bike in three variants at a starting price of Rs 95,000 (ex-showroom).  \"I would call it a suggestion that the government should seriously review GST rates...Just as they've done the right thing with the five per cent GST for electric (vehicles),\" Bajaj said.  Calling the subsidies \"paradoxically unsustainable\" and the ongoing push for the electrification in the automobile industry across the world \"chaos,\" he said, \"How can sustainable technologies be promoted by unsustainable subsidies, not only in India but worldwide...we want freedom from all of this.\"  According to Bajaj, there is no party happening in the EV segment as of now.  This groundbreaking innovation will revolutionise the two-wheeler industry by providing a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional petrol motorcycles, the company said.  Bajaj Auto claims that its Freedom CNG motorcycle offers around 50 per cent cost savings by significantly reducing fuel expenses compared to similar petrol motorcycles.  The CNG tank provides a range of 200-plus kilometres on just 2 kilograms of CNG fuel.  Additionally, it has a 2-litre petrol tank which performs as a range extender, offering over 130 km of range in case the CNG tank empties, ensuring an uninterrupted journey.  \"The Bajaj Freedom 125 showcases Bajaj Auto Ltd R&amp;D and manufacturing prowess. Through innovation, Bajaj Auto Ltd has addressed the twin challenge of reducing rising fuel costs and reducing the environmental footprint from travel. The initiative also aligns strongly with the government of India infrastructure projects if building a CNG network driven by the need to use cleaner fuels and save foreign tourism exchange,\" Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director of Bajaj Auto Ltd, said.",

With this, Gujarat now occupies the second spot in the country after Maharashtra in terms of the FDI inflow, it said. Citing the data released by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the state government said Gujarat has topped the charts in the annual increase in FDI inflow during 2023-24 by recording a jump of USD 2.6 billion. \"Registering a 55 per cent increase in the FDI inflow during FY 2023-24 as compared to the inflow during FY 2022-23, Gujarat received a whopping USD 7.3 billion in FY 2023-24 as compared to the USD 4.7 billion received in the FY 2022-23. With the FDI inflow of USD 7.3 billion, Gujarat moved ahead of Karnataka and Delhi to reach the second spot in the country,\" said the release. With a total FDI inflow of USD 15.1 billion in 2024, Maharashtra occupies the top spot followed by Gujarat with USD 7.3 billion. Karnataka, Delhi and Telangana are on the third, fourth and fifth spots respectively with the FDI inflows of USD 6.6 billion, USD 6.5 billion and USD 3 billion. Aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of Viksit Bharat, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel has enacted numerous industry-friendly policies and decisions, leading to significant positive outcomes in the state, said the release. Gujarat has shown a consistent growth in attracting FDI for three consecutive financial years by securing investments of USD 2.7 billion in FY2022, USD 4.7 billion in FY2023 and USD 7.3 billion in FY2024. Speaking about Gujarat's performance in attracting the FDI inflow, state Industries Minister Balvantsinh Rajput said CM Patel is ensuring that every possible mechanism that facilitates investment and business is in place, ranging from state-of-the-art industrial infrastructure to business-friendly government policies. Among the major factors that have played a role in attracting FDI are Gujarat's state-of-the-art industrial infrastructure, industry-friendly policies, and consistent enhancement in ease of doing business, the release said. Cluster-based industrial regions, such as GIFT City, Sanand GIDC, Dholera SIR (Special Investment Region) and Mandal Becharaji SIR also play a significant role in attracting the investors, it said, adding that marquee projects such as multiple semiconductor manufacturing plants have also played a huge role in attracting foreign investment. Launch and effective implementation of new sector-specific policies in areas such as renewable energy, semiconductor, and information technology (IT) in the last three years have also created a favourable investment climate. Moreover, financial incentives to entrepreneurs and small industries setting up base in Gujarat, expedited allotment of land, power connection and other business-friendly measures have also played a prominent role in bringing new investment.",

            "articleBody": "Kolkata: Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) on Friday announced that it has planned to invest Rs 20,000 crore by 2030 to install nearly 4,000 MW of solar capacity, a top official said. The corporation, created for flood control and development in the Damodar Valley, envisions investment worth Rs 50,000-60,000 crore by 2030 to enhance thermal, pump storage power plants and solar energy, he said. It aims at adding nearly 10,000 MW in thermal and green energy, which will bring its total installed capacity to about 16,700 MW. Of the current 6,700 MW installed capacity of DVC, 6,540 MW is thermal. \"Power demand is growing strong in the north, south, and western parts of the country. We are expanding sustainably with the right mix of thermal and renewable energy, which will keep power costs affordable. We will add 3,720 MW in thermal capacity and nearly 4,000 MW in solar by 2030,\" DVC Chairman S. Suresh Kumar said during an interaction on the occasion of the 77th Foundation Day of the corporation. The Kolkata-headquartered corporation now has only 14 MW installed solar capacity and is executing a 348 MW project in association with NTPC. A 250MW/hour capacity of battery storage is also under consideration, he said. Kumar mentioned that DVC has been exempted from coal import due to its power plants' proximity to the pithead. Recently, the Union Power Ministry has extended a coal import advisory to domestic thermal plants for 4 per cent blending till October 15 to ensure adequate fuel supply during the monsoon season. DVC also plans to ramp up its captive coal mining from its Tubed block in Jharkhand with a separate railway siding for smoother evacuation. \"With the dedicated railway siding for loading, we will be able to ramp up production to six million tonnes. We have proposed to the Railways that we would set up the facility at our cost. Due to current evacuation bottlenecks, our output is below two million tonnes. Captive coal is already cheaper, and if Coal India revises the price further, our coal becomes extremely affordable,\" Kumar said. The maximum annual production can reach up to nine million tonnes, he said. \"The current coal requirement of DVC is 28-30 million tonnes,\" Kumar added. The rest of the coal demand is met from the supplies by Coal India subsidiaries. The corporation is unable to bid for a new coal block due to legal hurdles regarding a legacy case, involving a past joint venture with Bengal Emta Coal Mines, the official said. Kumar, who was the former West Bengal power secretary, stated that apart from the 4,000 MW solar power, the corporation plans to install two pump storage facilities in Logu Pahar in Jharkhand (1500 MW) and Panchet in West Bengal (1000 MW). The Panchet project is proposed to be a JV with the West Bengal government. Speaking about dues from Jharkhand, the DVC official said the old dues have come down to about Rs 1,000 crore, and the state is clearing the same.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The ministry of new &amp; renewable energy has released revised guidelines for the development of onshore wind power projects, particularly updating the micrositing criteria to optimize energy production. This amendment, dated July 4, 2024, introduces refined placement and spacing standards for wind turbines to maximize energy efficiency across wind farms.Under the new guidelines, developers are required to utilize sophisticated wind flow modeling and optimization techniques to adhere to the IEC 61400-1 standard, which governs wind turbine safety under various environmental influences. The criteria stipulate maintaining a minimum distance of five times the rotor diameter (5D) from turbines in the direction of prevailing winds and seven times (7D) perpendicularly, based on the largest turbine's rotor diameter involved.Additionally, the guidelines mandate a buffer of the rotor's diameter plus five meters from public roads and critical infrastructure, aiming to safeguard both the infrastructure and the operational integrity of the wind turbines. To address noise concerns, turbines must not be placed within 500 meters of any residential clusters, defined as areas having at least 15 inhabited buildings unless specified otherwise by state regulations.These modifications are designed to not only improve the output of wind energy projects but also support repowering and intercropping, thus ensuring optimized land use without significant restrictions on turbine placement. The update, now in effect, is expected to influence a wide range of stakeholders within India's growing renewable energy sector.",

This development follows the allocation of the mine to Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) on August 13, 2015, specifically for supplying coal to its thermal power plants.The operational start of the mine was previously stalled due to delays in handing over the necessary forest land, despite receiving Stage-II forest clearance in October 2022. However, recent discussions led by Union Minister of Coal and Mines G Kishan Reddy, with the Government of Odisha, have successfully resolved the issues. On July 4, 2024, approval was granted for the transfer of 643 hectares of forest land to SCCL, paving the way for the mine's operationalization.Reddy thanked Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Manjhi, for his prompt response and cooperation, which were crucial in addressing the long-standing issue. \"This step will further strengthen and secure the energy security needs of Telangana,\" Reddy commented.With the resolution of the land handover issue, SCCL is poised to begin coal production at the Naini mine, significantly enhancing the energy supply critical for Telangana's development.",

This initiative aims to expand India's green hydrogen production capacity to 450,000 tonnes per annum (TPA).Of the total capacity, 40,000 TPA has been earmarked for biomass-based pathways, known as bucket-II, with the remainder allocated to technology-agnostic pathways, or bucket-I. The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) will continue as the implementing agency for this tranche.SECI is set to issue the Request for Selection (RfS) shortly, which will outline the process for competitive bidding based on the least average incentive quoted by the bidders. The minimum bidding capacity under bucket-I is set at 10,000 TPA, while the maximum reaches 90,000 TPA. For bucket-II, the range is between 500 TPA as the minimum and 4,000 TPA as the maximum. A single bidder may be allocated up to 90,000 TPA across both buckets.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched on January 4, 2023, with a funding of Rs. 19,744 crore up to FY 2029-30, underpins this initiative. It aims to contribute to India&rsquo;s ambition to become self-reliant through clean energy and to lead the global clean energy transition. The mission is designed to significantly reduce the nation's carbon footprint, decrease dependence on fossil fuel imports, and establish India as a leader in green hydrogen technology and markets.",

            "articleBody": "BERLIN: Germany could cover up to 100 terawatt-hours (TWh) of its annual energy needs with imports of green hydrogen via pipelines from neighbouring countries by the mid-2030s, covering a significant share of its projected demand, a study showed on Thursday. Berlin is seeking to expand the use of hydrogen as an energy source to cut greenhouse emissions for highly polluting industrial sectors that cannot be electrified, such as steel and chemicals, and cut dependency on imported fossil fuel. Produced using solar and wind power, green hydrogen is a pillar of Germany's planned energy transition, The study by Berlin-based Agora Energiewende and Agora Industry think tanks said that by 2035 hydrogen could cover 11.2% of the country's projected 894 TWh total energy demand. But Germany will need to import around 50% to 70% of its hydrogen due to its limited renewable energy resources. Currently, Germany uses around 55-60 TWh of hydrogen per year but it is produced almost exclusively from fossil fuels, data by the economy ministry showed. The study said that by 2030 Germany could produce 11 TWh of hydrogen and import about 17 TWh of green and some 15 TWh of blue hydrogen, produced from natural gas, via pipelines. That would cover less than half of Germany's total hydrogen demand projected to reach 95 TWh to 130 TWh by the end of the decade. However, by leveraging existing natural gas infrastructure in Europe, Germany could boost pipeline imports to between 60 TWh and 100 TWh by 2035, the study said. \"To achieve climate neutrality, Germany needs a secure and cost-effective supply of renewable hydrogen. Pipeline imports from Europe play a crucial role in this,\" Simon Mueller, Agora Energiewende director, said in statement. To reach this imports potential, Germany will need a financing model and will have to move quickly with agreements on cost-sharing among involved countries, Mueller said. \"This is the only way the required quantities of green hydrogen can be delivered in the first half of the next decade,\" he said. Hydrogen producers and pipeline operators will also need assurances about future hydrogen demand from Germany, Mueller added. The study examined five potential hydrogen pipeline corridors to Germany, considering factors such as production potential, political support, and technical complexity. Promising corridors include imports from Denmark and Norway via the North Sea, and potentially from Sweden and Finland via the Baltic Sea in a later stage due to the distance and technical complexity, it added. In the long term, pipelines from Southern Europe and North Africa, especially Spain and Tunisia, can play a significant role, in addition to possible imports from the United Kingdom, Portugal, Algeria, Greece, and Ukraine.",

Glencore's attempts to buy Teck's steelmaking coal activities was opposed by many shareholders and by Canadian politicians over concerns about the environment and key industries falling into foreign hands. \"We have made significant commitments to the Canadian government aimed at ensuring the transaction is of lasting benefit to Canada... including in relation to employment, the environment and engaging constructively and meaningfully with the Indigenous Nations in the Elk Valley,\" the Swiss company said.  Japanese steel producer Nippon Steel Corporation will take a 20 percent stake in EVR while South Korean steel company Posco will take a 3 percent stake.Glencore has said it wants to group its own coal activities with those of EVR and then possibly split them from the rest of the group.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: JSW Energy, under the leadership of Chairman and Managing Director Sajjan Jindal, is poised to significantly enhance its power generation and storage capabilities, earmarking a substantial capital expenditure (capex) of &#8377;1,15,000 crore to achieve a 20 GW generation target and 40 GWh storage capacity by 2030.In the fiscal year 2024, JSW Energy marked a significant stride in its expansion plan, adding 680 MW of greenfield capacity. This addition has propelled the company&rsquo;s net generation up by 27% year-on-year to 27.9 billion units. Subsequently, the total revenue of the company saw a 10% increase year-on-year, reaching &#8377;11,941 crore. Notably, the EBITDA for the fiscal stood at &#8377;5,837 crore, marking a 53% increase from the previous year, fueled by new additions to the renewable energy asset base and a robust performance from the thermal business.For the upcoming fiscal year 2025, JSW Energy has planned an ambitious capex of &#8377;15,000 crore. \"Your company intends to spend around &#8377;15,000 crore in the current fiscal year as we accelerate our ambitions. Additionally, we are also actively scouting for acquisition opportunities in the power sector,\" said Jindal addressing the stakeholders at the AGM.Amidst a robust project pipeline, JSW Energy achieved a significant milestone by securing 3.4 GW of renewable energy projects through competitive bidding. Additionally, the current year has seen the addition of a pipeline of 600 MW, culminating in a total locked-in capacity of 13.9 GW, representing a remarkable 42% increase compared to the previous fiscal year.The recent fiscal developments included the successful synchronization of the Ind-Barath Unit 1, with a capacity of 350 MW. The second unit of similar capacity is expected to be synchronized within this quarter, underscoring the company&rsquo;s efficient project execution capabilities.In a strategic move to bolster its financial strength for these ambitious projects, JSW Energy successfully raised &#8377;5,000 crore through a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in April 2024. This fundraising was the largest QIP in the power sector and marked the company&rsquo;s first equity raise since its IPO 14 years ago. The issue was subscribed over 3.2 times, attracting significant interest from high-quality global and domestic institutional investors.As JSW Energy continues to diversify its operations, it is also making significant advancements in energy products and services. The company has begun construction of its first Green Hydrogen plant and secured a substantial 6,500 tonnes per annum production capacity under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) program.Sajjan Jindal expressed optimism about the company's strategic direction: \"Your company&rsquo;s proactive approach is on capitalizing growth opportunities within the energy sector, ensuring energy security, and supporting India&rsquo;s decarbonization goals. This is aimed at presenting us as a return-focused, forward-thinking, resilient, and innovative company ready for future opportunities while accelerating current growth momentum.\"JSW Energy's aggressive investment and strategic expansions are set to significantly contribute to India&rsquo;s sustainable energy goals, positioning the company as a leader in the transition towards renewable energy and energy security.",

The world's largest listed miner will only pay 80 per cent of short-term incentives that were on offer in 2023-24, the AFR reported, citing BHP's employees. \"The docking of incentives has upset some BHP employees who contacted the Australian Financial Review pointing to hiring freezes in some divisions that impacted the ability to hit targets and what they see as unrealistic internal goals,\" the report said. These incentives apply to all of BHP's workers and can add up to about 15 per cent of their salaries, according to the report. The company's leadership cited misses on cost and production targets across some of its divisions, as well as the death of a worker at its Saraji coal mine in Queensland in January as the reason behind the incentive cuts, the AFR reported. Moreover, workers at BHP's Queensland coal division will receive only 70 per cent of their incentives, the report added, following two production forecast downgrades and the fatality. This incentive cut comes at a time when Australia's Mining and Energy Union has filed for \"same job same pay\" orders covering labour-hire workers at BHP's Queensland coal mines, which, if successful, would further weigh on its expenses. The miner reported in February that its first-half profit was hit by an impairment charge worth $2.5 billion related to its Western Australia nickel business. It also said some global corporate teams were being disbanded in an effort to cut costs. The company has also failed to meet its target of 3 per cent year-on-year growth in the number of female employees to meet its goal of gender balance by 2025, according to the AFR. However, BHP said in February it became the first miner in Chile to cross 40 per cent female representation , more than doubling the national industry average. BHP did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. ",

            "articleBody": "petrol pump Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal has directed PESO to formulate template of safety measures to allow petrol pumps to operate in areas with habitation within 30-50 metres. Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), a subordinate office under DPIIT, plays a pivotal role in administering regulatory frameworks established under the Explosives Act, 1884 and Petroleum Act, 1934.  The minister also announced 80% concession for women entrepreneurs and 50% for MSMEs in licensing fees for licences granted by PESO.  On Wednesday, Goyal had chaired a stakeholder consultation meeting to solicit insights and feedback from petroleum, explosives, fireworks and other related industry leaders, aimed at enhancing efficiency in the functioning of PESO. \"He (Goyal) directed PESO to formulate guidelines in consultation with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) for creating a template of safety measures allowing retail outlets of petrol pumps to function in cases where there is habitation within 30-50 metres,\" the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement on Thursday.  The minister said that QR code for cylinders is incorporated in the draft Gas Cylinders Rules (GCR) and final notification will be out soon.  He also directed that a committee will be formed to study if a licence for explosives, transport and manufacturing can be given for ten years; a committee will examine the issue regarding increasing the validity of licence to 10 years as all licences except for explosives are given for a duration of ten years.  Petrol pump licences are issued in Form XIV of Petroleum Rules 2002 whereas Licence for CNG dispensing facilities within petroleum retail outlets are issued in Form G of Gas Cylinders Rules. As both the licences are under different Rules and Acts, amendments in the licence in Form XIV are also required to be done after grant of licence for CNG facilities in the same petrol pump.  This amendment will be dispensed with by required changes in the modules. This will reduce the compliance burden as well as the workload of PESO, the ministry said.  In response to the suggestions given and issues raised by the industry during the consultation, Goyal directed MoPNG and the industry associations concerned to form committees to carve out details of suggestions made by them.  The consultation brought together over 150 stakeholders representing various industries of the petroleum, explosives and other related industrial sectors from across the country.",

            "articleBody": "KARACHI: A number of fuel stations were closed across Pakistan on Friday morning following a strike called by petroleum dealers against a new taxation measure introduced by the government to boost revenue and cover its financial shortfall. The Pakistani government has set a challenging revenue collection target to help clinch an International Monetary Fund bailout but faces public anger over new taxes, including taxes on dealers, which were introduced in the annual budget last month. \"There is a nationwide strike by dealers and pumps are shut in every city except Islamabad and Rawalpindi,\" Abdul Sami Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA), told Reuters, adding that the strike is due to the government's decision to impose a 0.5% tax on dealers' turnover. Khan said it was too soon to give statistics on the number of pumps on strike. The Petroleum Ministry said in a statement that regulators and oil marketing companies (OMCs) have been advised to ensure that their sites remain operational with sufficient stocks of petroleum products to minimize the impact of strike. Oil tankers have been allowed to replenish stocks at retail sites during the day on Friday, as opposed to just at night, it added. \"The issue/concerns of PPDA have also been taken up with FBR and Finance Division for reviews/consideration,\" according to the ministry's statement. Several pumps have chosen to remain operational in the country as dealers remain divided on the call to strike and are hoping to strike out an understanding with the government over the taxes. \"We are not participating in the strike because we were not taken into confidence over this decision. We also have demands that the union should have looked into, but they did not,\" said Mohammad Khan, a fuel pump owner in the northwestern city of Dera Ismail Khan. Pakistan has set a tax revenue target of 13 trillion rupees ($47 billion) for the fiscal year that began on July 1, a near 40% jump from the prior year, and is aiming to bring down its fiscal deficit to 5.9% of gross domestic product from 7.4% the previous year. While the budget may win approval from the IMF, high taxes on a struggling economy could fuel public anger, according to analysts.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a forecast that could resonate well with the burgeoning green energy sector, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has projected that base metal prices will continue their upward trajectory in FY25, driven by an accelerating global shift towards sustainable energy and moderate demand growth from China. Coupled with potential supply disruptions, these factors have led Ind-Ra to maintain a neutral outlook on the base metals sector for the upcoming fiscal year. Shradha Saraogi Garg, Associate Director, India Ratings, said, \"While the continued sluggish global economic demand growth may dampen overall consumption growth, the strong continued pull from green energy is likely to limit downsides over the medium term, especially in the domestic market.\"Profitability within the sector is likely to improve in FY25 due to sustained high metal prices and continued cost rationalization efforts by metal producers, which are expected to lead to better spreads. However, Ind-Ra also warns of potential near-term downside risks to margins, which could stem from likely production disruptions and rebalancing of supply chains.Focusing on specific metals, Ind-Ra projects that copper prices will remain elevated in FY25, supported by growing investments in renewable power generation and electric vehicles. Although India will continue to be a net importer of copper, the domestic supply deficit is expected to improve after March 2024 when the Adani group&rsquo;s new copper smelting capacity becomes operational. The agency anticipates that the Treatment and Refining Charges (TC/RC) for copper will moderate year-over-year.For zinc, Ind-Ra expects the prices to stabilize around USD 2,500 per tonne in FY25. This stability is limited by an ongoing excess supply and modest demand growth in China, coupled with a subdued growth outlook for major economies. However, positive demand prospects in India, particularly from the auto sector and industrial capital expenditures, are expected to boost domestic zinc consumption.The outlook for aluminium is also positive with an expected year-on-year price increase in FY25, attributed to supply tightness and a weaker dollar. Despite this, the global aluminium market is forecasted to remain in surplus, as absolute production is anticipated to outpace consumption.On the coal front, Ind-Ra predicts that domestic coal availability will continue to improve in FY25, driven by the operationalization and ramp-up of commercially auctioned coal mines and enhancements in the efficiency and capacities of existing operational mines. The agency notes that the government's efforts to reduce imports of substitutable coal and planned additional infrastructure to support coal-based power plants will likely result in a gradual reduction in the share of imports in overall coal consumption.Overall, Ind-Ra's stable rating outlook for rated entities in the sector reflects expectations of healthy credit profiles in FY25, supported by stable cash generation. Despite anticipated continued negative free cash flow due to sustained high capital expenditure plans, key rated entities are expected to maintain adequate liquidity and benefit from strong financial flexibility and access to capital markets. Those with integrated operations, low-cost positions, and dominant market shares are considered better equipped to face potential industry headwinds.",

            "articleBody": "Beijing: The European Union will impose additional provisional duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese electric cars from Friday after concluding manufacturers in China benefited from unfair state support.Here's why the Chinese electric vehicle market has raised hackles among European policymakers -- and what impact the move could have:- How did China's EV sector get so strong? -China has spearheaded a targeted industrial strategy to boost its EV sector, pouring vast state funds into domestic firms as well as research and development.Between 2014 and the end of 2022, the Chinese government said it had spent more than 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) on subsidies and tax breaks for EV purchases alone.The approach has given Chinese firms a critical edge in the race to provide cheaper, more efficient EVs over leading European automakers, which have not always enjoyed such state largesse.They have also been boosted by surging domestic demand: Of all new EVs sold globally in December last year, 69 percent were in China, according to the research firm Rystad Energy.Exports are soaring. According to the Atlantic Council, Chinese sales of EVs abroad rose 70 percent in 2023, reaching $34.1 billion.Almost 40 percent went to the European Union, the largest recipient of Chinese EVs.The EU market share of Chinese-made EVs climbed from around three percent to more than 20 percent in the past three years, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.- Who are the key players? -The overwhelming market leader from China is BYD, which this year posted record annual profits for 2023 and says it aims to be among the top five car companies in Europe.Last year, it became the first manufacturer to pass the five million milestone in terms of hybrids and all-electric vehicles produced, cumulatively -- crowning itself as \"the world's leading manufacturer of new energy vehicles\".Among the other top Chinese EV makers exporting to Europe are SAIC, MG Motor and Polestar -- owned by Volvo and its Chinese parent firm Geely -- according to state media.- Why is the EU worried? -The surge in exports has allowed Chinese firms to rapidly increase their share of the EU market for EVs.The EU has now concluded that Chinese manufacturers benefited from \"unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury\" to European automakers.But there is also dissent within the EU -- Germany, a major trade partner whose car market is heavily reliant on China, warned tariffs would harm German companies.The EU will now impose provisional duties between 20 and 38 percent on top of the current 10 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars.Definitive duties will take effect in November for a period of five years, pending a vote by the EU's 27 states.- How has Beijing reacted? -Beijing has yet to react but a Chinese trade group condemned the bloc's \"protectionism\".China has already bared its teeth however, kickstarting an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports from the EU, threatening Spanish exports.In January, China launched an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the EU, in a move seen as targeting France, which had pushed for the commission's probe.Beijing said in June it \"reserves the right\" to file a case with the World Trade Organization over the EU tariffs.- How have car manufacturers reacted? -Since the EU's move will impact all Chinese-made electric cars, Tesla's Model 3, the electric Mini, and the Volvo EX40 are also among the vehicles that will face higher duties.A Tesla spokesperson said prices for the Model 3 -- the number three in electric car sales in Europe -- should increase \"in the short term\".China's electric car makers Nio and XPeng told AFP they had no plans to quit the European market after the announcement.Meanwhile, MG France said it already imported 2,600 electric vehicles from China that have cleared customs.- What impact will the tariffs have? -Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, alongside Austrian institutes, predicted the higher taxes will reduce vehicle imports from China by 42 percent.Electric car prices could rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 percent in the EU, they added.Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said costs for Chinese exporters of EVs and EU consumers would increase, and the duties would also hit the bloc's energy conservation and green development goals.",

            "articleBody": "Twice a year, the Reserve Bank of India reviews the stability of the country&rsquo;s financial system. Its latest report made for good headlines: The proportion of loans that have gone sour is at a multiyear low, and likely to decline further.But buried in the report is a warning from the very institutions the central bank is charged with regulating. Market participants responded to a survey asking what they saw as the biggest contributors to systemic risk. While they downplayed the usual concerns &mdash; asset quality, interest rate risk, capital outflows &mdash; one particular threat loomed larger than ever before: climate change. In fact, respondents named it for the first time as the greatest source of systemic risk to the Indian financial system.They&rsquo;re not wrong to worry. It isn&rsquo;t just that India, according to the Network for Greening the Financial System, will see sharply lower growth unless temperature rises are controlled. That growth will be more variable and subject to sharper shocks, including those from weird weather and delayed monsoons. This worries the country&rsquo;s financial arteries; so does the uncertain fate of sectors such as construction, cement and energy, to which they are deeply exposed.Indian regulators have been slow to respond. It wasn&rsquo;t until earlier this year that the RBI finally released a draft framework that would require financial institutions to devise and disclose their strategies to mitigate climate-related risk. Even then, the timeline for adopting the new rules was exceedingly generous. For regular Indian banks, they will only fully come into force for the financial year that ends in March 2028.What explains the lethargy? Part of the problem is no doubt the bureaucratic inertia that bedevils all policymaking in India. Regulators are scared of stepping on each other&rsquo;s toes, and on the government&rsquo;s.Nobody is sure, for example, who will eventually have the last word on what counts as &ldquo;green&rdquo; investment. The securities market regulator moved first to define a taxonomy and a reporting framework for large publicly traded companies. The finance ministry in New Delhi would naturally prefer that any such taxonomy be decided centrally.An inter-departmental task force, with various regulators and ministries represented, is supposedly working on definitions. But it was set up in 2021, and nothing has as yet been decided.At the same time, regulators may be too focused on reinventing the wheel. India&rsquo;s markets are large enough, and its problems pressing enough, that policymakers here generally believe they have little to learn from attempts made elsewhere to solve the same challenges.This is short-sighted, especially when it comes to financial regulation. Whether a taxonomy or disclosure requirements or climate stress tests, transparent criteria that align with those in use elsewhere are helpful &mdash; at least, if you want global investors to understand and trust your standards.Regulators might be more motivated to push through disclosures and restrictions &mdash; such as, for example, tagging specific loans as being at risk in the green transition &mdash; if they thought such transparency would attract greater investment.Unfortunately, Indian policymakers no longer entirely believe promises that a greener financial system will allow the country to access pools of sustainable finance globally. India launched a sovereign green bond in 2023. It didn&rsquo;t sell at much of a premium and was mostly taken up by domestic investors; interest from foreigners seemed low. The RBI canceled the sale of a second tranche scheduled for this year.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there may be an unspoken fear of what a more stringent examination of climate risk might reveal.The RBI released the results of a preliminary set of climate stress tests in 2023. They found that India&rsquo;s vast network of public sector banks was particularly vulnerable.While it&rsquo;s not exactly clear why &mdash; more granular tests have been promised but not conducted yet &mdash; the fact is that many of India&rsquo;s banks have lent heavily in the past to the energy sector. Data from last year showed that banks, even in the public sector, are now balking at financing new coal-fired power plants. That suggests they worry they are overexposed to the sector. (Renewables haven&rsquo;t faced the same problems.)Five years ago, Indian regulators may have been blissfully unaware that climate change posed macro-economic risks. They no longer have that excuse. The very report that identified climate change as a major problem also listed, in exhaustive detail, how other central banks and regulators are responding. The roadmap is there &mdash; India just needs to pick up the pace.",

            "articleBody": "The European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc. The higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month's time.  Here are some basic facts about the EU's planned customs duties:  What did the European Union do?  After an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs.  It announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won't need to be paid until they're confirmed by a vote of EU governments before November 2.  The EU will only collect the duties if there's a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them.  That gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.  The higher duties are not a goal in themselves but \"a means to correct an imbalance,\" commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. \"We certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.\"  The rates, if applied, would be: 17.4 per cent on cars from BYD, 19.9 per cent on those from Geely and 37.6 per cent for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC.  Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8 per cent.  The commission mentioned that Tesla might get an \"individually calculated\" rate if duties are definitively imposed.  Under EU rules it's possible - though at present it seems unlikely - that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the November 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a \"qualified majority\" of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65 per cent of the bloc's population.  Why did the commission take action?  Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9 per cent of the EV market in 2020 to 25 per cent by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.  The commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.  The rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.  Subsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers - an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.  Unusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.  How do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the US?  The Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100 per cent from the current 25 per cent. At that level, the US tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.  That's not what Europe is trying to do.  EU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent by 2030 - but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition  The planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.  European countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.  Just how cheap are Chinese EVs?  Chinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market.  BYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 Euros (USD 23,370) in China but 41,990 Euros (SUD 45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures.  The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around USD 10,000 in China.  What does this mean for European drivers and carmakers?  It's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices.  While consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.  Currently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains.  Five of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30 per cent tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.  The fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.  How is China likely to react?  Beijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them \"a naked act of protectionism.\"  On Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won't be made for four months.  \"It is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,\" he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.  He also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.  It's not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars.  China could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.  Over the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region.",

            "articleBody": "BERLIN: Germany's lower house of parliament has passed legal amendments allowing apartment owners and tenants to install solar systems on their balconies, as the country seeks to increase uptake of the energy form. The reforms, passed late on Thursday, allow what is referred to as a \"privileged measure\" in rental and property ownership law to allow plug-in solar devices, making it difficult for landlords and apartment-owner associations to block their installation without an exceptional justification. \"The right to harvest solar power is thus legally enshrined. This is tangible climate protection and is likely to further increase acceptance of the energy transition,\" Carsten Kornig, the head of the BSW solar power association, said in a statement. The changes are likely to have a particular impact in a country where more than half of the population live in rented accommodation and to help the capital Berlin achieve its goal of covering 80% of energy needs from renewable energy by 2030. They will apply to systems with a capacity of up to 2,000 watts that are frequently used to reduce households electricity bills, the economy ministry said, adding there would be no immediate need to change electricity meters. Following the energy price surge that followed Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the ending of Germany's dependency on Russian gas, Germany has increasingly turned to renewables. Demand for balcony solar systems, which typically cost between 500 and 1,500 euros ($541.25 and $1,623.75), surged last year. Some 550,000 devices are in operation, half of which were installed in 2023, data from the BSW solar power association showed.",

            "articleBody": "Representative ImageNEW DELHI: The cement sector has witnessed a muted growth of 2-3 per cent in the first quarter of current fiscal on account of a slowdown in construction activity because of the Lok Sabha polls, according to a report from rating agency Icra. However, the overall volumes for the FY2024-25 are likely to expand by 7-8 per cent driven by a healthy demand from the infrastructure and housing sectors.  \"Nevertheless, the government's focus on infrastructure projects, sanction of additional houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), and the industrial capex is expected to meaningfully improve cement volume offtake in H2 FY2025,\" it said.  The report also projects further consolidation in the cement industry by the top players to increase their capacity.  The sector has witnessed consolidation by leading players such as Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech Cement and Adani group firm Ambuja Cements.  Besides, the sector is also expected to continue its organic growth in the medium term as makers continue to invest to expand capacity.  \"While organic growth is expected to continue in the medium term, cement companies are also preferring the inorganic route to boost capacities rapidly,\" it said.  ICRA estimates that the market share of the top five cement companies witnessed a steep rise to 54 per cent as of March 2024 from 45 per cent as of March 2015.  Now it \"projects it to further increase to 58-59 per cent by March 2026, resulting in consolidation in the cement industry\", it said.  Moreover, the cement companies may also witness an improvement in their operating profit by 1-3 per cent due to softened raw materials prices.  \"While the cement prices are projected to largely sustain at previous-year levels, some softening of cost-side pressures - primarily power and fuel costs along with an increasing focus on green power, is likely to result in an improvement in OPBITDA/MT by 1-3 per cent YoY to Rs 975-1,000/MT,\" Icra Corporate Ratings Vice President and Co-Group Head Anupama Reddy said.  The Icra report also predicts an increase of green power by the cement manufacturers to a range of 40-42 per cent of the total power mix by March 2025 from 35 per cent as of March 2023.  \"Major cement players in the country aim to reduce their emissions by 15-17 per cent over the next 8-10 years by increasing the share of blended cement, which uses less clinker and consequently less fuel, boosting the share of green power consumption through a mix of solar, wind and waste heat recovery system (WHRS) capacities,\" it said.",

            "articleBody": "BRUSSELS: Hundreds of gigawatts of wind energy projects are waiting for permits to connect to Europe's power grid, a backlog that threatens to slow the shift to green energy, industry association WindEurope said on Friday.  WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Gaining access to the power grid is now the biggest hurdle to Europe's expansion of renewable energy, WindEurope said. With Europe's power networks upgraded too slowly to absorb more capacity, and sluggish grid-permitting procedures in many countries, some projects face waiting times of up to nine years to receive a permit. \"The system is clogged up - and holding back hundreds of gigawatts of wind farms,\" WindEurope CEO Giles Dickson said.  BY THE NUMBERS European wind energy projects with a total of more than 500 gigawatts of potential capacity are waiting for an answer to their requests for grid connections, across countries including France, Germany, Ireland, Poland and Spain, the data published on Friday showed. Italy and the UK each have more than 100 GW of potential projects awaiting grid connection assessments. The EU has a target to derive 42.5% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. That implies expanding wind power capacity to 425 GW by 2030, up from 220 GW today.  WHAT'S NEXT The queue of wind projects is at various stages and not all are likely to be built. For example, some are competing against one another for subsidies, WindEurope said. Part of the problem is that projects are assessed on a \"first come, first served\" basis when they apply, meaning the most mature projects - those most likely to go ahead - cannot jump the queue. Europe's energy industry has urged governments to spur investments in expanding grids to prepare for a bigger influx of renewable power, and filter applications so that projects that are ready to launch receive permits fast.

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The All India Power Engineers' Federation (AIPEF) on Thursday urged Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar to end privatisation and deploy qualified engineers in top management of the corporations to make the country self-reliant in the power sector. An AIPEF delegation led by its chairman Shailendra Dubey submitted a memorandum to the power minister, raising various issues concerning the sector, a statement said.  It said that in the larger interest of the energy sector and electricity consumers, the proposal for Electricity (Amendment) Bill should not be brought now.  Also, the failed experiment of privatisation and urban distribution franchise like in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, should be withdrawn, it added.  It also demanded that in view of the continuously increasing production of coal, instructions to the power generation houses to import coal compulsorily should be withdrawn.  The body also said that to make the energy sector strong and self-reliant, expert power engineers should be posted to top management positions in all the power corporations of the country.  Besides Chairman, the delegation included Secretary General P Ratnakar Rao, Chief Patron Padamjit Singh, Satyapal, Yashpal Sharma, Prashant Chaturvedi and AK Jain.  The memorandum stated that the main objective of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill is to give licences to private houses in the field of electricity distribution and allow them to use the networks of public sector electricity distribution companies. Notably, it was not mandatory for private sector power houses to provide electricity to all categories of consumers.  AIPEF alleged that private sector companies would use the network of government discoms to provide electricity to profitable industrial and commercial consumers, which would worsen the financial condition of the government sector.  The memorandum stated that Urban Distribution Franchise was experimented in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and some other states but this experiment was a complete failure and the agreements of most of the franchises have been cancelled.  Similarly, the entire electricity distribution sector in Odisha was privatised. This experiment also failed miserably and all the licences of Reliance Power were cancelled in 2015, it stated.  Again in 2020, the entire distribution area in Odisha was given to Tata Power. Despite this, there has been no significant improvement, it stated.  Therefore, it demanded withdrawal of these failed experiments.  AIPEF noted that Coal India's production is continuously increasing. Coal India also claims that there is enough coal available for thermal power plants in the country.  In such a situation, AIPEF said it is not appropriate to make it mandatory to import coal for thermal power plants and the government's order in this regard should be withdrawn.  Recently, through an order, the Union Ministry of Power extended the order to import 4 per cent coal till October 2024.  AIPEF also noted that if cheap electricity is to be provided to the common consumers, then generation companies of states will have to be further strengthened and they will have to give new projects in more quantity.  Apart from this, it demanded review of the 25-year \"expensive\" power purchase agreements made with private houses, and said power distribution companies of states should be allowed to review such PPAs.",

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: Rows of what look like thin, white shipping containers are lined up on a barren dirt field in China's Shandong province. Filled with batteries, they form a 795 megawatt (MW) plant that can hold up to 1 million kilowatt-hours of electricity - enough to power 150,000 households for a day, making it China's largest such storage facility when it was connected to the grid last Saturday. Built by Lijin County Jinhui New Energy Co, the project is part of an explosion in development of energy storage in China, which has called for even more investment in the sector to boost renewable electricity and ease grid bottlenecks. While the state-led drive has provided a welcome spark for home-grown battery giants such as CATL and BYD, some industry insiders and experts say pricing reforms and technology improvements are needed for a storage sector whose rapid growth has been plagued by low utilisation and losses for operators. \"Most of the players in this sector are trying to figure out how to make money,\" said Rystad Energy senior analyst Simeng Deng. Investment in grid-connected batteries in China surged 364% last year to 75 billion yuan ($11 billion), according to Carbon Brief, creating by far the world's largest storage fleet at 35.3 GW as of March. In May, China set a new target of at least 40GW of battery storage installed by the end of 2025, up 33% from the previous goal under a wider plan to reduce carbon emissions. Storage is critical to help balance supply and demand when wind and solar farms produce more renewable electricity than the grid's distribution system can handle, or when a lack of sun or wind means they are generating too little power. To meet Beijing's targets, local governments have required renewable energy plants to build storage, driving rapid capacity growth. However, highly regulated power markets have struggled to incentivise usage, particularly at solar and wind facilities, leading China's cabinet to call for research into improving price mechanisms. Energy storage at renewables plants operated just 2.18 hours a day last year, while independent facilities operated only 2.61 hours per day, according to the China Electricity Council. By comparison, storage at industrial and commercial plants operated 14.25 hours per day. Policy mandates requiring renewables plants to install storage have failed because they add to project costs and often sit idle, said Cosimo Ries, an analyst at Trivium China. \"Because power prices are not flexible enough during different hours, these projects just can't really make money,\" Ries said.  BIG BUILD The stakes are high for China, which leads the world in adoption of energy transition technology, and for its battery giants, which are seeing faster growth in batteries for storage than for cars as electric vehicle sales growth slows. While government mandates are a key driver of China's storage boom, big power users such as industrial parks and EV charging stations are also driving adoption. China, where 60% of the world's electric vehicles are sold, has worried about the effects of EVs on its power grid, and storage can help smooth demand spikes. Falling battery prices are improving the economics of storage in China, with costs for batteries used in standard energy storage down by about a fifth between the end of 2023 and mid-June, according to consultancy Shanghai Metals Market. Also, expanding adoption of \"peak-valley pricing\", which discourages electricity use during peak demand times by raising prices, gives storage providers more chance to profit by selling stored power when they can charge more. That has led to intraday price differentials of up to 0.9 yuan per kwh in coastal provinces like Guangdong, where the peak price of 1.1868 yuan/kwh is more than four times the low, enough to incentivise use of both battery and pumped hydro storage, said Alex Whitworth, head of Asia Pacific power research at Wood Mackenzie. Pumped hydro is an established technology with more than 60% greater capacity than battery storage in China, but with geographical limitations and long lead times. Investor returns on solar-plus-storage projects are also improving as solar module prices fall, making renewables-plus-storage \"financially feasible in most parts of China\" with internal rates of return meeting the minimum investment hurdle rate of at least 8%, wrote Pierre Lau, a Citi analyst. Further market reform is needed to incentivise battery storage, industry players say, with storage operators calling for wider use of capacity payments similar to those meant to keep struggling coal plants online, with costs shouldered by customers.  BETTER BATTERIES Battery technology is also improving. The vast new Shandong plant incorporates both lithium ion and vanadium redox flow batteries, according to a report by local state media. Vanadium is a newer technology that promises longer storage times and improved safety. While the economics of lithium ion batteries are expected to improve, experts say most current technology is suitable for shorter storage durations of four hours or less, and some say it is best used in smaller-scale applications. Fire risk remains a concern, particularly with lower-quality batteries, experts say. Emerging technologies such as thermal energy storage, redox flow batteries, and sodium ion batteries have shown promise for longer-duration storage but have higher up-front costs, with technology and supply chains that are less mature. China is hedging its bets by increasing its pipeline of pumped hydro projects - which can take five to seven years to build - and encouraging demonstration projects in emerging technologies.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: China's record-breaking deployment of wind and solar capacity has worsened regional power imbalances, forcing the country to idle increasing amounts of renewable generation when it overwhelms local consumption. New government regulations aim to reduce the amount of renewable generation that has to be abandoned by increasing long-distance transmission links and better coordinating generation plans across provinces. Since the end of 2018, China's total generating capacity has increased by 1.137 billion kilowatts (kW), compound annual growth of 9%, according to data from the National Bureau of statistics (NBS). Thermal capacity, mainly from coal-fired plants but some from gas-fired generators, rose by 257 million kW or 4% per year (\"China statistical yearbook\", NBS, 2023). Most capacity additions, however, have come from what the government calls \"new energy sources\" - wind farms (277 million kW, 19% per year) and solar generators (517 million kW, 29% per year). Increased penetration of intermittent renewables is making it harder to manage a nationwide transmission system that was already struggling with large regional imbalances between generation and load. The solution to variable wind and solar output is to smooth out fluctuations across a larger number of generators spread over much larger areas of the country, which will require more transmission and better scheduling.  LONG-DISTANCE TRANSMISSION For decades, the country has been characterised by massive west-to-east electricity transfers from interior areas with surplus generation to the massive load centres on the east and south coasts. Ten provincial-level areas in the east and south (Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong) accounted for 50% of national consumption but only 40% of generation in 2022. By contrast, six remote and sparsely populated northern and western areas (Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia) accounted for 18% of consumption but 25% of generation.  Chartbook: China regional electricity transfers  In response, China's State Grid Corporation has constructed a network of ultra-high voltage transmission lines to move power thousands of kilometres from surplus areas in the west and north to deficit areas in the east and south. In the process, China has become the world leader in ultra-high voltage transmission to move electricity over long distances while minimising line losses, and is exporting its expertise around the world.  INNER ASIA'S ENERGY ABUNDANCE China's northern and western areas are some of the least populated and poorest parts of the country, but rich in energy resources, traditionally coal but now increasingly gas and renewables. The north and west contains the country's most important coal deposits and has become a major centre of pit-head generation, with some electricity used locally by heavy industry, and the rest transmitted east and south. Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Xinjiang alone accounted for 81% of coal mine production and 25% of all thermal generation in 2022, according to data from the NBS. In a quirk of fate, the arid and windswept northern and western plains and deserts are also the best sites for giant wind farms and solar parks. Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Xinjiang together with neighbouring Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai accounted for 42% of all wind and solar generation last year. But the addition of so much wind and solar generation in a region already saturated with coal-fired power threatens to overwhelm the transmission system. During peak periods of wind and solar generation, there is not enough population and industry in these areas to absorb all the output, and not enough long-distance transmission capacity to move the surplus east and south.  MORE TRANSMISSION AND PLANNING In 2016, the national utilisation rate for new energy sources fell to a record low of 84%, prompting the central government to launch a \"Clean Energy Absorption Action Plan\" to reduce the waste of renewable resources. The plan focused on improvements in local distribution, long-distance inter-provincial transmission, and energy trading to reduce the curtailment of new energy generation. By 2023, the utilisation rate for wind power had climbed to a remarkable 97.3% and solar had reached 98%, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. With rapid deployment of renewable capacity, however, the problem of abandonment is re-emerging, with wind utilisation down to 96.1% and solar down to 96% in the first five months of 2024. Sliding utilisation has prompted an alert from the National New Energy Consumption Monitoring and Early Warning Center (\"Solving the pain points and difficulties of new energy consumption\", Xinhua, July 1, 2024). The response is likely to be similar, with renewed emphasis on integrating renewables at local level and more transmission capacity to move surplus power across provincial boundaries. In the last two years, central government policy statements have repeatedly focused on the need for better coordination of transmission and generation between provinces.  CREATING A TRULY NATIONAL SYSTEM In a sign of the importance attached to the issue, the Communist Party's Politburo held a group study session on new energy technology and energy security on Feb. 29, 2024. The session, bringing together top central and regional leaders, included a discussion on boosting \"the grid's capacity capability to integrate, distribute and regulate clean energy.\" President Xi Jinping stressed need for \"coordinated development of the energy sector\" (\"Xi stresses high-quality development of new energy\", CPC International Department, March 2, 2024). In many ways, China's long-distance UVDC transmission system is an extraordinary engineering achievement, likely to be copied in other parts of the world as more and more renewables are connected to grids. It has enabled a remarkable penetration of intermittent renewables, as well as hydroelectric generation, into the national power system while maintaining or improving reliability. As a result, wind and solar producers supplied 15% of all generation in the first five months of 2024, up from 7% in the same period in 2019. In some ways, however, China is still struggling to forge a truly integrated nationwide system from fragmented provincial-level utilities that pursue their own priorities. If government plans to achieve even higher renewables penetration are to be achieved, there will have to be much closer links and more coordination between different types of generators and across far wider areas.By John Kemp",

            "articleBody": "SINGAPORE: Norway is seeking to form a stronger partnership with Indonesia and explore investment opportunities in renewable energy such as hydropower, and carbon capture and storage, the energy minister said. \"A lot of opportunities are there, and there are some hurdles, but I hope we can build a stronger partnership in years to come,\" Energy Minister Terje Aasland told Reuters late on Thursday after meeting his counterpart Arifin Tasrif in Jakarta earlier this week. While Norway aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, it also continues to explore and develop new oil and gas fields, including in the Arctic's Barents Sea, to maintain output that is expected to peak in 2025. The country became Europe's largest supplier of natural gas after a sharp reduction in Russian deliveries since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022. Norwegian companies can contribute their experience in hydropower and carbon capture and storage (CCS) in Indonesia to reduce emissions in the country, Aasland said. Storage capacity at Norway's first CCS project Northern Lights will be ready this year, and is on track to start capturing carbon dioxide from a cement plant in Brevik next May, he said. Aasland met representatives from Norwegian firms in Singapore on Thursday including Equinor, DNB and Yarra, which are investing in renewables, energy storage and alternative fuels such as ammonia in Asia Pacific. Norway, which is western Europe's largest oil and gas producer, generates a total output of just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd). Norwegian gas supplies to Europe is expected to reach 120 billion cubic metres (bcm) this year, Aasland said, up from 109 bcm in 2023. \"Oil and gas will also play a crucial role in the coming decades because of the needs to energy security and affordable prices,\" Aasland said, adding that the country needs to secure supply chain for green transition. Norway aims to give exploration permits for seabed mining in the Arctic region next year, hoping to extract minerals needed for solar panels, wind turbines and electric car batteries needed to replace fossil fuel energy, although the plan faces opposition from environmental groups and some European countries. \"Today we depend on Russia and China so we have to diversify the value chain for minerals in the coming years and we are looking into how we can develop the activity in the Norwegian Continental Shelf in a sustainable manner,\" Aasland added.",

            "articleBody": "MOSCOW: Russia's oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil will sharply cut oil exports from the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk in July, two sources familiar with a loading plan said, as the companies resumed operations at their refineries. Combined Novorossiisk oil loadings by Rosneft and Lukoil in July will fall by some 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared to last month, Reuters calculations based on market data showed. Last week Russian government decided to continue with unrestricted gasoline exports in July, extending the waiver for a partial ban on overseas fuel sales, as Russia's domestic oil plants produce enough oil products to meet peak seasonal demand despite a spate of Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries. Rosneft oil exports from Novorossiisk are set to fall to 0.62 million metric tons in July from 1.06 million tons in June, while its Tuapse refinery is set to resume crude runs this month. Lukoil's exports from the port will fall to 0.19 million tons in July from 0.58 million tons last month, sources said. Lukoil restarted a key piece of equipment for oil processing, the CDU-6 crude distillation unit, at its NORSI refinery, Russia's fourth-largest, following a drone attack in March. Rosneft and Lukoil did not reply to Reuters requests for comments. Novorossiisk total oil loadings in July were set at 1.8 million tons, down from 2.9 million tons in June. Russia's overall oil exports and transit from its western ports in July are expected to decline from June amid higher refinery runs and Moscow's pledge to stick to OPEC+ output cuts. ",

According to Kush, CEO, Essar Power, Union Budget 2024 is anticipated to offer strategic initiatives that would drive growth and sustainability.&ldquo;We hope to see significant allocations towards renewable energy projects, enhanced grid infrastructure, and innovative technologies. Additionally, policy reforms aimed at reducing regulatory bottlenecks and promoting private investment will be crucial,&rdquo; he said.Kush added that these measures would not only help in meeting the growing energy demands but also in achieving the nation's ambitious targets for a greener and more resilient energy future.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the full Union Budget on 24 July 2024 at 11 am with the Economic Survey set to be tabled in Parliament on 23 July 2024.Alessandro Des Dorides, CEO, Nayara Energy said that India, being the fastest growing economies in the world, has a high energy demand, and there is a need to encourage investments in expanding refining and petrochemical capacities.&ldquo;We anticipate a budget that prioritizes the energy security of the nation&hellip; Offering tax incentives, supporting faster clearances, facilitating land acquisition will encourage both domestic and foreign investments,&rdquo; he said. He added that investment schemes for the petrochemical industry will enhance the country&rsquo;s self-sufficiency and promote substantial investment.&ldquo;The government has set a target of 20 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol or gasoline by 2025 and the early success of the program has well-positioned India on a sustainable growth path&hellip; This should be continued,&rdquo; he added.To further accelerate India&rsquo;s transition towards a low-carbon economy the government could consider incentivising users to replace gray hydrogen with green hydrogen, providing incentives for corporates to fund R&amp;D, and developing centralised or shared renewable energy storage systems, he added.According to Pankaj Kalra, CEO, Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, with economic activities on the rise and considering the geo-political scenario, the demand for oil and gas is expected to remain stronger for longer. &ldquo;As the country has plans to raise the share of gas in the energy mix to 15 per cent, we foresee that the upcoming Union Budget prioritizes policy frameworks and measures for the oil and gas sector,&rdquo; he said. Kalra said that addressing the tax structure in this sector is imperative as natural gas, crude oil, and other petroleum products remain outside the GST ambit, leading to an increasing demand for their inclusion in the GST regime. The government&rsquo;s policy reforms can significantly strengthen the energy sector and ensure stability amidst volatile global crude markets. We aim this upcoming budget will focus on growth, collaboration between industry stakeholders and policymakers will be crucial ones for incessant development, he added.",

            "articleBody": "Britain, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, erstwhile coal-burning imperial behemoth, wants to be a &ldquo;clean energy superpower.&rdquo;At least that&rsquo;s the promise of the man poised to be the next prime minister, Keir Starmer. His Labour Party was projected to win the parliamentary elections Thursday, ending 14 years of Conservative Party rule.Labour made big campaign promises on climate. How that actually plays out will be felt not only in the daily lives of people in Britain, but also on the nation&rsquo;s standing in the world.Britain is one of history&rsquo;s major climate polluters. It&rsquo;s where the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, giving rise to a global economy driven by coal, oil and gas and with it, the emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases. So the speed and scale of Britain&rsquo;s energy transition is likely to be closely watched by other industrialized countries and emerging economies alike.Britain likes to think of itself as a global climate leader. In 2008, it became the first among major industrialized countries to pass a climate change law. Its emissions have dramatically fallen since then. In 2021, its government set a legally binding target to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by 78% by 2035, relative to 1990 levels, in one of the most ambitious climate laws in the world.Getting there, though, is the hard part. The new government will face a cost-of-living crisis at home, geopolitical turbulence abroad and a battery of extreme weather events exacerbated by the rise in fossil-fuel emissions.Here are three things to watch as the new government gets to work.What will it take to pivot away from fossil fuels? Starmer&rsquo;s campaign manifesto promised &ldquo;zero-carbon electricity by 2030.&rdquo;Lucky for him, the country is already on its way there.It no longer counts on coal to generate the bulk of its electricity. The last coal-burning power plant is slated to shut down in September. Coal has gone from supplying 40% of its electricity in 2012 to near zero today, according to an analysis by Carbon Brief, an independent climate news site.The challenge now is to reduce reliance on gas. In 2023, it supplied a little over 30% of Britain&rsquo;s electricity. The government must reduce that to zero by 2030, or find ways to capture and bury the greenhouse gases that gas plants produce.Labour Party leaders have also said they would double wind capacity on land, quadruple wind capacity offshore and triple solar power.Joss Garman, executive director at the European Climate Foundation, called the zero-carbon-electricity promise a &ldquo;stretch goal&rdquo; that would require changing the laws of the approval of wind and solar projects.What&rsquo;s the future of North Sea oil?Oil extraction in the North Sea has steadily declined over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to drop through midcentury.Still, the question of oil and gas licenses in the North Sea is politically charged.Last year, the incumbent Conservative Party prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said Britain should &ldquo;max out&rdquo; North Sea oil and gas. He put in place a system to issue new licenses, prompting the resignation of a former energy minister, who said it would cause &ldquo;future harm.&rdquo;Starmer&rsquo;s party has said it would honor the existing licenses but refrain from issuing new ones.Oil and gas companies already face a 75% tax in Britain. The incoming Labour government has said it would slightly increase that to 78%.There&rsquo;s another wrinkle, and that&rsquo;s Scotland.Scottish nationalists have pressed for a greater say over North Sea oil and gas, because it&rsquo;s in Scottish waters. The decline of production there is likely to be felt first and most acutely by communities along Scotland&rsquo;s northeastern coast, which depend on the industry for jobs.Will climate action remain polarizing? Unlike in the United States, there was broad political consensus in Britain around the need to address climate change. In fact, climate action was a conservative darling.Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the alarm on climate change. Theresa May, also a conservative prime minister, led the charge for a net-zero target by 2050, which means that Britain, by law, must take out as much greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere as the country injects into it by midcentury. In 2021, Boris Johnson&rsquo;s government pledged to reduce emissions by 78% by 2035.Recently, that goal has changed. Sunak cast the green transition as too costly. For example, what was to be a 2030 ban on new petroleum and diesel-powered cars was pushed back to 2035.Starmer is likely to restore the 2030 deadline. He has also promised to double funding for energy efficiency programs and create a new national energy company that he says will cut energy bills.At the same time, there&rsquo;s pressure from the far-right Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, to drop the net-zero-by-2050 target altogether.

ADB was the mandated lead arranger for the entire loan totalling Rs 14.6 billion (approximately USD 175.9 million) with ADB and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank both providing Rs 7.3 billion, the Manila-based multilateral funding agency said in a statement.  The project will support the Government of India's target of achieving at least 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030.  \"The private sector's engagement in the fight against climate change is pivotal for achieving a clean energy transition in Asia and the Pacific,\" said ADB Director General for Private Sector Operations Suzanne Gaboury.  This project exemplifies how ADB, as the region's climate bank, supports the private sector in developing renewable energy projects through long-term local currency financing typically unavailable in local capital markets, the statement said.  This is the second project that ADB has financed for the ENGIE group in India, following the financing of the group's flagship project in the country in 2020, and exemplifies our focus on mobilizing long-term financing from partner organizations.  The solar panels will be constructed using locally produced bifacial photovoltaic power modules, thereby diversifying the solar module supply chain and supporting India-based manufacturers, it said.  The plant will generate an average of 805 gigawatt-hours annually over the next 25 years, avoiding nearly 662,441 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year, it said.",

The Centre was urged to remove such blocks from the list of coal blocks put for auction by the Ministry of Coal.CM Reddy mentioned that Telangana has 51 per cent share in SCCL while the remaining 49 per cent is held by the Central government.The Prime Minister was urged to remove Sravanapalli mine from the coal blocks put for auction.The state government also sought allotment of Koyagudem and Sattupalli block 3 for SCCL, saying this is crucial to meet the coal requirements of power plants in Telangana.The Prime Minister was informed that in 2010 the then UPA government had sanctioned ITIRs for Hyderabad and Bengaluru.To encourage new IT companies and developers, the Telangana government had identified lands for three clusters. However, the ITIR project made no progress after 2014.CM Reddy urged the Prime Minister to revive the same.CM Reddy also brought to PM Modi's notice that though the Centre had decided in principle to set up an Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in every state, Telangana had not yet been sanctioned an IIM.Demanding immediate sanction of IIM for Hyderabad, he said there was land available in Hyderabad Central University. He also conveyed that the state government was ready to allot alternate land if needed.CM Reddy reminded PM Modi that at the time of reorganisation of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana was promised a railway coach factory at Kazipet. However, in July 2023 the Railway Ministry announced that in place of the coach factory, it would set up a periodical overhauling workshop at Kazipet.He said it was not proper on part of the Railway Ministry to announce that a railway factory in Kazipet was not possible while it sanctioned coach factories for other parts of the country.CM Reddy also requested the Prime Minister to include Telangana in the India Semiconductor Mission. He mentioned that some companies have evinced interest in setting up semiconductor fabs in Hyderabad.The Chief Minister also brought to the Prime Minister's notice that Telangana was sanctioned fewer houses under the Prime Minister Awas Yojana.As the Central government has set a target of 3 crore houses under PMAY starting from 2024-25, Telangana may be sanctioned 25 lakh houses, he requested.The Prime Minister was also requested to release arrears of Rs.1,800 crore to Telangana under Backward Regions Grant Fund for the years from 2019-20 to 2023-34.CM Reddy also sought transfer of Defence land in Hyderabad to the state government for elevated corridors on Hyderabad-Karimnagar and Hyderabad-Nagpur highways.He also sought transfer of another 2,450 acres of Defence land for widening of roads and other infrastructure projects in Hyderabad.CM Reddy conveyed to PM Modi that in lieu of these Defence lands, the state government is ready to transfer to the Centre 2,462 acres of land given on lease for Research Centre Imarat (RCI) at Ravirala.The Chief Minister urged the Centre to expedite setting up of Bayyaram Steel Plant as promised under the Reorganisation Act.The state government also requested the Centre to initiate the tender process for the Hyderabad Regional Ring Road (RRR north), which was already approved under Bharatmala Pariyojana's first phase. It demanded that RRR (south) be declared a national highway and approved under Bharatmala Pariyojana.The Prime Minister was urged to upgrade 13 state highways as national highways given the increased transport demand to important towns and pilgrimage centres.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal announced significant concessions in licensing fees for women entrepreneurs and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) during a Stakeholder Consultation in New Delhi. Organized by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the consultation aimed to enhance the efficiency of the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO).Goyal stated that the compliance of the petroleum and explosives industry must be balanced with public safety. He announced an 80 per cent concession for women entrepreneurs and a 50 per  cent concession for MSMEs in licensing fees for licenses granted by PESO. This initiative is expected to bolster the participation of women and small businesses in these sectors.The Minister directed PESO to formulate guidelines in consultation with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) for creating a template of safety measures. These guidelines will allow retail outlets of petrol pumps to function where there is habitation within 30-50 metres.Goyal also announced that QR codes for cylinders are incorporated in the draft Gas Cylinders Rules (GCR), with the final notification to be issued soon. He directed the formation of a committee to examine the feasibility of extending the validity of licenses for explosives, transport, and manufacturing to ten years.Efforts must be made to involve Third Party Inspection Agencies (TPIAs) in more areas, Goyal emphasized. He said that online permission modules would be developed by PESO for the areas still managed offline. The Minister also stressed the need to expedite the process of filling up vacancies in PESO.Petrol pump licenses are issued in Form XIV of the Petroleum Rules 2002, while licenses for CNG dispensing facilities within petroleum retail outlets are issued in Form G of the Gas Cylinders Rules. Amendments to the Form XIV license will be made to streamline the process for CNG facilities within the same petrol pump, reducing compliance burdens and the workload of PESO.During the consultation, Goyal emphasized the need for simplification of processes and approvals in PESO. He directed officers to strictly adhere to timelines for clearing applications and to issue FAQs for different approvals and licenses. He also stated that No Objection Certificates (NOCs) by District Authorities should be issued through the Licensing System for District Authority (LSDA) online system.The Minister responded to industry suggestions by directing MoPNG and concerned industry associations to form committees to develop detailed recommendations. These committees will study and propose best practices and standards. DPIIT was instructed to form a committee comprising industry representatives, PESO officers, DPIIT officers, CPCB, MoPNG, and oil companies to work on the suggested reforms in a time-bound manner.The consultation brought together over 150 stakeholders from various sectors, including representatives from the Federation of Agrivalue Chain Manufacturers and Exporters (FAME), Explosives Manufacturers Welfare Association (EMWA), Indian Ammonium Nitrate Manufacturers Association (IANMA), and All India Industrial Gas Manufacturers Association (AIIGMA). These industry associations highlighted critical areas for regulatory improvement and operational enhancement.Recommendations were made to enhance digitalization and transparency through the PESO online portal, ensuring quick responses to inquiries and timely issuance of NOCs and licenses.PESO, a subordinate office under DPIIT, administers regulatory frameworks established under the Explosives Act, 1884, and the Petroleum Act, 1934. In recent years, PESO has undertaken significant reforms, including the introduction of a paperless licensing system, adherence to strict approval timelines, and the integration of Third Party Inspection Agencies, all aimed at simplifying compliance procedures and enhancing safety standards.The stakeholder consultation underscored a collaborative effort towards fostering a conducive regulatory environment in the petroleum and explosives sectors. DPIIT remains committed to reducing compliance burdens, promoting ease of doing business, and safeguarding industry standards across the nation. The Ministry highlighted ongoing initiatives to adopt a risk-based approach to regulation, capacity building for regulatory bodies, and enhanced digital transformation as key priorities moving forward.",

However, 2024 saw a rise of 21.3 per cent to 81.53 &micro;g/m&sup3;. Concurrently, Delhi's average temperature decreased from 32.15&deg;C in 2022 to 28.72&deg;C in 2023, before increasing by 11 per cent to 31.87&deg;C in 2024.Kolkata experienced a 28 per cent increase in PM2.5 levels from 26.50 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2022 to 33.93 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2023, followed by an 11.3 per cent decrease to 30.10 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2024. The city's temperature remained stable from 2022 to 2023, with a slight decrease from 30.28&deg;C to 30.27&deg;C, and then rose by 2.5 per cent to 31.04&deg;C in 2024.Patna showed fluctuations in both PM2.5 levels and average temperature. PM2.5 levels decreased from 2022 to 2023, followed by a significant rise in 2024. Similarly, temperature trends showed a decrease from 2022 to 2023 and an increase in 2024.In Lucknow, PM2.5 levels decreased by 27.7 per cent from 73.16 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2022 to 52.87 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2023, then increased by 17.6 per cent to 62.17 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2024. Temperature trends also showed a decrease from 2022 to 2023 and a subsequent increase in 2024, suggesting a strong influence of temperature changes on air quality.Mumbai's temperature slightly decreased from 29.55&deg;C in 2022 to 29.42&deg;C in 2023, and further to 29.20&deg;C in 2024. PM2.5 levels were 43.17 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2022, which decreased to 30.84 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2023, and slightly further to 30.46 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2024.The study utilized data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for PM2.5 concentrations and temperature data from the ERA5 dataset, covering April and May for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. The analysis indicated that meteorological parameters significantly influence PM2.5 concentrations.Dr. Palak Balyan, Research Lead at Climate Trends, stated, &ldquo;PM2.5 concentration can be influenced by various factors, including temperature. Extreme temperatures can enhance the photochemical reactions that can lead to the formation of various secondary pollutants, while also influencing atmospheric stability and pollutant dispersion. So while we are alarmed by the record-breaking levels of air pollution in the winter months, the pollution in the summer months could harm us in different ways. Understanding the interplay between PM2.5 levels and temperature is crucial for developing effective air quality management and public health protection strategies.\"Dr. Harshal Salve, Additional Professor of Community Medicine at AIIMS New Delhi, commented, &ldquo;High levels of pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 can exacerbate respiratory conditions, trigger asthma attacks, and lead to cardiovascular problems. We already see vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly, exhibiting heightened signs of these during the winter months, its burden during summer further adds to the risk. Heat waves increase dust pollution adding to the double whammy. Policymakers must undertake measures that reduce sources of air pollution throughout the year and not just mask them during the winter months. Climate and health co-benefits of air pollution mitigation must be considered while ideating and implementing policies.&rdquo;The report concludes that PM2.5 concentrations across the studied cities consistently exceed national standards throughout most days in April and May from 2022 to 2024. The findings underscore regional temperature variations and provide essential insights into climate dynamics and heat patterns during these months in urban centers. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for formulating effective pollution control strategies and safeguarding public health.",

            "articleBody": "Berlin: German auto giant Volkswagen on Thursday said EU moves to impose provisional extra duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese electric car imports over subsidy concerns were \"detrimental\" to the European market.\"Countervailing duties are generally not suitable for strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry in the long term -- we reject them,\" Volkswagen said in a statement.Brussels announced the planned tariff hike last month at the conclusion of an investigation into Chinese state subsidies for electric vehicle makers potentially undercutting European manufacturers.But auto groups in Germany responded negatively to the EU action against China, where many of them have significant business interests.\"The timing of the EU Commission's decision is detrimental\" to the European electric car market, where demand was weak, Volkswagen said. Europe's largest carmaker said the \"negative effects of this decision outweigh any potential benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry\". BMW chief Oliver Zipse said the tariff battle between the EU and China \"leads to a dead end\".\"It does not strengthen the competitiveness of European manufacturers. On the contrary: it harms the business model of globally active companies,\" Zipse said in a statement.The move to increase the price of Chinese imports also \"limits the supply of electric cars to European customers and can therefore even slow down decarbonisation in the transport sector\", Zipse said.The provisional duties on Chinese manufacturers included a 17.4 percent tax for market major BYD, which has recently turned its attention to the European market, as well as a 19.9 percent mark up for Geely and 37.6 percent for SAIC.The increase will kick in from Friday, with definitive duties to take effect in November for a period of five years, pending a vote by the EU's 27 member states.Germany's VDA auto industry association said there was a \"real risk of escalation in the trade conflict with China\" if the EU pushed ahead with the tariff rises.\"Chinese countermeasures could severely hit the European economy\", especially sectors with large exports to China, the VDA said. The industry association called on the EU to cancel the tariff increases and find a \"negotiated solution\" with Beijing. ",

            "articleBody": "Astana: Climate change is a prominent concern before the world today and India is working towards achieving committed reduction in emissions and building climate-resilient infrastructure, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. Jaishankar was delivering Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit here in the Kazakh capital.  \"Delivered India's statement at the Summit of SCO Council of Heads of States on behalf of PM Shri @narendramodi ji. Thank the leaders present for conveying their best wishes to Prime Minister @narendramodi on his re-election for a third successive term,\" Jaishankar posted on X along with photos.  \"We are working towards achieving a committed reduction in emissions, including transition to alternate fuels, adoption of electric vehicles, and building climate-resilient infrastructure,\" he said.  \"In this context, during India's SCO presidency, a Joint Statement on emerging fuels, and a Concept Paper on de-carbonization in the transportation sector were approved,\" Jaishankar added.  During last year's annual climate conference, Prime Minister Modi said India has already declared to achieve Net Zero by 2070. It plans to reduce emissions intensity by 45 per cent by 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuel to 50 per cent.  The remarks also pointed out how economic development requires robust connectivity. \"That can also pave the way for cooperation and trust between our societies,\" Jaishankar said.  \"Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity is essential for connectivity and infrastructure projects. So too are non-discriminatory trade rights and transit regimes,\" he said, and asserted: \"The SCO needs to deliberate seriously on these aspects.\"  Jaishankar also reminded the audience that the SCO needs to make \"technology creative\" and apply it to the welfare and progress of societies.  \"India is among the countries to formulate a National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence and the launch of an AI Mission. Our commitment to 'AI for All' is also reflected in working within the SCO framework on a Roadmap on AI cooperation,\" he added.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: With an eye on reducing harmful emissions and cutting fuel costs for consumers, the Indian Auto LPG Coalition (IAC) has reached out to Union Cabinet Minister for Road Transport &amp; Highways Nitin Gadkari, to promote Auto LPG as a primary component of India's clean fuel strategy. The IAC emphasized that Auto LPG, being approximately 40% cheaper than petrol and emitting fewer pollutants, presents a viable alternative to conventional fuels.In his communication with the minister, Suyash Gupta, Director General of IAC, highlighted the dual environmental and economic benefits of Auto LPG. He stated, \"Its adoption can lead to substantial reductions in emissions like CO2 and particulate matter, thereby significantly improving air quality and public health.\"The IAC has outlined strategic proposals to boost the adoption of Auto LPG. These include a more pronounced role for Auto LPG in the national clean fuel policy alongside electric vehicles (EVs) and compressed natural gas (CNG), tax incentives for manufacturers to produce Auto LPG vehicle variants, and a reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on Auto LPG from 18% to 5%. Aligning the GST rate with that of domestic LPG is expected to curb illegal diversion and make Auto LPG more affordable for consumers.Gupta expressed confidence in the positive impact of these changes, saying, \"We are confident that with Minister Gadkari's visionary leadership, India can position itself at the forefront of the global transition towards sustainable and cleaner transportation solutions. His support will be instrumental in integrating Auto LPG into India&rsquo;s clean fuel strategy.\"The push by the IAC comes at a crucial time as India looks to diversify its energy sources and reduce its dependence on imported oil, aiming to meet its environmental and economic objectives efficiently.",

            "articleBody": "As the global community intensifies its efforts to combat climate change, India stands at the forefront of this battle, propelled by significant advancements in Technology, Trade, Talent, and Throughput (4T). These pillars not only accelerate India's journey towards its Net Zero goals but also pave the way for establishing full-scale circularity across the nation, particularly in the clean energy transition ecosystem.  In recent years, India has witnessed a remarkable surge in the adoption of renewable energy sources (RES), with the share of RES in the country's electricity generation mix increasing from 22 per cent to 30 per cent between 2019 and 2023, spearheaded by solar energy projects. This exponential growth trajectory is poised to continue, with renewable energy projects projected to reach an all-time high every year throughout this decade, as indicated by the Clean Energy Progress Tracker (CSEP).  However, the transition to clean energy is not merely about generating power from renewable sources; it entails a comprehensive materials transition, necessitating full-scale circularity across every sector of the economy. This is where India's 4T approach plays a pivotal role.  In India&rsquo;s pursuit of circularity, Throughput plays a crucial role in the energy transition and critical minerals sector, encompassing both scale and efficiency. It signifies not only the magnitude of production and consumption but also the speed at which materials are processed. Higher throughput on the supply side means more resources are available, driving down costs and fostering innovation. This, in turn, enhances accessibility to clean energy solutions, making them competitive against fossil fuels. India's initiatives in promoting circularity through policy reforms and partnerships are commendable, reflecting a global shift towards sustainability. Throughput isn't just about quantity; it's about accelerating progress towards a cleaner, more equitable future.  Talent development emerges as a crucial aspect of India's circularity journey, with a focus on creating a sustainable workforce equipped to meet the demands of green jobs. Efforts by Skill India to tap into the burgeoning green job sector reflect a proactive approach, with estimates suggesting the creation of 3.5 crore green jobs by 2047. Encouragingly, a significant portion of Indian youth exhibits keen interest in green jobs, signaling a promising trajectory for sustainable employment opportunities.  Despite 85 per cent youth interest, only 4 per cent are currently employed in this sector, a gap that needs bridging. Initiatives like the Skill Council for Green Jobs are crucial, integrating green education from schools to universities. Such efforts underscore India's commitment to nurturing a skilled workforce, essential for a thriving green economy.  Trade plays a pivotal role in India's clean energy transition, facilitating access to green technologies and raw materials essential for manufacturing. While some resources are abundant domestically, many are still sourced through imports. The transition towards full-scale circularity presents a viable solution, reducing reliance on imports and bolstering self-sufficiency. However, achieving this requires strategic trade practices, including building reserves and embracing localization. Upon reaching circularity, India could emerge as a global exporter of recycled materials.  Fortunately, India is already steering its policies and budget allocations towards sustainable development and clean energy adoption. However, to truly green its trade practices, additional measures are imperative. Integrating carbon pricing frameworks can incentivize low-carbon practices, and circular innovation, while ensuring supply chains remain traceable and transparent.  Technology serves as the driving force behind India's transition towards circularity in the energy sector. While significant strides have been made, there's no denying that we're still on the path to achieving full circularity in the energy sector. Made-in-India technology and PLI scheme is pivotal in this endeavor, particularly in areas such as battery technology and materials recycling for electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Reports suggest that circularity initiatives could lead to a substantial reduction in emissions from key sectors such as steel, aluminum, plastics, and cement by 56 per cent by 2050. Collaborative efforts between the government and private sector, as highlighted by the FICCI, are instrumental in developing frameworks and performance indicators to assess India's circular economy transition and track progress across value chains.  India's concerted efforts in enhancing renewable energy capacity, securing critical mineral supply chains, and investing in green technologies underscore its commitment to sustainable development. By leveraging talent, trade, throughput, and technology, India is laying a robust foundation to not only meet but potentially surpass its Net Zero targets, positioning itself as a global leader in the transition towards a circular economy.",

            "articleBody": "China's President Xi Jinping made a congratulatory call on Thursday to incoming European Council President Antonio Costa, Chinese state media said, a few hours before European Commission curbs on Chinese electric cars are scheduled to take effect. The Commission is set to confirm provisional import tariffs of up to 37.6% on Chinese-manufactured electric vehicles (EVs), after the bloc accused the world's No.2 economy of providing its firms with heavy state subsidies. Xi said he \"attaches great importance to the development of China-EU relations\" as Europe braces for retaliatory measures from Beijing and the possible opening up of a new front in the West's tariff war with the $18.6 trillion economy. EU trade policy has turned increasingly protective over concerns that China's production-focused development model could see it flooded with cheap goods as Chinese firms look to step up exports amid weak domestic demand. China and the European Commission have been in negotiations since last week over the curbs that Beijing and some European automakers want scrapped. Beijing rejects accusations that Chinese EVs are unfairly subsidised. Xi said China \"is committed to developing the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership,\" according to the report. \"China has always regarded Europe as an important pole in the multipolar order,\" he added. It will fall to Costa, a former Portuguese prime minister, to find common cause among the Council's 27 member states, as they waver over whether to back the Commission on the EV tariffs in an advisory vote in coming weeks. Germany, whose carmakers made a third of their sales last year in China, reportedly wants to stop the tariffs, while France has been among the firmest backers. China is currently undertaking an anti-dumping probe into European brandy imports. Almost all EU brandy exports to China came from France last year, Chinese customs data shows.  Beijing has also opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of European pork and its by-products, which analysts say is aimed at pressuring Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark to break with the Commission over the curbs.

The vehicles in question, with model years between 2012 and 2018, showed more than 10% higher carbon dioxide emissions in tests, on average, than what GM reported, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Additionally, GM agreed to write off greenhouse gas credits that equate to approximately 50 million tons of CO2, the EPA said, with a market value of hundreds of millions of dollars. GM shares fell 0.51% Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Last year, GM paid the NHTSA a similar penalty of USD 128 million when pick-up trucks sold several year prior failed to meet fuel economy standards. In March, the Biden administration issued more stringent automobile emission standards for vehicles produced in the United States. The updated standards would progressively restrict the amount of emissions allowed as a way to incentivize automakers to pivot to producing more electric vehicles.",

            "articleBody": " In an earlier statement, Ineos said it was \"delaying the launch... for two reasons; reluctant consumer uptake of EVs and industry uncertainty around tariffs, timings and taxation\".Ineos, the producer of petrochemicals and fledgling carmaker, said Wednesday that it was pausing the launch of its first electric vehicles, citing \"reluctant consumer uptake\" as a key reason. The decision by the group, owned by British billionaire and Manchester United stakeholder Jim Ratcliffe, comes less than five months after it announced plans to start producing Ineos Fusilier EV models in 2027.The 'green' project \"is paused but categorically not abandoned\", a spokesperson told AFP Wednesday.In an earlier statement, Ineos said it was \"delaying the launch... for two reasons; reluctant consumer uptake of EVs and industry uncertainty around tariffs, timings and taxation\".Ineos stressed it was \"committed to bringing an EV to market not just because of legislation but because we want to -- it is the right thing to do -- but as a new small volume manufacturer we can only produce vehicles that will sell.\" Recent data has showed a slowing of EV purchases in the UK and abroad, blamed on high prices amid a cost-of-living crisis.The Ineos Fusilier is a slightly smaller version of the Ineos Grenadier, which comes in petrol and diesel models.Ratcliffe recently announced plans for two versions of the Fusilier -- an all-electric model and the other a range-extender type which would carry a battery plus a small motor to produce electricity for the motor.Ineos on Wednesday noted that its \"low-emission solution for longer journeys or where charging is not possible would still be banned from sale in both Europe and the UK in 2035, if not earlier in the UK should Labour be elected\".Britain's centre-left Labour party is widely expected to win the country's general election on Thursday, which would end 14 years of rule by the right-wing Conservatives.That would see Prime Minister Rishi Sunak relinquish his role to Labour leader Keir Starmer.",

            "articleBody": "Guwahati: The Assam cabinet on Wednesday decided to refer a case, related to the closure of the 5 MW Bordikorai Hydro Electric Project due to environmental non-clearance, to the CBI, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. The power project was proposed to be set up in Biswanath district and a private firm was given the task in 2009 but in 2012, the forest department pointed out that no environmental clearance was taken for the project, the chief minister said at a media briefing after the cabinet meeting. The project was abruptly closed in 2015 on the ground that it was not viable and the Gauhati High Court directed the government to pay a compensation of Rs 100 crore to the firm, he pointed out. At that time, Tarun Gogoi headed a Congress government in the state. ''We have referred the case to the CBI to investigate the circumstances leading to the closure of the project abruptly when an environmental clearance could have been taken,'' Sarma said. He pointed out that the matter is not politically motivated and no politicians are involved in it. ''The then chief minister (Tarun Gogoi), who was also the power minister, had signed the order for the closure. He is no more. Some bureaucrats, however, have to give an explanation on its closure,'' he added. The cabinet also decided to extend the agreement between the state government and Tata Trusts to set up cancer care hospitals in Assam for another five years. The pact ended recently. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will be signed soon and the Tata Trusts which have already set up or are in the process of constructing 17 such hospitals will continue with the collaboration. The Assam government is spending Rs 2,803 crore and the Tata Trusts Rs 1,100 crore in the projects. The state government will also set up 50-bed ICUs in 22 districts of the state at the cost of Rs 23 crore in each district through Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode, Sarma said. The council of ministers also decided to waive the examination fees for Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe students for all recruitment tests in the state, the chief minister added.",

CII Karnataka will be taking forward the initiatives for the year 2024-25 aligned to the theme \"Globally Competitive Karnataka - Partnerships for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth,\" its Chairman N Venu said at a press conference here. The focus will be on policy advocacy, thought leadership, inclusiveness, ecosystem competitiveness, growth, sustainability, global linkages, and international partnerships, he said.Collaborating closely with the government, CII Karnataka aims to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, Venu said, adding, key areas include technology and innovation, clean and alternative energy, MSME (Micro, Small, &amp; Medium Enterprises) growth, and emerging sectors such as semiconductors, solar and mobile phones (electronic).According to him, CII will continue to work closely with the policy makers on ease of doing business and sectoral policies with a focus on promoting clean energy and alternative fuels, strengthening competitiveness of MSMEs, building stronger industry-academia and industry-startup connects to drive industrial growth both in and beyond Bengaluru. \"We are committed to embracing advanced technologies and fostering innovation, which will be fundamental to our efforts of supporting industry 4.0 transformation. Our goal is to strengthen Karnataka's position as the hub for cutting-edge research, development, and implementation. By collaborating with stakeholders and leveraging technology, we believe we can make remarkable progress,\" he said. Vice Chairman of CII Karnataka, Rabindra Srikantan, said CII Karnataka's commitment to growth aligns with the aspirations of the state. \"MSMEs play a vital role in Karnataka's economic landscape. It is crucial to support industry through services that drive competitiveness, sustainability and transformation, build business connects and linkages to growth through partnerships,\" Srikantan said.According to CII Karnataka, emerging sectors such as aerospace, electric mobility, healthcare, and agri-tech hold immense potential for growth and job creation. Karnataka makes a significant contribution to the country's GDP; however, the majority of the growth in Karnataka comes from Bengaluru. The 'Beyond Bengaluru' initiative intends to empower tier 2 and 3 cities across Karnataka to allow them to meaningfully contribute to the economic growth in the state, it was noted. Venu said CII would also proactively engage with various stakeholders, including international consulates, to seek out business opportunities, promote job preparedness through focused programmes and cross learning initiatives for both faculty and students, and strengthen entrepreneurship and leadership development through targeted initiatives such as the 'CII Indian Women Network' and 'CII Young Indians.'",

            "articleBody": "Paris: The chief executive officer of the world's main verifier for corporate climate targets is stepping down after facing staff demands that he quit over the organisation's backflip on carbon credits.Luiz Amaral said late Tuesday he would depart as CEO of the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) at the end of the month for \"personal reasons\".It follows a staff revolt in April after SBTi announced it would consider allowing the companies it vets to use carbon credits to offset pollution across their supply chain.Carbon credits are generated by projects that reduce or avoid emissions like renewable energy or tree planting, but critics say they allow the companies that buy them to keep polluting without cleaning up their act.SBTi's decision represented a reversal of its long-held stance on the limited use of such offsets, and sparked immediate calls for Amaral and the group's board to resign.Amaral's statement made no reference to the furore, but cited personal reasons that \"require my full attention at this time, prompting my decision to step down\".The group's chief legal officer, Susan Jenny Ehr, would act as CEO on an interim basis.SBTi, which is partnered with the UN and WWF, and receives funding from the Bezos Earth Fund and IKEA Foundation, is the gold standard benchmark for assessing the net zero plans of big businesses. Verification by SBTi allows companies to say their climate plans align with science and the goals of the Paris agreement to limit global warming.- 'License to pollute' -Amaral said the organisation had verified the climate targets of more than 5,500 companies and financial institutions and thousands of others were seeking validation.The organisation had previously held a narrow view on carbon credits, requiring companies take action first to reduce their greenhouse gas output, and only turn to offsets for the remaining, hardest-to-cut emissions.Then in April it flagged relaxing these rules in regards to offsetting Scope 3 emissions, which occur in the value chain, and represent the lion's share of the carbon footprints of most companies.In an open letter, staff criticised the way the decision was taken, accusing the board of ignoring the organisation's internal expert and scientific advice about the use of carbon credits.A single credit is supposed to represent one tonne of CO2 removed from the atmosphere or prevented from entering it, but revelations some do little or nothing for the environment have damaged their credibility.Just hours before Amaral's resignation, more than 80 civil society groups including Greenpeace and Amnesty International publicly called for SBTi to rule out the use of carbon credits.\"Offsetting often ends up providing the social license for high-emitting activities to continue\" and allowing companies to use them would \"likely slow down\" global efforts to address climate change, they warned.",

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: China's President Xi Jinping said he supports Kazakhstan joining the BRICS bloc, Chinese state media reported on Wednesday, as the group of developing nations mulls further expansion to rival a Western-dominated world order it sees as outdated. Speaking to the press alongside Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev following a meeting in the Central Asian state's capital, Xi encouraged Kazakhstan to \"play the role of a middle power on the international stage and make its due contribution to global governance\", while endorsing Astana's accession. China and Russia are pushing for the expansion of the BRICS grouping, which also includes Brazil, India and South Africa, as they seek to counter Western economic dominance. Originally an acronym coined by Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill in 2001, the bloc was founded as an informal four-nation club in 2009 and added South Africa a year later. Last August, the BRICS bloc agreed to admit Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates. However, Saudi Arabia has not yet joined the group.  Argentina had planned to join BRICS, but President Javier Milei withdrew his country soon after taking office in December. Xi is in Kazakhstan to attend a heads of state meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization from July 3-4. During his meeting with Tokayev, China and Kazakhstan also agreed to double their two-way trade as soon as possible and deepen cooperation in oil and gas exploration, extraction and processing, the report added. Crude oil and petroleum gases made up the bulk of Kazakhstan's exports to China last year, according to United Nations COMTRADE data, with outbound shipments to the world's No.2 economy worth $3.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. As such, Xi and Tokayev agreed to take measures to ensure the long-term, safe and stable operation of the crude oil pipeline running between their respective countries and the Kazakhstan section of the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline running from China's Xinjiang region to Turkmenistan, the report said. The two leaders also pledged to strengthen cooperation in clean energy, including wind, solar and nuclear power, with Chinese companies stepping in to help upgrade Kazakhstan's energy grid and power stations. Chinese firms have invested $9.5 billion in Kazakhstan since Xi first proposed his flagship Belt and Road Initiative during a state visit in 2013, data from the American Enterprise Institute think tank shows, almost all of which has been in the state's petroleum or nuclear energy industries.",

            "articleBody": "The newest technology in the fight against climate change has suffered its biggest loss. Last month, carbon removal startup Running Tide announced it was shutting down after failing to secure further funding. It won&rsquo;t be the last.Founded in 2017, Running Tide aimed to grow macroalgae to capture carbon dioxide, then sink it deep in the ocean where it wouldn&rsquo;t release that carbon for centuries. Scientific studies raised questions about whether such techniques could work at large scale. Last year, Running Tide claimed it delivered hundreds of tons of removal to Shopify, though it did so by sinking wood instead of seaweed.Tackling climate change requires reducing planet-warming emissions first. But the lack of sufficient action means the world will have to draw down CO2 in the atmosphere. The urgency of doing so, combined with some clever ways to finance climate technologies, has now created more than 800 carbon removal startups. Most of them are likely to meet Running Tide&rsquo;s fate.&ldquo;We expect more of this to happen in the coming months and years,&rdquo; said Nan Ransohoff, head of climate at the payments company Stripe Inc. and lead of Frontier, a fund that aims to accelerate the development of carbon removal technologies. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a sign of what an early ecosystem looks like.&rdquo;The automobile industry is a good example of what healthy development can look like. The US had hundreds of small automakers in the early 20th century, but only three big ones remain. Similarly, China had more than 500 companies registered as makers of electric vehicles as recently as 2019. Today, there are only a few dozen.But there&rsquo;s a big difference. People want cars, but they don&rsquo;t clamor in the same way for carbon removal. That&rsquo;s partly because of the cost. Reducing emissions is cheaper than removing CO2 from the air. Within the carbon removal industry, there are a range of prices for different techniques, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell which ones work as promised &mdash; and if the added cost of more verifiable methods is worth it. &ldquo;There are fundamental questions about carbon removal that society needs to answer,&rdquo; said Eric Toone, chief technology officer of Breakthrough Energy. &ldquo;Does society want to pay $500 a ton to be absolutely certain I captured carbon and know exactly where it is? Or does it want to pay 10 cents a ton and hope for the best?&rdquo; The vast majority of carbon for sale today is on the lower end of the scale and buyers are primarily paying to avoid emissions through reducing deforestation or deploying clean energy rather than removing CO2. Bloomberg Green investigations have found a number of fraudulent projects. These tons of carbon are largely bought and sold on the voluntary market, where the ramifications of getting the accounting wrong aren&rsquo;t very high. That incentivizes companies to seek out the cheapest price per ton possible, not the most permanent or verifiable removals, which are often the most costly. &ldquo;The problem is the voluntary carbon market is voluntary,&rdquo; Marty Odlin, founder of Running Tide, wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing it was shuttering. &ldquo;There simply isn&rsquo;t the demand needed to support large scale carbon removal.&rdquo;That lack of demand is why there were hardly any startups in the space a few years ago. In 2019, that started to change when Stripe decided to drive the creation of a high-quality carbon removal market. At first, it meant spending millions of dollars of its own money buying carbon removal credits from companies at whatever cost they would sell. Stripe did so knowing some companies wouldn&rsquo;t be able to deliver. Ransohoff said Running Tide got one such deal from Stripe worth $500,000 (of which $150,000 was for 600 tons of removal and the rest for research).Once that spurred the creation of some startups, Stripe led the creation of Frontier. The platform secured more than $900 million from companies like Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. to make advanced-purchase commitments that only pay startups once they deliver verifiable carbon removal tons. (Frontier also has a pre-purchase track for smaller orders from younger companies.)&ldquo;The world needs about 5 billion tons of carbon removal per year by 2050 as part of its net-zero strategy,&rdquo; said Ransohoff. &ldquo;If you then pull that back, the world needs between 50 and 100 million tons each year by 2030. That is a $20 billion market at $200 per ton.&rdquo;But now that there are hundreds of startups, Ransohoff said the market is likely to face a new problem: too much supply and not enough buyers. Some founders and investors argue that this overabundance is not a glitch in the system, but the way the industry was built by design: Throw everything against the wall and see what sticks. But Stripe is also working to grow demand. It has created a new fellowship program that will fund people committed to finding new buyers. And some governments are also stepping in to buy removal services, which is the kind of policy that helped cut the price of solar panels and lithium-ion batteries.Toone thinks there&rsquo;s always room for startups that can offer cheaper technologies. He believes that, if the cost of removal can be brought down to $100 a ton, then there&rsquo;s a market for using it as feedstock to make products, such as synthetic gasoline. &ldquo;One-hundred dollars a ton is the equivalent of 85 cents a gallon to the cost of gasoline,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I would be very interested in that.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s likely to mean more Running Tide-type failures for startups that can&rsquo;t lower removal costs.",

            "articleBody": "A year and a half after Hindenburg Research accused Gautam Adani of \"pulling the largest con in corporate history,\" the Indian market regulator is yet to conclude if the tycoon, said to be close to Narendra Modi, violated any securities laws. The inquiry has now shot itself in the foot by turning its gaze toward Asia&rsquo;s richest banker. Ordered by the Supreme Court to probe the allegations of price manipulation and accounting fraud against Adani &mdash; which he has strenuously denied &mdash; the Securities and Exchange Board, or SEBI, has stumbled upon a connection between last year&rsquo;s $150 billion meltdown in the conglomerate&rsquo;s stocks and billionaire Mumbai financier Uday Kotak. Even the disclosure of this link is courtesy of Hindenburg. The short seller has made public the show-cause notice it received last week from the SEBI. In the process of knocking down the letter, which it described as an attempt to &ldquo;silence and intimidate those who expose corruption and fraud perpetrated by the most powerful individuals in India,&rdquo; it revealed that the vehicle used to bet against Adani&rsquo;s flagship firm belonged to Kotak Mahindra (International) Ltd., a Mauritius-based subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.But the fund in question is only managed by the Kotak firm. The principal is New York-based hedge fund manager Mark Kingdon&rsquo;s Kingdon Capital Management. SEBI&rsquo;s notice includes extracts of time-stamped chats, where an employee of the American firm appears to be instructing a Kotak trader to sell futures contracts in Adani Enterprises Ltd. This went on for about two weeks, the SEBI says, ahead of the publication of the Hindenburg report on Jan. 24, 2023. The Kingdon-controlled fund squared off its short positions the following month for a profit of $22 million, shared between Kingdon and Hindenburg, which provided the research. Kotak was nothing more than a middleman, executing the trades.As Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a statement after its shares fell 2% Tuesday, &ldquo;Kingdon never disclosed that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price sensitive information.&rdquo; Hindenburg says it expects SEBI may try to impose bans or fines on the research firm. Kingdon told the SEBI he obtained legal advice about putting trades based on Hindenburg&rsquo;s draft report before it was made public, and that he isn&rsquo;t obliged to share the contents of the privileged communication.Ultimately, the only entity over which the Indian regulator has any jurisdiction here is the fund, a SEBI-registered foreign portfolio investor. That&rsquo;s perhaps the only reason to drag Kotak&rsquo;s Mauritius subsidiary into the inquiry &mdash; to stay in business, it has to cooperate. But by revealing the Indian institution&rsquo;s involvement, Hindenburg is challenging the regulator to go further and expand its scrutiny to the prominent Mumbai financier as well.That&rsquo;s a little odd. If the Indian banker was really acting in cahoots with the US short sellers, why would the research firm be throwing him under the bus? Hindenburg&rsquo;s larger point here is about fairness. After all, the SEBI has sent its show-cause notice to both Mark Kingdon and Nathan Anderson, the Hindenburg founder, accusing them of violating its regulations along with their firms. It has sent a similar notice to Kotak&rsquo;s Mauritius subsidiary, too, because it is the manager of the fund used for short-selling. Yet, the regulator has decided to keep Kotak, the banker, out of its investigation. &ldquo;We suspect SEBI&rsquo;s lack of mention of Kotak or any other Kotak board member may be meant to protect yet another powerful businessman from the prospect of scrutiny, a role SEBI seems to embrace,&rdquo; Hindenburg said in its response to the notice. The securities watchdog has invited this embarrassment upon itself. A year ago, the SEBI was telling a court-appointed panel that it was investigating the 13 opaque offshore entities that held, as of March 2020, between 14% and 20% across five publicly traded stocks of the Adani Group. It wanted to verify whether the 42 investors who put capital into these 13 vehicles &mdash; 12 funds and one overseas financial firm &mdash; were mere fronts for Adani and his family, masquerading as public shareholders. The conglomerate has denied these allegations.A year later, however, the focus seems to have changed. While it did send a couple of show-cause notices to the Adani flagship during the March quarter, there&rsquo;s still no sign of the final report it was supposed to submit to the Supreme Court by April after concluding its investigation into the $207 billion Adani empire. Instead, the regulator is taking on the short sellers, a clear indication that proving or rejecting their allegations against the Indian infrastructure czar is no longer the priority. And for that, Adani should consider sending a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; note to Anderson, the Hindenburg founder.The Indian group&rsquo;s market capitalisation plunged by $45 billion in just one day after the election result fell short of an outright majority for Modi&rsquo;s party. The conglomerate regained its footing as the prime minister began his third five-year term with the help of coalition partners, though its valuation is still $28 billion lower than before the short-seller report last year. Now that the SEBI inquiry has gone in the wrong direction, and Hindenburg has dared the watchdog by bringing up Kotak&rsquo;s name, Adani can go in search of new infrastructure deals &mdash; from transport and energy to data centers and building materials. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he won&rsquo;t be asking Kotak Mahindra to pony up money.The views expressed here are the author's own, and not EconomicTimes.com's",

            "articleBody": "Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) have been separately considering bids for Santos, Bloomberg News reported, sending shares of the Australian gas producer up 6.5% on Thursday. Both Saudi Aramco and ADNOC have been conducting preliminary evaluations of Santos as a possible acquisition target, the report said, citing sources who declined to be named as the information was private. The sources said Santos could attract interest from other potential buyers, according to the report. Deliberations are on, and the suitors have not decided whether to proceed with any proposals, it added. \"Santos does not comment on media speculation,\" a company spokesperson said. Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, while ADNOC declined to comment. Santos shares rose to a high of A$8.18 and last traded up 5% at A$8.09, outpacing a 1% rise in the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 . Adelaide-based Santos had a market capitalisation of $16.63 billion as of Wednesday's close, up 1% since the start of the year. Santos, with assets stretching across Australia to Alaska and Papua New Guinea (PNG), has been eyed by suitors over the past several years for its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business, especially its stake in PNG LNG. The company produced 91.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) last year and had proven plus probable reserves of 1,661 mmboe as of the end of last year. Its biggest development project is the Barossa gas project in waters off northwestern Australia, which has faced delays and cost increases following court fights with an Indigenous group over the planned route for a gas pipeline from the field.  DOUBTS ON A DEAL A Santos shareholder and an analyst both played down the likelihood of an offer from Aramco or ADNOC. \"I think Santos is an attractively priced company with a handful of great assets, but despite this, I find it hard to imagine a would-be buyer flagging its interest prior to making an offer,\" said Simon Mawhinney, managing director of fund manager Allan Gray. \"So I'm inclined not to put too much, if any, weight on these reports and happily be proven wrong on this point.\" MST Financial senior analyst Saul Kavonic said Aramco and ADNOC have been looking at a number of LNG opportunities but Santos would be \"a big step out of their comfort zone\", politically, operationally and by size. Australia's Woodside Energy held preliminary talks with Santos earlier this year to form a $52 billion energy giant, however discussions collapsed, and Santos said it would continue to review options to unlock value for its shareholders. \"Santos has been shopping itself for a while, so there could be quite a few players out there who have pursued preliminary assessments,\" Kavonic said, adding that Santos' domestic assets might be an obstacle to any buyout. \"We remain of the view that a bid for Santos at a material premium is unlikely to emerge, despite Santos shopping itself for some time,\" he said.

            "articleBody": "Astana: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were set to participate Thursday in a regional summit in Central Asia bringing together numerous countries opposed to the West.Putin and Xi regularly meet under the aegis of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) alliance, whose latest session is being held in Kazakhstan's capital city of Astana. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also attending, since his country is a \"dialogue partner\" with the bloc, whose full members including ex-Soviet Central Asian states, India, China, Russia and Iran.On Wednesday, Putin had bilateral meetings with Erdogan and Xi ahead of the main session, telling the Chinese leader that the Shanghai alliance was strengthening its role as \"one of the key pillars of a fair multipolar world order\".Both countries have railed against what they call US-led \"hegemony\" on the world stage.Xi, criticised in the West for his growing support for Moscow, told Putin Wednesday he was delighted to see his \"old friend\" again.Erdogan also met Putin on the sidelines Wednesday, inviting him to Turkey and calling for a \"fair peace that can satisfy both sides\" in Ukraine. The Turkish leader has sought to mediate between the warring countries.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not attending.- Competition with West -The SCO was founded in 2001 but has come to prominence in recent years. Its nine full member countries are China, India, Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.It is intended to be a platform for cooperation in competition with the West, with a focus on security and economics.A year after Western-sanctioned Iran joined as a full member, Belarus, also ostracised for its backing for Russia's war in Ukraine, will become the 10th full member Thursday.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in an interview with Kazakh media praised the alliance for \"demonstrating to the world that there are alternative international platforms, different centres of power\".The alliance claims to represent 40 percent of the global population and about 30 percent of its GDP but it is a disparate group with many internal disagreements including territorial disputes.While Russia and China are united against Western domination, they are economic competitors in Central Asia, a region rich in oil and gas that is also a crucial transport route between Asia and Europe.- Alternative routes -The summit includes Gulf states among its \"dialogue partners\" and in a sign of its growing importance, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is set to address delegates Thursday.With the event's security focus, Afghanistan is a likely topic. It has observer status in the SCO but has been absent since the Taliban took power in 2021.None of the members have formally recognised the Taliban government but China has named an ambassador to Kabul, Kazakhstan has removed the Taliban from its list of banned organisations and Moscow has said it will do the same.But the SCO's main thrust is economic ties between member countries and developing giant projects to link up China and Europe via Central Asia. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased major powers' interest in the region, where Moscow is seeking to maintain its traditional sway but where China now has strong ties through its flagship Belt and Road infrastructure project, while the West is also vying for influence.Western sanctions against Russia have blocked much-used transport links between China and Europe and prompted the European Union to seek alternative routes including through Central Asia.",

            "articleBody": "Some of the world&rsquo;s biggest oil-hauling supertankers are instead loading up vast volumes of diesel in the latest sign of how attacks by Yemen&rsquo;s Houthis are upending global shipping. At least one so-called very large crude carrier, or VLCC, capable of hauling two million barrels of oil is already sailing from the Middle East to Europe, while another is in the process of loading, according to Kpler and ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. At least five more are expected to switch to carrying so-called clean petroleum product, a category that includes diesel, shipbroker Braemar Plc said. That would mean about 14 million barrels of the fuel could end up on the huge ships.The switchover has been at least partly a knock-on effect of Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that have upended some longstanding trade routes.The incidents boosted earnings for smaller vessels that haul fuels like gasoline and diesel &mdash; known in industry jargon as clean tankers &mdash; as the ships sail thousands of miles extra around Africa. At the same time, benchmark crude tanker rates have been easing, giving shipowners an incentive to switch their vessels out of that trade.While it&rsquo;s unclear precisely how much diesel-type fuel will end up on VLCCs and what its final destination will be, at least some appears to be heading to Europe from the Middle East.&ldquo;Larger clean tankers have faced increased volatility and notably higher rates this year,&rdquo; in part as ships sail further around Africa, according to Svetlana Lobaciova, principal analyst at EA Gibson Shipbrokers. &ldquo;In contrast, Suezmaxes and more recently VLCCs have relatively underperformed, with relatively lower spot earnings on benchmark trades at times being substantial enough to encourage larger crude tankers to clean up and compete in the clean tanker market.&rdquo;Houthis ImpactThe shift in sailing distances as a result of Houthi attacks can be seen in a measure of shipping demand called ton-miles, which multiplies cargo by how far it is transported. This gives a sense of how heavily used the global shipping fleet is. A year ago, for refined fuels being shipped from the Middle East, that measure was forecast to increase by 13 per cent in 2024, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world&rsquo;s biggest shipbroker. It is now estimated that it will rise by 17 per cent this year.Likewise, imports of fuels to northwest Europe were previously expected to rise 16 per cent this year, and those to the Mediterranean by 7 per cent. Those estimates now stand at 22 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, underscoring the increased strain on the global fleet and explaining why traders are turning to bigger ships.Large volumes of fuel arriving in one go create a sudden influx of supply, a potentially volatile influence on benchmark diesel prices. The norm is for a broadly smoother flow of smaller ships discharging.Part of the forward curve for ICE Gasoil futures &mdash; Europe&rsquo;s diesel benchmark &mdash; traded in a structure signaling oversupply for the first time in almost three weeks on Wednesday.In addition to the supertankers, crude carriers that haul one million barrels known as Suezmaxes have also been switching over. About 12 of them are likely to transition to carrying clean petroleum products in the near future, Braemar said. Gibson previously said that at least 10 of the vessels had already switched to transporting clean fuels this year.&ldquo;As CPP volumes are shipped further around the Cape of Good Hope, transport costs per barrel can be cut by leveraging economies of scale, employing fewer, larger vessels,&rdquo; Braemar analysts wrote in a report, referring to clean petroleum products.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: A visit to Russia by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expected within days, could help dispel worries that New Delhi is getting too close to the West and further away from Moscow, ceding space to China, analysts said. No dates have yet been set for the visit, although it has been confirmed by both sides. Indian media said Modi will be in Moscow next week, around the time of a NATO summit in Washington, at which Ukraine will be one of the main issues. While the West has tried to isolate Putin, China, India and powers in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America have continued to build ties, with official figures showing rising trade with Russia. \"It will be a good opportunity for Moscow to project in the media the image of President Putin receiving a leader of a country like India in the context of the Washington summit,\" said Aleksei Zakharov, a Moscow-based expert on India. \"India's objective is to ensure that Russia is not in China's corner and that, even if it does not explicitly support India, it maintains a permanent neutrality in the India-China territorial disputes.\" Ties between India and China have been frosty since a deadly border war in 2020. The leaders of Russia and India have held annual summits since 2000 but the last in-person meeting was in 2021, when Putin visited Delhi. The next meeting had been due in Moscow in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, but it did not happen, while Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping elevated their ties, pledging a \"new era\" of partnership in May. The two are meeting at a security summit on Wednesday in Kazakhstan, to which Modi has sent his foreign minister. India has also been seeking to distance itself from its largest arms supplier, Russia, as the Ukraine war hobbled the latter's ability to supply munitions and spares. The dearth of Modi's visits to Moscow had given \"rise to speculation that there was some kind of drift in the Indo-Russia relationship,\" said analyst Nandan Unnikrishnan, of the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi. \"So I think Modi's visit will put an end to that kind of speculation,\" he said. \"And we don't want to spoil our relationship with any party, whether it's Russia, the United States, or anyone because of another relationship.\" India's foreign ministry declined to comment. At a regular press conference last week, it said, \"We have a very well established bilateral summit arrangement with the Russian Federation ... and are also preparing to hold the next summit.\"  On Tuesday, the Kremlin said deepening trade and economic ties would be a key theme of Modi's visit which was in the \"final stage\" of preparation. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said regional security and global security issues always figured high on the agenda of such meetings. India, which has stepped up purchases of Russian oil shunned by the West, is expected to seek a discount higher than the current rate of $3 to $3.5 a barrel during the visit, sources said. It will also seek formal approval for a unit of Oil and Natural Gas Corp to retain its stake of 20% in the Sakhalin 1 oil project in Russia's far east. The unit, ONGC Videsh, and the oil ministries of India and Russia, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India has also been keen to boost exports of pharmaceutical, machinery and other goods to Russia. Two-way trade jumped 33% to $65.7 billion in the last fiscal year that ended in March, with India's imports accounting for $61.43 billion.",

            "articleBody": "Johannesburg: The UAE's International Resources Holding (IRH) has withdrawn a bid to buy a stake in Vedanta Resources Ltd's Zambian copper mines, it said on Wednesday, after talks collapsed because of a failure to agree on the assets' value. IRH, an arm of United Arab Emirate (UAE)'s International Holding Company, the emirate's richest company, had offered to buy a 51 per cent stake in Vedanta's Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) for more than $1 billion, Reuters reported in April. It had wanted the mines to consolidate its copper position in Zambia after buying a 51 per cent stake in Mopani Copper Mines in a deal concluded in March. But IRH told Reuters it was \"not currently pursuing the acquisition of a majority stake in the Zambian assets\". \"IRH terminated the transaction discussions two months ago due to discrepancies in valuation,\" it added in an emailed statement. The UAE and even bigger regional oil power Saudi Arabia are seeking to secure critical metal supplies from Africa, as they attempt to participate in the transition to green energy. Vedanta owns 80 per cent in KCM and the Zambian government holds the remaining shareholding through state firm ZCCM-IH. Chris Griffith, the CEO for Vedanta Base Metals, told Reuters in June IRH was among investors conducting due diligence on the Zambian assets. IRH offered about $1 billion for a 51 per cent stake in KCM, but Vedanta was only willing to sell a minority equity stake of about 30 per cent for almost double the amount IRH offered for a bigger shareholding, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The source declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the issue. Vedanta, owned by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, late last year regained control of KCM after a five-year battle to recover the copper mines and smelter that were seized by the administration of former Zambian president Edgar Lungu after it accused the company of failing to invest in expanding copper production. The miner has been trying to sell a stake in the Zambian copper mines to raise about $1.2 billion required to settle debts, revive the operations and invest in advancing the Konkola Deep Mining Project, which holds one of the richest copper deposits in the world. \"Vedanta remains committed to exploring all funding options - both debt and equity - which are aligned with what we believe is in the best interests of KCM,\" a spokesperson said via email. The spokesperson declined to comment on \"any ongoing discussions or negotiations\" with potential partners. (Reporting by Felix Njini; Editing by Veronica Brown and Barbara Lewis)",

The government in February 2023 found its first lithium deposits in Jammu and Kashmir with estimated reserves of 5.9 million metric tons. After it failed to get a required minimum of three bids in its first auctions in November, the block was again put up for auction in March with a May 14 deadline for bids. The source, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to talk to the media, said the block was likely to be given to a government agency for further exploration after no bids were made. India's Ministry of Mines did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. As electric vehicles have focused on the need for lithium, used in making batteries, India has sought to secure assets overseas as well as domestically. Analysts have however questioned the composition of the deposit in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian government in June last year, listed 30 minerals, including lithium, nickel, titanium, vanadium and tungsten as critical to its quest for cleaner energy. ",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India has asked power companies to order equipment worth $33 billion this year to fast track capacity additions of coal-fired power in the years ahead, as the South Asian nation struggles to meet booming electricity demand, two government officials said.  The unprecedented move by the government, which would result in record tendering in a year for the equipment by major power firms such as state-run NTPC and SJVN as well as by private companies Adani Power and Essar Power, will help add 31 gigawatts (GW) in the next 5-6 years, the sources said. Normally, the government leaves the tendering timing to the companies themselves. Expediting equipment orders for new coal-fired plants was discussed at a meeting held by Power Minister Manohar Lal, soon after the formation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal cabinet early last month, the sources said. The targets are ambitious given the country has ordered equipment for about 2-3 GW capacity annually in prior years, barring last year's orders for 10 GW.  India is rushing to add fresh coal-fired plants as it is barely able to meet high power demand with the existing fleet in non-solar hours. Post pandemic, the country's power demand scaled new records on the back of the fastest rate of economic growth among major economies and increased instances of heatwaves.  India saw its biggest power shortfall in 14 years in June, and had to race to avoid night time outages by deferring planned plant maintenance, and invoking an emergency clause to mandate companies to run plants based on imported coal and power. State-run Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), which bagged all power equipment contracts in auctions in the last year, is likely to get most of the contracts for the new equipment, the sources said. Larsen &amp; Toubro, the only other power equipment producer in the market, had not participated in most of last year's bids, they said. The Power Ministry, BHEL, Adani, NTPC, SJVN and L&amp;T did not immediately respond to emails sent by Reuters. The sources did not want to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media. \"The last large orders for power equipment were placed for about 20 GW around 2009-10 when Chinese companies bagged a major pie,\" one of the sources said. Policy flip-flops and lack of orders for coal-based plants over the past several years forced other equipment suppliers such as Thermax-Babcock, BGR-Hitachi and South Korea's Doosan to shut their manufacturing units in India.  The country, since 2020, discourages contracts with companies in countries sharing a land border such as China by mandating regulatory approvals. Since late last year, India has fast tracked coal-fired power plants to meet its power needs, threatening to undermine progress made by the world's No.3 greenhouse gas emitter in weaning its economy off carbon. In March Reuters reported private Indian firms have expressed interest in building at least 10 GW of coal-fired power capacity over a decade, ending a six-year drought in significant private involvement in the sector.

            "articleBody": "Singapore: India's solar power generation grew at the slowest pace in six years in the first half of 2024, an analysis of data from the federal grid regulator showed, as the country further stepped up reliance on coal to address surging power demand. Electricity generated from coal grew 10.4 per cent during six months ended June 30, a review of daily load despatch data from Grid-India showed, outpacing overall power generation growth of 9.7 per cent during the period.  Solar power generation in the third-largest producer of electricity from the sun rose to 63.6 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in the first half of 2024, the data showed, up 14.7 per cent compared with the same period last year and 18.5 per cent in the calendar year 2023. The world's fastest growing major economy has prioritised coal to address a surge in power demand in recent years, with coal-fired power output last year outpacing renewable energy output for the first time since the Paris accord in 2015. The south Asian nation's fuel use patterns since emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic have largely been in line with trends in the region, with Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Bangladesh all firing up coal for generating inexpensive power. The share of the fossil fuel in power output rose to 77.1 per cent in the first half of 2024, compared with 76.6 per cent in the same period last year, putting it on track to rise for the fourth straight year. India expects total electricity generation during the fiscal year ended March 2025 to grow at the fastest pace in over a decade, forecast to be mainly powered by an 8.9 per cent growth in coal-fired power output, outpacing renewable energy growth of 8.2 per cent. Analysts expect renewable generation to grow faster from the next fiscal year, as tendering and commissioning of green energy projects have started picking up steam. Moody's unit ICRA expects renewable energy installations to rise by over a third to 25 gigawatts (GW) this fiscal year ending March 2025.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Global hydroelectric generation slumped to a five-year low last year as a result of lower-than-average rainfall across China, North America and India, contributing to record fossil fuel combustion and emissions in 2023. Global hydro generation amounted to 4,240 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2023 down from a record 4,359 billion kWh in 2020, according to the Statistical Review of World Energy published by the UK Energy Institute. The slump over the last three years has been the largest on record, forcing the world's biggest producers to revert to coal and gas-fired power plants to replace lost generation, amplifying the upward trend in fossil fuel burning. But hydro is set to rebound this year thanks to higher rainfall and snow melt in key areas, which will combine with rapid deployment of wind and solar power to curb growth in fossil fuel use in 2024.  Chartbook: Global hydroelectric generation  Global hydro generation is highly concentrated, with two-thirds occurring in just seven countries - China (30%), Brazil (9%), Canada (9%), the United States (6%), Russia (5%), India (4%) and Norway (3%). China's generation fell by a massive 96 billion kWh in 2023 compared with three years earlier, accounting for 80% of the generation lost worldwide, according to the Statistical Review. Prolonged drought across south and central China cut water volumes down the Yangtze and other river systems, slashing power output even though the country brought new hydro dams and turbines into service. But there were also sharp downturns compared with three years earlier in the United States (-46 billion kWh), Canada (-22 billion kWh), India (-15 billion kWh) and Russia (-15 billion kWh). In the United States, hydro output fell to the lowest for 22 years, mostly as a result of an extended drought across the western part of the country, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  HYDRO REBOUND The outlook for hydro generators is looking more promising this year, with heavier rain and snowfall in most key producing areas, likely to drive a record one-year increase in output. China's generation had already climbed by 57 billion kWh (16%) in the first five months of 2024 compared with 2023, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Since then, southern and central regions have been inundated with heavier than normal monsoon rains, triggering multiple flood alerts on the Yangtze and other river systems. With most of the main flood season still ahead in July and August, China's generation is on course to set new records as heavy river flows enable the country to make full use of newly installed turbines. By May 2024, China had installed 423 million kilowatts (kW) of generating capacity, up from 370 million kW when generation last peaked in 2020, so there is potential to increase output significant if river volumes are high enough. In Brazil, hydro has already set a new record of 206 billion kWh in the first five months of the year, surpassing the previous high of 199 billion kWh. Reservoirs connected to the main Southeast and Midwest electricity transmission system, which account for most of the country's hydro potential, were storing enough water to generate 101 billion kWh at the end of June. Storage was down from 129 billion kWh at this point last year but was otherwise the highest since 2012, according to data from the country's transmission operator. U.S. hydro generation has also started to recover from last year's low, with the government forecasting it will be 6% higher in 2024. In China the main substitute for hydro is coal, while in Brazil and the United States it is gas, so the rebound in hydro is likely to trim fossil fuel combustion and emissions. If the hydro rebound is sufficiently large, and accompanied by continued rapid deployment of wind and solar farms, both of which seem likely, it could be enough to create a peak in coal burning and fossil fuel emissions, at least temporarily.By John Kemp",

Ramanujan Intellion Park has achieved a complete reduction of emissions through renewables or carbon off-sets, saving more than 20 per cent on water and embodied energy in materials while attaining over 42 per cent energy savings on-site.  Located strategically along Old Mahabalipuram Road (IT Expressway) in Taramani, Chennai, the 25.27-acre Ramanujan Intellion Park encompasses both a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) processing area and a non-processing zone.  Sanjay Dutt, MD &amp; CEO of Tata Realty, said, \"The financing from IFC is a strategic investment in advancing our efforts to enhance the sustainability and climate resilience of Ramanujan Intellion Park.\"  Dutt said this funding would enable the company to continue its leadership in green building practices.  Elaborating more on the project, Tata Realty said this fully owned and operational IT park hosts between 40,000 to 60,000 professionals across its six buildings daily.  The IT park includes the Taj Wellington Mews Hotel facility, which offers 112 serviced apartments and a 1,500-seater convention centre in the non-processing zone.  This financing initiative is a part of Tata Realty's broader commitment to advance its sustainability efforts and elevate the standard of green commercial spaces across India, the statement said.  The funds will further integrate state-of-the-art sustainable technologies and practices at this flagship asset, which boasts a total leasable area of about 4.67 million sq ft of IT/ITES commercial office spaces.  Imad N Fakhoury, IFC's Regional Director for South Asia, said, \"Business parks are key to greening the real estate sector, and Tata Realty's Ramanujan Intellion Park is at the forefront of this transformation.\"  Tata Realty and Infrastructure Ltd is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Tata Sons and one of the leading real estate development companies in India with an extensive portfolio of over 50 projects across 15 cities.  Tata Realty and Infrastructure Ltd has developed around 17.6 million square feet of commercial projects and has around 16.7 million square feet of projects under development &amp; planning.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Britain's renewables industry has called on the new Labour government to increase the country's renewable auction budget by hundreds of millions of pounds to help meet its offshore wind target and wider goal to decarbonise the power grid. Labour swept to victory in Britain's election last week and the party has pledged to expand the country's offshore wind capacity to 55 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, from around 15 GW now as part of wider climate goals. \"The only way for the new government to stay on track to meet their targets is to amend the (auction) budget upwards,\" said Tom Glover, UK Country Chair at RWE which plans to build new British offshore wind projects. To spur investment, renewable project developers can bid for government-backed price guarantees for the electricity produced, called Contracts for Difference (CfDs), with the budget for this year's sixth CfD auction set at 1 billion pounds ($1.28 billion), with 800 million pounds of this earmarked for offshore wind. \"To increase investment in shovel-ready offshore wind projects this year, unlocking capital investment and lowering average household bills, the government should raise this (offshore wind pot) to 1.5 billion pounds\" Nick Hibberd, markets and economics policy analyst at industry group Renewable UK said. The fifth auction, held in 2023 failed to tract any offshore wind projects as the incentives offered were deemed too low by developers, setting back progress towards meeting the former Conservative government's 50 GW by 2030 target. \"(This year's auction) is the last chance to be sure which projects will get CfDs for the projects to be delivered by 2030 so we really need to maximize the potential of this auction,\" said Damien Zachlod, managing director at EnBW generation UK, which has joint ventures with BP to build British offshore wind projects. Ashutosh Padelkar, associate for GB Power &amp; Renewables at consultancy Aurora, said the portion of auction funds dedicated to offshore wind would likely need to at least double to 1.65-1.95 billion pounds to support the 10 gigawatts of wind projects eligible to bid in the current round. \"This would need to be followed through with similar ambition in the next (seventh) allocation round to ensure industry confidence,\" he said. Britain's department for Energy Security and Net Zero did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",

            "articleBody": "WILMINGTON: Tesla shareholders will appear in court on Monday to argue that an unprecedented request for more than $7 billion in attorneys' fees to be paid by the company is \"outlandish,\" the latest twist in a legal showdown over Musk's $56 billion pay package. The record fee request was made by investor Richard Tornetta on behalf of three law firms that represented him, including Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann. Tornetta owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over Musk's pay package of stock options in 2018, a legal battle he ultimately won in January when the package was voided. The fee equals around $7.2 billion at Tesla's Friday's stock price and amounts to a rate of roughly $370,000 for every hour worked by the 37 lawyers, associates and paralegals, some of whom normally bill as little as $275 an hour, according to court documents submitted Tornetta's lawyers.  \"The legal fees appear exceedingly disproportionate and outlandish,\" Nathan Chiu, a Tesla shareholder from New Jersey, wrote to Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in March, according to a court filing.  Chiu, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and more than 8,000 Tesla stockholders have flooded the Delaware Chancery Court with some 1,500 letters and objections over the fee, according to court documents.  A hearing scheduled for Monday was moved from McCormick's usual courtroom to the largest in the building to accommodate the 47 attorneys from 19 law firms appearing in the case, as well potential stockholders. Tornetta's lawyers argue they deserve the fee as a cut of the benefit they say they conveyed to Tesla when a judge voided Musk's pay package, which returned to Tesla around 266 million shares reserved for the stock options. That stock would be worth about $67 billion at Friday's price of $251.82 per share. Tornetta's attorneys said it is the largest judgment ever awarded by an American court, excluding punitive damages. They argued they should receive a fee equal to 11% of that judgment, a percentage that is arguably conservative by Delaware legal precedent. They asked to be paid in the form of 29 million Tesla shares. RECORD FEE REQUEST While federal courts tend to lower the fee as a percentage of judgments or settlements as they get bigger, Delaware courts have gone the opposite way, awarding a larger percentage as an incentive for attorneys to push for a bigger recovery.  Tornetta's legal team said they would have been justified asking for up to 33% of the value of Musk's pay package. The fee request vastly outstrips the current record fee in shareholder litigation of $688 million in an Enron class action, according to Stanford Law School.  The Musk case took a dramatic turn when Tesla shareholders in June voted to ratify Musk's pay, which Tesla has argued corrected the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick identified in her ruling.  The company argues that Musk's pay package has been restored and that Tornetta's legal victory has been transformed into a loss. As a result, the case conveyed no benefit to Tesla and the shareholder lawyers should receive as little as $13.6 million, Tesla said.  Some of the shareholders who have opposed the request wrote form letters to the judge, but a few have hired attorneys to file formal objections to the fee, including Amy Steffens, a pilot, and Kurt Panouses, an attorney who specializes in representing lottery winners. McCormick may take weeks or months to rule. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently considering a $267 million fee request in a shareholder class action involving Dell Technologies and that decision could provide fee guidance.

He said that through the regeneration of energy by three-phase locomotives, the Kolkata-headquartered ER saved 1,09,84,814 units of energy, amounting to savings of approximately Rs 8.06 crore in the first quarter of the current financial year. Comprehensive measures to reduce use of traction and non-traction energy led to reducing its carbon footprint and saving electrical energy worth over Rs 12 crore in the first quarter of 2024-25 fiscal, ER spokesperson Kausik Mitra said. \"In June 2024 alone, regeneration in 51 three-phase locos resulted in savings of 25,83,640 units of energy, which translates to approximately Rs 1.94 crore in savings in energy bill for the month,\" he said. He said that measures taken by the zonal railway have led to reduction in consumption of fossil fuel leading to sustainable development. \"These efforts contribute to substantial cost savings and also align with the broader goal of reducing fossil fuel dependency,\" he said. Mitra said that additionally, ER saved over Rs 77 lakh on account of improved power factor and other rebates for non-traction energy bills from April to May this fiscal. He said that forced shutdowns of 874 diesel locomotives when not in use, led to significant savings of high-speed diesel worth Rs 3.32 crore.",

            "articleBody": "Mercedes-Benz India is looking at electric entry-level models to attract first-time luxury car buyers, as it sets eyes on another double-digit growth this year, its Managing Director and CEO Santosh Iyer said on Monday. The company, which launched all-electric entry SUV EQA 250 at an introductory price of Rs 66 lakh, has also introduced the new EQB 350 SUV (5-seater) priced at Rs 77.5 lakh and EQB 250+ SUV (7-seater) tagged at Rs 70.90 lakh (prices all India ex-showroom). It will also launch the EQS Maybach SUV and electrified G-Class models in India later this year. \"Because of the compelling total cost of ownership (TCO) argument, we are also looking at a lot of first-time buyers in the luxury segment to consider the EQA and the EQB as a better option to shift to luxury,\" Iyer told PTI. The new EVs from Mercedes-Benz -- EQA and EQB -- can solve the issues of young customers with household income of Rs 1- crore plus, who want to shift to luxury but always found TCO to be higher when it comes to combustion engine counterparts, he added. Now, with a lower TCO compared to a combustion engine counterpart, it will make their shift to the luxury segment faster, he added. \"So for us, if customers are looking into TCO as a value proposition, I think the shift to EV can help them to accelerate their jump into the luxury segment even faster,\" Iyer said. He further said, \"A car (EQA) at this price point, at this configuration, will help us get new customers. More importantly, it may get new first-time luxury buyers into the EV segment because the total cost of ownership is cheaper than a (internal) combustion engine vehicle\". Iyer, however, said Mercedes-Benz India will address the whole spectrum from entry-level luxury to top-end with its EV portfolio and will launch two top-end luxury electric vehicles later this year. \"We will shortly announce the EQS Maybach SUV, which will be (priced) more than Rs 3 crore, a top-end EV,\" he said, adding that the model showcases how luxury can be combined with sustainability at the top post level. On the performance side, he said, \"We will also have the electrified G-Class, which will be priced over Rs 3 crore. The bookings for it are open from today\". From EQA to EQS Maybach SUV and electrified G-Class, Iyer said, \"The three launches for this year clearly show our dominance from entry luxury to the top-end segment\". With the current models like the EQE and EQB, which are further enriched with two more variants, he said, \"These clearly show a statement of intent to have more product offerings in the EV segment\". On the outlook for the rest of the year, Iyer said, \"We have new products coming up for the upcoming festive season. So, we feel we should be able to close the year with a double-digit growth as projected earlier\". The company reported a 9 per cent growth at 9,262 units in sales in India in the first half of 2024. Its electric vehicle portfolio grew by 60 per cent in H1 2024, comprising 5 per cent of total sales volumes. In 2023, the company recorded its best-ever year in its history in India with sales of 17,408 units, a growth of 10 per cent.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: India will import coking coal from Mongolia on a trial basis from later this month, two sources familiar with the matter said, as New Delhi seeks to diversify imports of the key steelmaking raw material to cut over-reliance on Australia. Steelmakers including JSW Steel and the state-owned Steel Authority of India (SAIL) are poised to receive coking coal shipments from Mongolia after months of negotiations, said the sources, who did not wish to be named in line with official rules. India's Ministry of Steel, JSW Steel, and SAIL did not immediately respond to Reuters emails seeking comments. JSW Steel is expected to receive around 30,000 metric tons of coking coal from Mongolia and SAIL is likely to get 3,000 to 5,000 metric tons, the sources said.     For JSW Steel, this would be the second such shipment after 2021, when India's biggest steel maker bought 8,000 metric tons of coking coal from Mongolia, the sources said.     The supplies would come to India via Chinese ports, but Indian authorities do not think New Delhi should entirely rely on China for steady supplies of coking coal from Mongolia, the sources said. Relations between India and China have been tense since the biggest military confrontation in decades on their disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian and at least four Chinese soldiers in June 2020. Thousands of troops remain mobilised on each side.     India is trying to figure out alternate routes for the supplies of Mongolian coking coal to India, the sources said, without giving details. Indian mills have asked the government to step in and help work out the routes that would ensure regular supplies of coking coal from Mongolia, which offers superior grades, they added. Without a viable and dependable route, Mongolia, rich in mineral resources, struggles to sell raw materials to countries such as India. Some Indian companies are also looking at either acquiring or leasing coal and copper assets in Mongolia. Indian steel companies consume around 70 million metric tons of coking coal annually, and imports constitute around 85 per cent of the country's total requirements.     Steel mills in India, the world's second-biggest crude steel producer, have struggled with volatile supplies of coking coal from Australia, which normally accounts for more than half of India's annual imports.     Indian steelmakers have stepped up coking coal imports from Russia in recent months to take advantage of cheaper prices - a result of Western sanctions targeting Moscow for the war in Ukraine.     During the first half of 2024, Russia emerged as India's third-biggest supplier of coking coal by selling it 3.3 million metric tons, data from commodities consultancy BigMint showed.",

In a letter to Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly V D Satheesan said the current system has resulted in long queues and inconvenience for consumers at gas agencies. He suggested setting up a special system at the ward level and Akshaya Centres to ease the process. \"It has been learned that the Central government has mandated mustering for gas connections in order to ensure that LPG cylinders are held by legitimate customers. Though mustering is imperative to identify legitimate customers, the decision to complete the mustering process at respective gas agencies has caused inconvenience to common LPG holders,\" the letter said. \"As you are aware, majority of the LPG holders are women, and this stipulation has forced them to stand in long lines in front of gas agencies for hours to get the mustering completed. This has severely impacted their day-to-day lives. The elderly population and the bedridden are also in dire straits due to this decision,\" he said. Alternative methods that can be considered are the establishment of specific stations for ward-level mustering and mustering through Akshaya centres, the Congress leader said.",

            "articleBody": "Power demand in North India surged by 22 per cent year-on-year as the region faced a prolonged heatwave in June 2024, according to a report by CRISIL Market Intelligence &amp; Analytics (MI&amp;A). Temperatures soared 5-8&deg;C above normal, significantly increasing the use of cooling appliances and driving up power consumption.The heatwave's impact was also felt in other parts of the country, with power consumption rising by 8.3 per cent in the northeastern region, 7.8 per cent in the eastern region, and 3.5 per cent in the western region. However, the southern states experienced a 5.1 per cent decline in power demand.Despite the early arrival of the southwest monsoon, 38 per cent of districts across India received deficient rainfall between June 1 and July 4, exacerbating the power demand situation. The northern region, in particular, was hit hard, with half of its 209 districts registering deficient rainfall.The report highlights that Real-Time Market (RTM) volumes on the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) in the northern region jumped by 181 per cent in June. This surge in demand was accompanied by a limited price increase of 8 per cent, thanks to higher supply from coal and gas plants.Nationally, power demand rose by 8 per cent year-on-year to 152 billion units (BU) in June, following a 14 per cent year-on-year growth in May. Economic activity also played a crucial role in this demand increase, with the Purchasing Managers Index climbing to 58.3 in June from 57.5 in May. Peak power consumption reached 245.41 GW in June, following a historic high of 250 GW in May.The report indicates that the short-term power market is booming, with RTM volumes increasing by 20 per cent year-on-year in June. This rise reflects the need for immediate delivery during periods of sudden high power requirements, with RTM volume share on the IEX rising to 30 per cent in June from an average of 23 per cent since its inception in June 2020.The combination of a severe heatwave and robust economic activity has led to a significant increase in power demand across India, particularly in the northern region. This trend is expected to continue as the monsoon season progresses and districts continue to experience deficient rainfall.",

Prompted by recent disasters at energy storage facilities, authorities have already carried out safety inspections at some energy storage manufacturers, developers and operators, the report said. A June 26 fire at a lithium battery factory in Seoul, sparked by battery explosions, killed 23 people, most of them Chinese migrant workers, making it one of the deadliest industrial accidents in recent years. In March, following a fire at a commercial energy storage facility in China's Wenzhou, in eastern Zhejiang province, the local National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) ordered a round of inspections and fire safety upgrades. Many of China's energy storage plants at renewables facilities, built to fulfil local government mandates, have been little used and could unknowingly pose safety risks, the 21st Century report added, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Looking to boost the use of renewable electricity by smoothing out fluctuations in wind and solar generation, China has in recent years built the world's largest battery energy storage fleet, mostly using lithium ion batteries. But fire risk remains a concern with the technology, especially with lower-quality batteries, experts say. The NDRC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on Monday. The Ministry of Emergency Management could not immediately be reached for comment. ",

            "articleBody": "Maruti Suzuki India plans to utilise Indian Railways to transport 35 per cent of the vehicles produced across its factories over the next 7-8 years, according to MD and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi. The share of vehicle dispatches through railways scaled to 21.5 per cent in the 2023-24 fiscal from 5 per cent in 2014-15.  The country's largest carmaker's vehicle dispatches through railways increased from 65,700 units in 2014-15 to 4,47,750 units in 2023-24.  \"With our production capacity nearly doubling from about 2 million units to 4 million units by FY 2030-31, we plan to augment the use of railways in vehicle dispatches, close to 35 per cent over the next 7-8 years,\" Takeuchi stated.  Maruti Suzuki has so far dispatched over 20 lakh units through Indian Railways. The automaker ferries vehicles to 20 destinations, serving over 450 cities using Indian railways.  Takeuchi said the company pioneered the use of railways for vehicle dispatches over a decade ago by becoming the first company in India to obtain the Automobile-Freight-Train-Operator license.  Since then, the company has systematically increased its share of vehicle dispatches using railways, he added.  \"Through our sustained efforts in green logistics, we have achieved outstanding results including cumulative reduction of 10,000 metric tonne of CO2 emissions and 270 million litre of cumulative fuel savings,\" Takeuchi noted.  The company stands committed to the country's net zero emissions target by 2070, he added.  Earlier this year, under the PM Gati Shakti programme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the country's first automobile in-plant railway siding at Maruti Suzuki's Gujarat facility.  This facility has a capacity to dispatch 3 lakh vehicles per annum.  The next in-plant railway siding is in progress at the company's Manesar facility and will be operational soon, the automaker stated.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism aims to treat imported goods the same as EU-produced goods to help global decarbonisation, the Director-General of the European Commission has said following a visit to India to discuss tax and custom issues. Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is the European Union's planned tax on the carbon emitted while making goods imported from countries like India and China. The move has sparked a debate at multilateral forums, including the United Nations climate conferences, as the poorer countries fear such tariffs will harm livelihoods and economic growth.Director-General of the European Commission, Gerassimos Thomas, led a group of officials to New Delhi to discuss tax and customs issues, with a focus on CBAM, on July 1 and 2. He met the Indian government officials and business leaders to explore the manner in which it might affect the Indian industries and explain CBAM's goals and timeline.Thomas welcomed India's plans to decarbonise its economy, underlining the shared commitment to collaborate with India in their decarbonisation efforts, the European Commission said in a statement.\"My mission was an excellent opportunity to have direct, in-depth and meaningful interactions with my Indian counterparts and business representatives on a wide range of tax and customs matters, as well as CBAM. The importance of EU-India relations is growing. Both sides want to deepen this relationship to benefit business,\" Thomas said.Through CBAM, the EU hopes to set a price on the carbon emitted to make energy-intensive products like iron, steel, cement, fertiliser and aluminium in other countries. The aim is to both reduce emissions from imports and create a level-playing field for goods made in the European bloc that must meet stricter green standards.The developing countries are worried that the tax under the EU's planned CBAM would harm their economies and make it too expensive to trade with the bloc.\"Europe is a net importer of CBAM goods and wants to make sure that we continue importing goods with the lowest possible carbon intensity to contribute to decarbonisation at a global level. CBAM ensures that imported goods are treated equally to goods produced in the EU.\"It does not discriminate and has a very gradual phase-in to give maximum predictability for investors and businesses,\" the Director-General said.He said the visit was an opportunity to listen, learn and improve.\"To listen to the challenges that Indian businesses face when implementing CBAM. To learn, for example, if and how Indian Micro-Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) are possibly affected (as the CBAM measure normally affects only big enterprises). And to reiterate and jointly explore efforts to adapt and improve the CBAM measure,\" Thomas said.Technical meetings with the Ministry of Power, including the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, will continue. An assessment report on the transition period will be submitted to the Council and the European Parliament before the end of next year and will be public, thereby providing the opportunity for Indian industry and authorities to comment and discuss with the European Commission the next steps.Above and beyond CBAM, the visit confirmed the mutual interest in deepening the exchanges on respective carbon trading markets, pricing mechanisms and EU cooperation with India in the domain of energy efficiency, renewables and clean tech.On taxation, the Director-General discussed with his Indian government counterparts the 'Two-Pillar Solution' to address the tax challenges of the digitalisation of the economy. India confirmed its commitment to 'Pillar 2'.Regarding the UN Framework Convention on international tax cooperation, it was mutually agreed that the overlap between the different tracks should be avoided, the statement said.The EU and India have had a long-standing Customs Cooperation (CCMAA Agreement) since 2004. Director-General Thomas used this week's interactions to focus on the latest challenges of customs -- cross-border e-commerce and designer drug precursors, it said.India agreed to reinforce the bilateral ties on this and have closer cooperation on notably designer drug precursors under the existing CCMAA Agreement. Ongoing negotiations for an EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) include an upgrade of this customs cooperation, the statement said.",

Modi's official visit on July 9-10 comes when India and Austria mark 75 years of their diplomatic relations. Jawaharlal Nehru travelled to Austria in 1955 in the first prime ministerial visit since diplomatic ties were established in 1949. \"India and Austria have had a regular exchange of visits including at the level of leaders, ministers and parliamentarians highlighting the importance that both countries accord to further strengthening their relations,\" according to a profile of India-Austria bilateral relations put up on the website of the Ministry of External Affairs. It also shares the history of PM-level and President-level visits from India to Austria. Then prime minister Indira Gandhi visited Austria in 1971 which was followed by the visit of then Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky in 1980. Gandhi's visit in 1983 was followed by the visit of then chancellor Fred Sinowatz in 1984, it said. Gandhi was in Vienna from June 16-18 during her 1983 visit, people familiar with the matter said. While there have been no prime ministerial visits from India since Indira Gandhi's visit, there have been President-level visits to the country. The then president K R Narayanan visited Austria in 1999; then president Heinz Fischer visited in 2005; then Austrian Vice Chancellor Josef Proll in 2010; and then president Pratibha Devisingh Patil in 2011, according to the profile on the MEA website. Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra on Friday briefed media about Prime Minister Modi's upcoming tour to Russia and Austria from July 8-10. The prime minister will pay an official visit to Moscow on July 8-9 at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin for the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit. In the second leg of the trip, Modi will be visiting Austria on July 9-10 at the invitation of the Chancellor of Austria. \"This will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Austria. Prime Minister had met then Austrian Chancellor, who's now the Foreign Minister, His Excellency Schallenberg, in October 2021 on the sidelines of COP26 in Glasgow. \"The last prime ministerial visit from India to Austria took place more than 40 years ago,\" the foreign secretary said. Modi during his visit will call on the President of Austria and \"hold restricted delegation-level talks as also a high-level business engagement in Austria\" besides having an interaction with the Indian community in Vienna. Kwatra said Austria offers \"excellent opportunities\" for bilateral cooperation in infrastructure, renewable energy, high technology areas, start-up sectors, media and entertainment. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had visited Austria from December 31, 2022, to January 3, 2023. During the visit, he had met with Austrian Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen, Chancellor Karl Nehammer and President of the National Counci, Wolfgang Sobotka. He held delegation-level talks with the Austrian Foreign Minister, Alexander Schallenberg. Five agreements were also signed during the visit, according to the bilateral relations profile dated June 2023. During Austrian Foreign Minister Schallenberg's visit to India in 2022, both ministers had discussed the \"entire gamut of bilateral relations, including political, economic, commercial and consular ties\". Ahead of his visit to Austria, Prime Minister Modi on Sunday said the shared values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law form the bedrock upon which the two countries will build an ever-closer partnership. Modi's remark came a day after Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer posted on 'X', \"I very much look forward to welcoming Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, the world's largest democracy, next week in Vienna.\" \"This visit is a special honour as it marks the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister in over 40 years and a significant milestone as we celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations with India,\" he said. \"We will have the opportunity to talk about further deepening our bilateral relationship and closer cooperation on the many geopolitical challenges,\" the Austrian chancellor said. Responding to Nehammer, Modi said, \"Thank you, Chancellor Karl Nehammer. It is indeed an honour to visit Austria to mark this historic occasion. \"I look forward to our discussions on strengthening the bonds between our nations and exploring new avenues of cooperation.\" Austria is known for its rich cultural and architectural heritage with Vienna renowned for its legacy of orchestral music and legendary composers. \"The visit of India's philosopher-poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore twice to Vienna -- in 1921 and 1926 -- was one of the crucial bridges of cultural and intellectual exchange between India and Austria,\" the MEA website said.",

Landslides buried a person in Shi-Yomi district on Friday, according to a report of the state disaster management department. So far four people have died in the state since April due to natural calamities. The Tezu-Hayuliang road remains blocked at Mompani area in Lohit and Anjaw districts, while landslides blocked the Dari-Chambang and the Palin-Taraklengdi via Langdang village PMGSY road in Kra Daadi district, they said. NH 513 also remained blocked at Geying in East Siang district, a report said. Over 72,900 people and 257 villages have so far been affected by floods and landslides in Arunachal since April this year. Floods and landslides also caused extensive damage to roads, bridges, culverts, power lines, electric poles, transformers and water supply systems. According to the report, 160 roads, 76 power lines, 30 electric poles, three transformers, nine bridges, 11 culverts, and 147 water supply systems have been damaged so far. Besides, 627 kutcha and 51 pucca houses and 155 huts have been damaged, it said. The state capital Itanagar has been reeling under a severe water crisis for the last couple of days due to damage in pipelines. Though the restoration process is on, it will take several days, officials said. Damin, Parsi Parlo and Panyasang administrative circles under Kurung Kumey district are reportedly cut off from the rest of the state, following incessant rain this week that triggered major flashfloods and landslides. Multiple blockades occurred on the road towards Damin via Parsi Parlo, reports said. A massive landslide occurred at Karsingsa block point along the vital NH-415 connecting Itanagar with Banderdewa, forcing the Capital Itanagar administration to close the road for commuters' safety. After a thorough inspection of the site by Deputy Commissioner Shweta Nagarkoti Mehta, it has been decided to close the road and divert all traffic via Gumto.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: Europe's top coal-fired electricity producer cleaned up its power generation act during the first half of 2024, lifting clean electricity generation by more than 25 per cent from the first half of 2024 and cutting fossil fuel-fired output by 9 per cent. Clean power also registered its highest ever share of Turkey's generation mix during the January to June period, supplying 53 per cent of all electricity compared to 44 per cent for the same months in 2023, data from energy think tank Ember shows. Turkey's overall electricity output also climbed, rising by nearly 7 per cent from a year ago to its highest in at least six years, ensuring that total electricity supplies for households and businesses has expanded despite cuts to fossil fuel use. That expansion in total generation contrasts with generation trends across Europe as a whole, where total electricity output remains below prior peaks in several countries due to subdued demand from industry and greater regional energy efficiency.  UNDER PRESSURE Higher overall Turkish electricity generation should start to put pressure on Turkish electricity prices, which remain sharply above long-term average levels since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 roiled regional power markets. Power producers have been under pressure in Turkey to boost total output and cut electricity prices to support economic activity. Turkey's manufacturing sector has struggled with weak orders due to soft regional demand for the goods that Turkey produces and high manufacturing costs due to the country's elevated energy prices. To boost output, power firms have relied on coal to provide a majority of the country's electricity, and so far in 2024 have generated more electricity from coal than Germany and Poland, Europe's next largest coal-fired power producers. But through the first half of 2024 Turkey's power firms have actually been able to cut coal's share of the national generation mix to make way for more clean power output. HYDRO HELP Hydro dams have been the main source of Turkey's clean power this year, with output rising by 37 per cent from the same period in 2023 to the highest since 2020. Increased hydro dam capacity along with heavy rains this spring have fuelled the growth in hydro generation this year. Output from wind and solar farms have also registered double-digit growth during the first half of 2024. Wind generation was a record 17.58 TWh during January through June, while solar output was an all-time high 11.75 TWh, Ember data shows. Coal-fired generation has remained largely flat so far in 2024, at 53.6 TWh. However, gas-fired output has contracted by 26 per cent to the lowest in four years. In turn, that decline in total fossil fuel-fired generation has reduced Turkey's power sector emissions, which fell by 5 per cent to 68.3 million metric tons during the first half from the same months last year.  IMPORT IMPACT Lower overall electricity generation from fossil fuels has meant that Turkey's import needs for power generation fuels also dropped during the first half of the year. Thermal coal purchases contracted by 5 per cent over the first half of 2024 from the first half of 2023 to 9.5 million metric tons, according to ship tracing data from Kpler. Turkey's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) dropped by 28 per cent during the first half of the year to 13.6 million tons, and the lowest for the first half of the year since 2019.  TURNING HIGHER? Turkey's purchases and use of fossil fuels will likely turn higher over the coming months due to the seasonal tendency for hydro power generation to decline sharply from July onwards due to lower rainfall. To make up for that decline in such a key source of clean energy, power firms will likely need to lift generation from coal-fired plants to ensure round-the-clock electricity supplies. In 2023, July and August marked the highest months for coal-fired generation in Turkey that year, just as hydro generation started to fall sharply from its highs during the spring months. In 2024, coal generation trends could well follow the same path and climb during the peak summer months. However, the total coal generation growth may be limited by higher output from solar farms during the sunniest months of the year. And if wind farms can repeat the strong performance seen during last two summers - when output peaked from July through September - Turkey's power firms may be able to keep overall fossil generation in check, and keep clean energy as the primary source of the country's electricity.By Gavin Maguire",

There are no plans for an EV racing series, however, as the car was built as a demonstration vehicle to explore new technologies, said Riley Nelson, NASCAR head of sustainability. The brand-less EV, developed in collaboration with its three auto manufacturing partners Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota and built by NASCAR engineers, stands in stark contrast to the loud, exhaust-spewing muscle cars for which the iconic car racing body is widely known. But the track-tested EV is every bit racecar as its three electric motors are capable of producing 1,000 kW at peak power, NASCAR said, equivalent to around 1,340 horsepower or twice the horsepower churned out by its current Next Gen internal combustion engines. The crossover-bodied car, which debuted at NASCAR's Chicago Street Race on Saturday, featured sustainable materials in place of traditional carbon fibre bodywork. The flax-based composite cuts CO2 emissions by up to 85%, according to Swiss developer Bcomp. NASCAR vowed last year to increasingly decarbonize its operations over the next decade with moves such as sourcing 100% renewable energy at its tracks and offices and expanding EV charging infrastructure around its facilities. A partnership with ABB, which is already involved in the all-electric Formula E racing circuit, will support those goals, NASCAR said. Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed. \"We are in the process of determining measurable KPIs (key performance indicators) around broader electrification initiatives,\" Nelson said. \"ABB installing EV chargers across NASCAR's enterprise is an essential part of how we decarbonize our operation.\"",

            "articleBody": "BRUSSELS: Last month was the hottest June on record, the EU's climate change monitoring service said on Monday, continuing a streak of exceptional temperatures that some scientists said puts 2024 on track to be the world's hottest recorded year. Every month since June 2023 - 13 months in a row - has ranked as the planet's hottest since records began, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin. The latest data suggest 2024 could outrank 2023 as the hottest year since records began after human-caused climate change and the El Nino natural weather phenomenon both pushed temperatures to record highs in the year so far, some scientists said. \"I now estimate that there is an approximately 95% chance that 2024 beats 2023 to be the warmest year since global surface temperature records began in the mid-1800s,\" said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth.  The changed climate has already unleashed disastrous consequences around the world in 2024.  More than 1,000 people died in fierce heat during the haj pilgrimage last month. Heat deaths were recorded in New Dehli, which endured an unprecedentedly long heatwave, and amongst Greek tourists. Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute, said there was a \"high chance\" 2024 would rank as the hottest year on record.  \"El Nino is a naturally occurring phenomenon that will always come and go. We can't stop El Nino, but we can stop burning oil, gas, and coal,\" she said. The natural El Nino phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, tends to raise global average temperatures.  That effect subsided in recent months, with the world now in neutral conditions before cooler La Nina conditions are expected to form later this year. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.  Despite promises to curb global warming, countries have so far failed collectively to reduce these emissions, pushing temperatures steadily higher for decades. In the 12 months ending in June, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for any such period, at 1.64 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period, C3S said.",

            "articleBody": "DHAKA/SINGAPORE: The floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) of Bangladesh's Summit LNG is currently heading to Chittagong port and will arrive there on July 11, according to shiptracking data and a Petrobangla official, after departing Singapore where it was undergoing repairs. The FSRU, also named Summit LNG, departed Singapore on July 6 and passed through the strait of Malacca, according to shiptracking data from LSEG and Kpler. LSEG data lists the vessel's destination as Chittagong. The Petrobangla official said the unit could resume operations in mid-July and added that Bangladesh is importing six cargoes through its long-term deals this month, as well as two additional cargoes from the spot market. The official did not want to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. One spot cargo will arrive in Bangladesh in mid-July, and was awarded to Excelerate Energy at $13.5580 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). The other spot cargo is due to arrive on July 24-25, said the official. Summit LNG did not respond to a request for comment, and U.S.-based Excelerate Energy did not respond outside of its working hours. Summit LNG, the operator of the FSRU, paused operations on the unit after it was damaged by a steel structure when Cyclone Remal lashed Bangladesh in late May, and declared force majeure on liquefied natural gas deliveries. The FSRU was then sent to Singapore for repairs. State-owned Petrobangla, which is tasked with importing LNG for Bangladesh, then cancelled four spot cargoes scheduled for delivery from late May to around mid-June. Bangladesh's gas shortage became more acute after the FSRU was damaged, as the country relies on the fuel to meet power demand for its population of more than 170 million. The FSRU acts as one of Bangladesh's two floating LNG import terminals that supplies gas to the national grid. It has a regasification capacity of 500 million cubic feet per day, and began commercial operations in April 2019. Summit had entered a 15-year charter agreement with Excelerate Energy in 2017 for the FSRU. Excelerate Energy said last month that it is committed to returning it to service in Bangladesh by end-July. ",

Prime Minister Modi will be in Moscow from July 8 to 9 at the invitation of President Putin for the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit. It will be Modi's first visit to Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The two leaders will review the entire range of multifaceted relations between the two countries and exchange views on contemporary regional and global issues of mutual interest, the Ministry of External Affairs said in New Delhi on Thursday while announcing the high-level visit starting on Monday. Speaking to PTI Videos on Modi's visit, Indian Ambassador to Russia Vinay Kumar said that extensive dialogue on trade, economic and investment cooperation and connectivity will be a key focus of discussions during Modi's visit. \"This is a part of annual summits that the two countries have and hence the agenda would be an entire range of issues in our bilateral relationship,\" Kumar said. Asked about likely decisions in the areas of energy and defence, Kumar said \"We have a set of documents that we are working on. Some of those agreements relate to trade and economic ties and also in some new areas of connectivity, and scientific and technological research. So I expect that we would have tangible outcomes in many of these areas.\" Kumar agreed that trade imbalance remained a major area that needed to be addressed, and the matter is likely to be discussed during the prime minister's visit. An uptick in bilateral trade \"has created a situation of significant deficit for India,\" he said while expressing hope that some decisions are likely to address the issue. \"So we will be discussing these issues and also work on expanding the trade basket, commodity-wise as well as volume-wise. Some new areas of exports include agricultural and processed food products, automobile components, engineering goods, and pharmaceuticals,\" he said. This will be Modi's first visit to Russia in nearly five years. His last visit to Russia was in 2019 when he attended an economic conclave in the Far East city of Vladivostok. The annual summit between the Prime Minister of India and the President of Russia is the highest institutional dialogue mechanism in the strategic partnership between the two countries. So far, 21 annual summits have taken place alternately in India and Russia. The last summit was held on December 6, 2021, in New Delhi. President Vladimir Putin had visited India to attend the summit. India's import of discounted Russian crude oil has also gone up significantly notwithstanding the G7 price cap and increasing disquiet over the procurement in many Western capitals. As per figures of the Department of Commerce, in FY 2023-24, bilateral trade has reached an all-time high of USD 65.70 billion, according to the Indian Embassy, Russia. Major items of export from India include pharmaceuticals, organic chemicals, electrical machinery and mechanical appliances, iron &amp; steel, while major items of import from Russia include oil and petroleum products, fertilizers, mineral resources, precious stones and metals, vegetable oils, etc.",

            "articleBody": "India's prime minister begins a two-day visit to Russia on Monday, his first since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, a war that has complicated the relationship between the longtime allies and pushed Russia closer to India's rival China. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit will include a meeting with President Vladimir Putin, whom he last saw in Russia in 2019, in the far eastern port of Vladivostok. The two leaders also met in person in September 2022 in Uzbekistan, at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization bloc.  Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi's importance as a key trading partner for Moscow has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports. Under Modi's leadership, India has avoided condemning Russia's war in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement.  The partnership between Moscow and New Delhi has become fraught, however, since Russia started developing closer ties with India's main rival, China, because of the hostilities in Ukraine.  Modi notably stayed away last week from the most recent summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, in Kazakhstan. Chietigj Bajpaee, senior South Asia research fellow at the U.K.-based Chatham House, said India is becoming increasingly estranged from forums in which Russia and China play a prominent role.  \"This is evident in India's relatively low key presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization last year, and now the decision by Modi not to attend this year's summit,\" Bajpaee said. A confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border dramatically altered their already touchy relationship as the rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Tensions have since persisted despite talks. Those tensions have seeped into how New Delhi looks at Moscow.  \"Russia's relations with China have been a matter of some concern for India in the context of Chinese increased assertiveness in the region,\" D. Bala Venkatesh Verma, a former Indian ambassador to Russia, told The Associated Press. But Modi also will seek to continue close relations with Russia, an important trading partner and major defense supplier for India. Since Western sanctions blocked Russian oil exports after the start of the Ukraine war, India has become a key buyer of Russian oil. It now gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia, according to analysts. India is also strongly dependent on Russia for military supplies, but with Moscow's supply line hit by the fighting in Ukraine, India has been diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the US, Israel, France and Italy. \"Defense cooperation will clearly be a priority area,\" Bajpaee said, adding that 60% of India's military equipment and systems is \"still of Russian origin.\" \"We've seen some delay in the deliveries of spare parts ... following the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\" he said. \"I believe both countries are due to conclude a military logistics agreement, which would pave the way for more defense exchanges.\" India has adopted a neutral stance, neither condemning nor condoning Russia's war on Ukraine, and has called for negotiations to end the fighting. That in turn has bolstered Putin's efforts to counter what he calls the West's domination of global affairs. Facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court for actions over the war in Ukraine, Putin's foreign travel has been relatively sparse in recent years, so Modi's trip could help the Russian leader boost his image. \"We kind of see Putin going on a nostalgia trip - you know, he was in Vietnam, he was in North Korea,\" said Theresa Fallon, an analyst at the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies. \"In my view, he's trying to demonstrate that he's not a vassal to China, that he has options, that Russia is still a great power.\" Alexander Gabuev, head of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that Putin's interactions on the world stage show he \"is far from isolated\" and that Russia is not a country to be discounted.  Trade development also will figure strongly in the talks, particularly intentions to develop a maritime corridor between India's major port of Chennai and Vladivostok, the gateway to Russia's Far East. India-Russia trade has seen a sharp increase, touching close to $65 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, due to strong energy cooperation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters Friday. Imports from Russia touched $60 billion and exports from India $4 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, Kwatra said. India's financial year runs from April to March. He said India was trying to correct the trade imbalance with Russia by increasing its exports. India's top exports to Russia include drugs and pharmaceutical products, telecom instruments, iron and steel, marine products and machinery.  Its top imports from Russia include crude oil and petroleum products, coal and coke, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, fertilizer, vegetable oil, gold and silver.",

            "articleBody": "India is at the forefront of the global fight against climate change, committing to ambitious climate targets emphasising sustainable energy use as a cornerstone of environmental and economic resilience. The country's pledge to reduce carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2070 underscores this commitment.  Energy consumption is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, as more than 75 per cent of India's energy is still sourced from fossil fuels. Without strategic changes, consumption is projected to escalate rapidly with growing urbanisation, industrialisation, and population. Recognising that efficient use of energy can contribute to 40 per cent of the emissions savings goal, India has actively committed to doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Given these monumental goals, tracking progress becomes imperative. Building a future powered by efficient energy use demands a multi-pronged approach, with states as key players. Due to distinctive challenges at the state-level and the considerable influence of sub-national bodies, strong local governance and improved institutional capacities are essential. A data-driven approach offers a crucial pathway to uncover hidden inefficiencies, understand consumption patterns, and identify areas with the highest potential for impact. This approach enables the formulation of tailored energy conservation strategies and the implementation of effective energy efficiency programmes. Building a Robust Data Infrastructure At the heart of a data-driven energy strategy lies the imperative to build a robust data infrastructure. This involves standardising data collection methods across the board and investing in state-level energy databases that can capture, store, and analyse energy consumption data with precision. Without reliable and comprehensive data, it is hard to plan and implement energy efficiency strategies.  The Indian government has intensified efforts to streamline energy data collection and analysis over the past few years. The annual State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI), developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in association with the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE), exemplifies the strides made towards institutionalising data capture, monitoring, and tracking at the state and local levels. Another pivotal move involves the establishment of the Energy Data Management Unit (EDMU) within BEE, aimed at compiling and publishing reliable data on energy supply and consumption across all sectors. Complementing this initiative, NITI Aayog launched the India Climate and Energy Dashboard (ICED) 3.0, offering centralised access to near real-time data on energy, climate, and economic indicators. Additionally, the updated India Energy Security Scenarios (IESS) 2047 (v3.0) includes considerations of emissions, costs, land, and water to support future planning. These combined efforts provide a powerful foundation for informed decision-making.However,there is a persisting gap in capturing accurate and granular information on end-use energy consumption, which is much harder to capture than supply-side energy data. Prioritising delivered energy data and setting up rigorous processes to collect it would empower policymakers to craft targeted efficiency strategies and reduce overall consumption. Additionally, insights into final consumption patterns across sectors enable more precise policy interventions. Leveraging Technology for Enhanced Energy Management Effective energy planning and savings require systems that measure and monitor usage at the point of consumption, ideally down to individual appliances. Technological advancements and rising demand have led to cost-effective, IoT-enabled building energy measurement systems, facilitating a data-driven approach to optimise energy efficiency. These systems track consumption and costs, providing facility managers with real-time insights to improve energy use through smarter consumption and the implementation of energy-efficient technologies and designs.  Drawing inspiration from the likes of the Haryana Renewable Energy Development Agency (HAREDA), Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd (KREDL), and Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) &mdash; all of which have made significant strides in energy savings through the adoption of energy-efficient architecture (green buildings) and the utilisation of high-efficiency appliances &mdash; State Designated Agencies (SDAs) have the opportunity to exemplify energy management. This can be achieved by the meticulous installation and operation of energy management systems, thereby setting a standard for others to follow.  Data for Development A robust data infrastructure is crucial, forming the foundation for informed decision-making at all levels. Quantification is key throughout this process. Data is needed for setting realistic targets, tracking progress, and measuring impact.A data-driven approach should permeate every step &ndash; from crafting policies to implementation, monitoring progress, and evaluating real-world results. India has taken commendable steps towards &lsquo;walking the talk.&rsquo; During its G20 presidency, the focus on &lsquo;data for development&rsquo; highlighted the growing consensus: high-quality data is the backbone of meaningful policymaking, efficient resource allocation, and effective public service delivery. The emphasis on data-driven decision-making is a clarion call to intensify our efforts in the energy space. Innovation and investment in energy efficiency solutions are key, not just for achieving climate goals but for building a future where sustainable energy consumption is the cornerstone of development.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI:With a rise in the number of fire incidents in summer months in the national capital, power regulator DERC has proposed that residential buildings that are over 15 metres high will have to obtain a no objection certificate of the fire safety department for getting an electricity connection. The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has also mooted authorising discoms to disconnect power supply of buildings to be demolished by the civic agencies. The DERC issued a notice for amendments to the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (Supply Code and Performance Standards) Regulations, 2017. in exercise of the powers conferred \"by Section 57 read with Section 181(2)(za) of the Electricity Act, 2003 (Act 36 of 2003)\" .  As per Regulation No 10(7) of the principal regulations, the discoms may disconnect the supply of electricity in case a direction or order for demolition of the premises is passed by a Court, or DDA or MCD or Competent Statutory Authority, said the notice.  Further, Regulation 10 (8) stipulates that in case the dwelling Unit is above the height of 15 meters without stilt parking or is above the height of 17.5 meters with stilt parking, the electricity connection will not be provided unless the fire clearance certificate from the competent authority has been obtained and has to be produced when asked for by the discom.  The DERC has published the draft Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (Supply Code and Performance Standards) (Sixth Amendment) Regulations, 2024 seeking suggestions and objections from the stakeholders including general public.  The norm of fire safety certificate for the specified buildings will become more strictly enforceable after it becomes part of the DERC regulations, discom officials said.  Fire-related calls surged in May-June this year due to unprecedented heat leading to loss of life and property in the city.  The Delhi Fire Services (DFS) received 183 fire-related, calls on May 28-29. From January 1 to May 26, the department received 8,912 fire-related calls.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: US short-seller Hindenburg Research had shared an advance copy of its damning report against Adani group with New York-based hedge fund manager Mark Kingdon about two months before publishing it and profited from a deal to share spoils from share price movement, according to market regulator Sebi. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), in its 46-page show cause notice to Hindenburg, detailed how the US short seller, the New York hedge fund and a broker tied to Kotak Mahindra Bank benefited from the over USD 150 billion routs in the market value of Adani group's 10 listed firms post-publication of the report. Sebi charged Hindenburg of making \"unfair\" profits from \"collusion\" to use \"non-public\" and \"misleading\" information and induce \"panic selling\" in Adani Group stocks. Hindenburg, which made public the Sebi notice, in its response, has described the show cause as an attempt to \"silence and intimidate those who expose corruption and fraud perpetrated by the most powerful individuals in India\" and revealed that the vehicle used to bet against Adani's flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd belonged to Kotak Mahindra (International) Ltd, a Mauritius-based subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. KMIL's fund placed bets on Adani Enterprises Ltd for its client Kingdon's Kingdon Capital Management. Sebi notice includes extracts of time-stamped chats between an employee of the hedge fund and KMIL traders for selling future contracts in AEL. Kotak Mahindra Bank has stated that Kingdon \"never disclosed that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price-sensitive information\". Sebi -- which last year told a Supreme Court-appointed panel that it was investigating 13 opaque offshore entities that held between 14 per cent and 20 per cent across five publicly traded stocks of the Adani group -- has sent notices not just to Hindenburg but also to KMIL, Kingdon and Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson. Senior lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani, who had in the past spoken for the Adani group, in a post on X claimed that Kingdon had a Chinese link. Kingdon is married to \"Chinese spy\" Anla Cheng, he claimed. \"Accomplished Chinese spy Anla Cheng, who along with her husband Mark Kingdon, hired Hindenburg for a research report on Adani, engaged the services of Kotak to facilitate a trading account to short sell Adani shares; made millions of dollars from their short selling; eroded Adani market cap enormously,\" he alleged. Kingdon, which had a controlling stake in KMIL's K-India Opportunities Fund Ltd, had a pact to share with Hindenburg 30 per cent of profit made from trading in securities based on the report, the Sebi letter said, adding this profit share was cut to 25 per cent due to the extra time and effort needed to reroute trades via the K India fund. The market regulator said Kingdon transferred USD 43 million in two tranches to build short positions in AEL. The K India fund built short positions for 8,50,000 shares ahead of the report release and squared off these positions soon after the report was released. According to Sebi, Hindenburg published a report titled 'Adani Group: How the World's 3rd Richest Man is Pulling The Largest Con in Corporate History' on January 24, 2023 (United States time - January 25, 2023, according to IST) during pre-market hours. \"Prior to the release of the Hindenburg Report, concentration in short-selling activity was observed in the derivatives of Adani Enterprises Ltd,\" it said. \"Pursuant to the release of the said report, the price of AEL fell by around 59 per cent during the period from January 24, 2023 to February 22, 2023\" -- from Rs 3,422 to Rs 14,04.85 per share. Sebi said K India Opportunities Fund Ltd - Class F (KIOF Class F) opened a trading account and started trading in the scrip of AEL just a few days prior to the publication of the report and then squared off its entire short position post-publication of the Hindenburg Report, making significant profits of Rs 183.23 crore (USD 22.25 million). \"The net profit after trading and legal expenses comes to USD 22.11 million,\" Sebi said. As part of the deal, Kingdon owned Hindenburg USD 5.5 million, of which USD 4.1 million had been paid as of June 1, the notice said. In its response to Sebi, Kingdon Capital said it had got legal option that it could \"enter into a research services agreement with a third-party firm that publicly releases short reports on companies, pursuant to which Kingdon Capital would be given a draft copy of the report before it is made publicly available and would have the opportunity to accordingly made investments before the report's public dissemination\". A show-cause notice is often a precursor to formal legal action that may include imposing financial penalties and barring participation in the Indian capital market. Sebi can also seek government help to geoblock the research firm's website. Sebi has given Hindenburg 21 days to respond to its allegations. Hindenburg, which published the Sebi notice on its website, in its response stated that it made just USD 4.1 million from its declared positions on Adani stocks and criticised the regulator for not focusing its investigation into the January 2023 report \"providing evidence\" of the conglomerate creating \"a vast network of offshore shell entities\" and moving billions of dollars \"surreptitiously\" into and out of Adani public and private entities. It said that while Sebi was seeking to claim jurisdiction over a US-based investor, the regulator's notice \"conspicuously failed to name the party that has an actual tie to India: Kotak Bank,\" which created and oversaw the offshore fund structure used by Hindenburg's investor partner to bet against Adani. The regulator \"masked the \"Kotak\" name with the acronym \"KMIL\", it added. KMIL refers to Kotak Mahindra Investments Ltd, the asset management company.",

            "articleBody": "Islamabad: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said a new era of Pakistan-China cooperation in the information technology (IT), communication, mining, and energy sectors has dawned and will lead to economic development and deepening of the time-tested bilateral relationship. Sharif's remarks came as he chaired a review meeting in Islamabad on Saturday on the implementation of agreements and MOUs reached during his recent visit to China, Radio Pakistan reported.  The prime minister said that the promotion of Pakistan-China cooperation in these fields will lead to economic development, strengthening of regional ties, and deepening of the relations between the two countries.  Referring to the time-tested Pak-China friendship, he said that China had always supported Pakistan in difficult times. \"China has emerged as the strongest economic power and Pakistan can emulate its development,\" he added.  The 72-year-old Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader said that no disruption will be tolerated in the implementation of agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) signed during his visit to China, announcing to personally monitor the implementation of these agreements and MoUs.  The prime minister was also briefed about a delegation of Chinese shoemaking companies recently visiting Pakistan to shift their manufacturing units to the cash-strapped country and that the Chinese companies have the potential to invest USD 5-8 billion in this sector.  Regarding the agriculture sector, he was apprised that 12 leading companies of China will participate in the Food and Agri Expo to be held in Pakistan this year.  Sharif also reviewed the progress regarding sending 1,000 students from Pakistan to China on government scholarships for advanced training in the agriculture sector.  He directed that students from all four provinces, including Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), should be sent to China on the basis of merit, while students from backward areas of Balochistan should be given special priority in the programme.  Sharif instructed to start sending students for modern agricultural training in China from the next academic semester.  Besides, the meeting was told that over 100 Chinese companies are in contact with Pakistani companies for business and investment.  The meeting was also briefed about the progress on the technical training of 3,00,000 students by Huawei, a one-stop operation to facilitate business, smart governance and smart city.  The prime minister was also apprised of the progress made by China on various communication, infrastructure, and electricity projects in Gwadar.  Sharif advised expediting measures for the development of Gwadar Seaport, Gwadar Airport, and Gwadar Industrial Zone to make Gwadar the hub of trade corridor in the region.  He also instructed to speed up the negotiations with Chinese solar panels and equipment manufacturing companies to move their factories to Pakistan.  The 72-year-old leader embarked on his first visit to China after he took over as prime minister for the second term after his PML-N party-led coalition government assumed power in March.  Addressing the Pakistan-China Business Forum last month, Sharif assured all-out facilitation to Chinese investors and the security of Chinese individuals, projects, and investments in Pakistan.  He said his government had taken various measures to ensure fool-proof security to protect the lives of Chinese workers in Pakistan.  Five Chinese nationals and a Pakistan driver were killed in a suicide attack in Dasu in March. Pakistan paid USD 2.58 million as compensation to the families of those killed in the attack.",

            "articleBody": "Islamabad: Pakistan is expected to get an investment of USD 5 billion over the next three years from local and international firms for the exploration and development of petroleum and gas reserves that will save the cash-strapped country's valuable foreign exchange and provide relief to the common man bearing the brunt of high fuel prices. The announcement was made in a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday during a meeting with a delegation of oil and gas exploration and production sector companies. According to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, the meeting was informed that during three years, around 240 places would be excavated with an investment of USD 5 billion to explore petroleum and gas in Pakistan. The meeting was informed that currently, Pakistan's domestic production stood at 70,998 barrels and 3,131 MMSCFD (million standard cubic feet) gas per day. The prime minister invited petroleum and gas exploration and production companies to also find offshore reserves. \"Exploring the oil and gas reserves at the local level in Pakistan is our top priority,\" Prime Minister Sharif said, adding that Pakistan spent billions of dollars every year on importing oil and gas. \"Production from local reserves will save Pakistan's valuable foreign exchange and fuel and gas will become affordable for the common man,\" he added and directed the concerned authorities to provide solutions to all the problems of the sector on a priority basis. Currently, the price of petrol in Pakistan is Rs. 265.61/Ltr, high-speed diesel is Rs. 277.45/Ltr and light-speed diesel is Rs 166.86/Ltr. The prime minister constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar that would include experts, secretaries and the relevant authorities. The committee, after consultation with the representatives of the sector, would formulate proposals to create an attractive policy for the exploration and development of petroleum and gas reserves in Pakistan. Sharif directed the relevant authorities to solve all the problems of the sector and submit policy proposals to the constituted committee on priority. The delegation thanked the prime minister for making the petroleum and gas exploration and production sector a part of the consultation process, listening to their problems and finding serious solutions to them.",

The Noida-based company recently inaugurated its first CBG pump in Mau district in Uttar Pradesh, marking its entry to execute engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services in the clean energy sector. \"The company's commitment to clean energy goes far beyond this single pump. Plans are afoot to open a total of 5,000 green diesel and CBG pumps across the country in multiple phases over the next 10 years, with each pump costing around Rs 3 crore. In this manner, we are set to invest Rs 15,000 crore in the green energy sector,\" NexGen Energia Chairman Piyush Dwivedi told PTI. \"Furthermore, this initiative will create approximately 5,000 new entrepreneurs and provide direct and indirect employment to over 10 lakh people. Our goal is to make India self-reliant in the green energy sector, thereby reducing fuel imports by about 30 per cent,\" Dwivedi said. He said the company's vision goes beyond merely providing clean fuel as it is actively working to build a robust infrastructure to facilitate a sustainable future for transportation in India. \"This significant expansion is expected to attract a substantial investment into the Indian economy, which will spur significant economic growth,\" the chairman added. Earlier in April, Nexgen Energia's e-mobility arm NGE launched its affordable fleet of two-wheeler electric vehicles (EVs), with prices starting at Rs 36,999. The company had said it aims to cross sales of more than Rs 500 crore this financial year and set up more than 500 dealers and distributors while generating around 50,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities in the EV sector. There are plans to introduce electric trucks and buses, which will further strengthen the company's commitment to sustainable mobility solutions, it added.",

The country's coal import was 49.62 MT in April and May in FY24, according to data compiled by mjunction services ltd -- a B2B e-commerce platform from a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL.  However, coal import in May dropped marginally to 26.19 MT, from 26.57 MT a year earlier.  \"Coal imports... were down 1.43 per cent as against 26.57 MT imported in May 2023,\" it said.  According to mjunction MD and CEO Vinaya Varma, the demand for imports is likely to remain subdued in the coming weeks due to the onset of monsoon while the production growth should stay healthy in the domestic market.  Also, coking coal prices are expected to move up in the seaborne market due to supply tightness and this may impact buyers' interest in the country.  Of the total imports in May, non-coking coal imports stood at 17.53 MT, against 18.10 MT imported in May last year. Coking coal import volume was 5.03 MT, against 5.10 TMT imported in May 2023.  Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.  After taking charge as coal and mines minister, G Kishan Reddy had said India should increase domestic production of the fossil fuel and reduce coal imports.  Reddy had said that 10 years ago there was coal shortage in the country which resulted in electricity shortage. But in the last 10 years there has been sufficient power availability, he said.",

Officials of CESC which supplies electricity to Kolkata and Howrah, however, claimed that no tariff changes have been effected but fuel cost was adjusted in June. \"I heard they (CESC) have increased rates, but I have no information on the hike. The power department also does not have any knowledge about it,\" she said. Stating that prices of essentials are already high, she said that CESC should have spoken to the state government regarding the hike in its rates. \"We expect this much to be done,\" the chief minister said. CESC officials said that the fuel adjustment for April has effected a 5.7 per cent increase in bills for June, from when it was effected. The officials claimed it is a laid-down regulation for utilities to adjust the fuel cost. They said the gross average tariff remains Rs 7.73 per unit.",

            "articleBody": "A group of Hyundai Motor dealers has sued the South Korean automobile giant in Chicago federal court for allegedly inflating sales numbers for electric vehicles while punishing franchises that would not participate in the ruse. The lawsuit, filed on Friday by Napleton Aurora Imports in Illinois and affiliated franchises, said Hyundai Motor America Corp (HMA) pressured dealers to misuse inventory codes meant for \"loaner\" vehicles to exaggerate their sales figures. Dealers that agreed to improperly code the vehicles were rewarded by Hyundai with wholesale and retail price discounts and other incentives, according to the lawsuit. Hyundai said in a statement on Monday that it does not condone falsifying sales data and had opened an investigation after it was alerted to the allegations. The company also said it has been pursuing litigation in South Florida to terminate two Napleton-affiliated franchises there tied to a criminal sexual battery allegation. An attorney for the Napleton plaintiffs declined to comment on Monday. The complaint in Chicago accused Hyundai of fraud and violating the Robinson-Patman Act, a federal antitrust law that bars sellers from discriminating on the basis of price. Dealers that \"played ball,\" according to the lawsuit, would receive extra inventory of faster selling Hyundai models. The lawsuit said the scheme put desirable inventory in the hands of fewer dealers, depriving customers of choice, while helping Hyundai tout rosy sales figures to the public and investors. It said Hyundai has emphasized its sales-volume growth for electric vehicles, leading the public to believe demand was market driven. \"Instead of organic growth fueled by desirable vehicles and consumer demand, HMA created a multitiered scheme to cause its dealers to report false sales,\" the complaint said. The lawsuit cited statements on a phone call from a Hyundai district sales manager who said \"we gotta hit a number for the press and for the Koreans.\" The dealers said they have been denied benefits from Hyundai and asked the court to award an unspecified amount of damages to cover lost sales, revenue and profit. Napleton reached a settlement with Chrysler in 2019 after it sued the automaker in 2016 for allegedly scheming to inflate sales figures. Chrysler denied the claims, and the settlement terms were confidential. Chrysler in a related action agreed in 2019 to pay $40 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve claims it misled investors over allegedly inflated monthly sales figures.  The case is Napleton Aurora Imports Inc et al v. Hyundai Motor America Corp, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, No. 1:24-cv-05668.

Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd. are closing in on Hyundai Motor Co.&rsquo;s No. 2 position in India, putting pressure on the South Korean automaker just as it prepares for a record USD 3.5 billion listing of its local unit.While Hyundai has long wrestled with Tata Motors for the second spot, Mahindra &mdash; famed for its big, brash sport utility vehicles &mdash; has been steadily climbing up the charts as Indian consumers embrace ever larger passenger vehicles.Hyundai sold 13.5% of all passenger cars in India last month, while Jaguar Land Rover-owner Tata Motors sold 13.2% versus Mahindra&rsquo;s 12.4%, data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations show. Maruti Suzuki Ltd. is by far and away India&rsquo;s top carmaker, with a 40% share.The tussle for sales in India, one of the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing automobile markets, comes just as Hyundai Motor India Ltd. plans to start gauging investor interest ahead of an expected initial public offering in September or October. An IPO of that size would also be one of Asia&rsquo;s biggest in recent years.Hyundai is a &ldquo;true leader compared to competitors, holding first and second rank in many categories,&rdquo; Hyundai India CEO Unsoo Kim said during an investor presentation last week. But Chief Operating Officer Tarun Garg acknowledged that considering the many foreign automakers that have exited the country, &ldquo;India is not an easy market to crack.&rdquo;Hyundai is spending around 200 billion rupees (USD 2.4 billion) in India to develop electric vehicles &mdash; still a nascent sector in a country whose road transport industry is characterized by older, gas guzzling trucks and cars &mdash; and 70 billion rupees to get its second plant there operational by the back end of 2025.To woo consumers more interested in environmentally friendlier cars, it plans to launch an electric version of its bestselling mid-sized SUV, Creta, in the first quarter of 2025, according to the investor presentation.Tata Motors meanwhile is expanding its EV portfolio by adding 10 models by fiscal 2026. Mahindra plans to invest 270 billion rupees over the next three years to add capacity for making SUVs, as well as EVs. It hopes to launch nine diesel and gas-powered SUVs and seven EVs by 2030. Maruti Suzuki, although it leads India&rsquo;s car market, currently doesn&rsquo;t sell any battery-powered cars.&ldquo;If some market share is lost by Hyundai, that can largely be attributed to product range,&rdquo; said Deven Choksey, managing director at KR Choksey Shares &amp; Securities Pvt.Tata Motors and Mahindra, with their appealing designs and competitive pricing, are &ldquo;extremely challenging brands for all carmakers in India today,&rdquo; Choksey said.",

            "articleBody": "TOKYO: Private equity firm KKR plans to cut its stake in Kokusai Electric, two people familiar with the matter said, cashing in after a blistering run for shares in the Japanese chip equipment maker. KKR, which holds around 43 per cent of Kokusai's shares, plans to sell about half of its stake to investors, one of the people said.  Kokusai will buy back shares in the market, the person said. A 20 per cent stake in Kokusai is worth roughly $1.6 billion as at Monday's closing price. KKR and Kokusai declined to comment. Shares in the manufacturer of deposition equipment, which was spun out of Hitachi Kokusai Electric in 2018, have roughly tripled since an initial public offering in October. Kokusai, which was originally part of Hitachi, has been a test case for private equity in Japan as conglomerates shed non-core assets and companies go private. With chips seen as underpinning technological innovation including the growth of artificial intelligence, Kokusai has been buoyed by demand for shares of chip equipment makers. Kokusai, which reported sales of 181 billion yen ($1.12 billion) in the year ended March, has medium-term targets of 330 billion yen or more in sales and adjusted operating margin of 30 per cent or more.  KKR sought to sell Kokusai to U.S. chip competitor Applied Materials in 2019. The deal was terminated after failing to achieve regulatory approval in China. Applied has a 15 per cent stake in Kokusai. Kokusai also competes with Tokyo Electron, whose shares have risen by almost 50 per cent in the year to date. It is exposed to the memory sector and analysts see scope for further expansion in logic.",

            "articleBody": "TOKYO: Honda Motor will halt vehicle production at its factory in Ayutthaya province in Thailand by 2025 as it plans to consolidate its output under the plant it runs in Prachinburi province, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday. The move highlights the tougher conditions Japan's second-biggest automaker faces in the Southeast Asian nation as Chinese brands aggressively seek to gain market share in Thailand and consumer demand for electric vehicles grows. Honda plans to produce car parts at the Ayutthaya plant that was first opened in 1996 when it stops making vehicles there next year, a company spokesperson said. It will consolidate vehicle production at the Prachinburi plant, which was opened in 2016, according to the spokesperson. The factories are the only two plants the automaker has in Thailand. Honda has seen the combined production at the plants fall from 228,000 vehicles in 2019 to under 150,000 a year for each of the four years through 2023. The company's sales in Thailand have been under 100,000 for each of the four years through last year. Honda hopes to get rid of the gap between vehicle production and sales it has seen in Thailand, according to the spokesperson. But the automaker has already been exporting from Thailand, mainly to other Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia and the Philippines, the spokesperson said. Honda has no current plans to make new investments in Thailand, the spokesperson added. In China, Honda and rival Japanese automaker Nissan Motor have been hit especially hard by competition from rising Chinese brands, which have attracted consumers with low-priced, software-loaded EVs and plug-in hybrids. Japanese automakers now face a risk of losing customers in markets outside of China, such as those in Southeast Asia, to upstart Chinese brands that are increasingly looking to step up car exports and setting up factories overseas. Last week, China's BYD opened a plant for battery-powered cars in Thailand that is part of a wave of investment worth more than $1.44 billion from Chinese EV makers that are establishing factories in the country.

            "articleBody": "PARIS: Stellantis said on Tuesday it would expand its line of affordable hybrid vehicles to 36 models in Europe by 2026, to meet growing demand for this engine type, an alternative to petrol-fuelled cars and electric vehicles. The American-French-Italian automaker, created from the 2021 merger between Peugeot maker PSA and Fiat Chrysler, said in a statement it would offer 30 hybrid models this year for nine of its 14 brands, including Fiat, Peugeot, Jeep and Alfa Romeo, and launch six more over the following two years. Stellantis, which did not say how many such hybrid models it already sells, said it was responding to the quick ramp-up of customer orders for hybrids in Europe. It added that its sales of this kind of vehicle in the region rose 41% in the first six months this year. The group said in June its EV sales were stable since the beginning of 2024 despite softer demand globally. Stellantis said it was focusing on selling \"mild hybrid\" vehicles, those without a plug and that use a 48-volt low-voltage battery, a dual-clutch robotic gearbox and a reinforced braking energy-recovery system. \"When you compare this system to a high-voltage hybrid, it has a very similar CO2 gain at a lower cost for our customer,\" said Christian Muller, Stellantis' senior vice president of propulsion systems for the EMEA region, referring to its carbon dioxide emissions. \"Our system is as good as the others but with a slightly better price-entry point.\" Stellantis' affordable hybrid technology allows for a range of up to one kilometre in pure electric mode, compared to around 80 kilometres for the group's plug-in hybrid technology.",

The move is aimed at getting the model included in the group of companies that cooperated with the investigation. That would bring duty levels to 20.8%, down from 37.6% under the current plans. Last week, the European Commission announced provisional duties on European imports of electric vehicles produced in China, giving EV producers until July 18 to comment. Models of BMW's Chinese-made electric Mini have only been produced for a few months and were not part of Brussels' sample analysis in the run-up to the tariff announcement, which means they were automatically subjected to the highest tariff level. BMW expects its electric Mini to be ultimately hit with a lower tariff, the person said, adding an official process for new market entrants to seek lower duties would only be made possible in the fall, once final duties have been set. Under the EU process, any company that was not represented in the sample groups and wishes to have its own individual duty can ask for an \"accelerated review\" just after the imposition of definitive measures. BMW declined to comment. ",

            "articleBody": "Istanbul: China's electric vehicle giant BYD on Monday signed a one-billion-dollar agreement with Turkey to open a plant in the country in a move that would help it dodge new EU tariffs.The signing ceremony in Istanbul between BYD's CEO Wang Chuanfu and Turkey's industry and technology minister Fatih Kacir was overseen by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to the Turkish industry and technology ministry, BYD will open a production facility with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles as well as a research and development centre. The plant will provide direct employment for 5,000 people. The news comes days after the European Union slapped additional provisional tariffs of up to 38 percent on Chinese EVs following an investigation that concluded state subsidies meant they were unfairly undermining European rivals.Turkish-made cars enjoy beneficial access to the EU under a customs union that dates to 1995 and the Marmara region around Istanbul has become one of the leading centres of the world's automobile industry.Major carmakers including Fiat and Renault opened plants there at the beginning of the 1970s, with others like Ford, Toyota and Hyundai following, taking advantage of Turkey's position at the crossroads between Europe, Asia and the Middle East. - Incentives -The land that was previously allocated for Volkswagen in Manisa in the north of the Western porty city of Izmir would be given to the Chinese company, the pro-government daily Yeni Safak reported. \"BYD is the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles and one of the most advanced in terms of technology and manufacturing quality,\" independent consultant Levent Taylan told AFP. \"Indeed, this will be an investment for the Turkish market but especially European market, by circumventing the customs tariffs imposed on vehicles of Chinese origin,\" he said. He said BYD has a potential to sell around 20-25,000 vehicles per year on the Turkish market and export 75,000 to the EU. Under new Turkish regulations on investment incentives BYD will be able to circumvent a new 40 percent tariff that Turkey imposed on electric vehicle imports. China has led the global shift to electric vehicles, with almost one in three cars on its roads set to be electric by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency's annual Global EV Outlook.Chinese EV manufacturers have also stepped up exports, prompting many nations to take measures to protect their automakers.They have begun looking at manufacturing abroad, with BYD having already announced plans to open its first European factory in Hungary.In July, BYD opened a factory in Thailand. The plant in Rayong, an industrial area southeast of Bangkok, will be able to build up to 150,000 vehicles a year, according to the company, which dominates its domestic market.Beijing has warned the EU tariff move could spark a trade war.",

            "articleBody": "There are currently about 140 battery stations in Spain, the head of Acciona's mobility business, Carlos Sotelo, said, adding the company was targeting more than 200 by the end of the year.Drive, swap the battery, repeat. Spanish construction and energy group Acciona is betting on this formula to help remove some of the main hurdles hindering the take-up of electric cars in Spain and elsewhere in Europe: price and driving range. The company launched on Monday its NanoCar Silence S04, an electric car designed for urban driving that comes with the option of a subscription-based battery exchange service which its developers say will make it one of the most affordable of its kind on the market. The vehicle can carry two passengers and is designed to work with one or two lithium-ion batteries. Under the subscription system, drivers will own the car but not the batteries. For a monthly fee, they'll be able to swap batteries running out of mileage with new ones at dedicated stations, which the company envisages setting up at petrol stations, malls, its flagship stores, and other places like parking areas.  The batteries can also be charged using domestic sockets, with a full charge taking about eight hours.  Swappable car batteries are relatively uncommon in the EV market, with most trials conducted in China to date.  Being able to swap batteries in roughly 30 seconds addresses concerns around battery range, he said. Selling the vehicle without a battery means it will be cheaper than the average EV, Acciona Chairman Jose Manuel Entrecanales said during a presentation in Madrid. Including state subsidies and tax deductions, the cheapest model will cost less than 7,000 euros (USD 7,582), using the subscription model based on a monthly fee. Buying the battery rather than opting for the subscription model adds a few thousand euros to the price.  \"There are already small electric vehicles, but I believe the NanoCar will be the most affordable on the market due to its removable battery,\" Entrecanales said, while acknowledging the car would have to \"sell a lot to be profitable\". The car will be built at the company's Barcelona facilities, which have the capacity to produce up to 20,000 vehicles a year. Acciona is teaming up with Nissan to market the vehicle in Italy and France, and plans to reach other European markets, including Germany, starting from September.",

            "articleBody": "WASHINGTON: If the Biden administration had its way, far more electronic chips would be made in factories in, say, Texas or Arizona.They would then be shipped to partner countries, such as Costa Rica or Vietnam or Kenya, for final assembly and sent out into the world to run everything from refrigerators to supercomputers.Those places may not be the first that come to mind when people think of semiconductors. But administration officials are trying to transform the world's chip supply chain and are negotiating intensely to do so.The core elements of the plan include getting foreign companies to invest in chipmaking in the United States and finding other countries to set up factories to finish the work. Officials and researchers in Washington call it part of the new \"chip diplomacy.\"The Biden administration argues that producing more of the tiny brains of electronic devices in the United States will help make the country more prosperous and secure. President Joe Biden boasted about his efforts in his interview on Friday with ABC News, during which he said he had gotten South Korea to invest billions of dollars in chipmaking in the United States.But a key part of the strategy is unfolding outside America's borders, where the administration is trying to work with partners to ensure that investments in the United States are more durable.If the nascent effort progresses, it may help the administration meet some of its broad strategic goals. It wants to blunt security concerns involving China, which is growing its chip manufacturing while making threats against Taiwan, a global centre of chip technology. And it wants to lower the risks of disruptions to the chip supply chain -- risks that became evident during the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine, both of which threw global shipping and manufacturing into turmoil.\"The focus has been to do our best to expand the capacity in a diverse set of countries to make those global supply chains more resilient,\" said Ramin Toloui, a Stanford University professor who recently served as assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, which is at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to set up new supply chains.The administration aims to do that not just for chips, but for green energy technology such as electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. China is by far the biggest player in those industries.Biden and his aides say that dominance by Chinese companies is a national security issue as well as a human rights problem, given that some of the manufacturing takes place in Xinjiang, a region of China where officials force members of some Muslim ethnic groups to work in factories.Over three years of the Biden administration, the United States has attracted $395 billion of investment in semiconductor manufacturing and $405 billion for making green technology and generating clean power, Toloui said.Many of the companies investing in that kind of manufacturing in the United States are based in Asian countries known for their tech industries -- Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, for instance -- and in Europe. One is SK Hynix, a South Korean chipmaker that is building a $3.8 billion factory in Indiana. The State Department says that the project is the largest-ever investment in that state and that it has the potential to bring more than 1,000 jobs to the region.Secretary of State Antony Blinken mentioned that project in a speech last month at a conference in Maryland aimed at encouraging foreign investment in the United States. And he underscored how he hoped legislation enacted by Biden would draw foreign investment to U.S. high-tech manufacturing by \"modernising our roads, our rail, our broadband, our electric grid.\"The policy efforts, he added, are aimed at \"strengthening and diversifying supply chains, turbocharging domestic manufacturing, spurring key industries of the future, from semiconductors to clean energy.\"The Commerce Department has also played a major role in the effort to shore up the chip supply chain and is disbursing $50 billion to companies and organisations to research, develop and manufacture chips.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo led an in-depth study of global chip supply chains to identify vulnerabilities and has worked with foreign governments to discuss opportunities for additional investments overseas.The topic was a focus of Raimondo's trip to Costa Rica this past spring as she met with local officials and executives from Intel, which runs a factory there. (Toloui spoke at a semiconductor manufacturing conference in Costa Rica in January.) She also discussed diversifying the semiconductor supply chain on trips to Panama and Thailand.But reworking global supply chains so that they are less dependent on East Asia will be a challenge. East Asian chip factories offer more cutting-edge technology, a larger pool of talented engineers and lower costs than American factories are projected to.Taiwan produces more than 60% of the world's chips and nearly all of the most advanced chips, which are used in computers, smartphones and other devices.By comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry could face a shortage of up to 90,000 workers over the next few years, according to several estimates.Governments in China, Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere are also aggressively subsidising their own chip industries.Still, billions of dollars of new U.S. investment are expected to somewhat shift global supply chains. The U.S. share of global chip manufacturing is projected to rise to 14% by 2032, from 10% today, according to a May report from the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group.Some administration officials have engaged in a more coercive form of chip diplomacy to prevent China from developing versions of American technology. That approach has focused on persuading a handful of countries -- Japan and the Netherlands, in particular -- to stop companies from selling some chipmaking tools to China.Alan Estevez, who leads the bureau within the Commerce Department in charge of export controls, visited Japan and the Netherlands last month to try to persuade the countries to block companies there from selling certain advanced technology to China.By contrast, Toloui and his aides have flown around the world to scout out countries and companies that might want to invest in the American industry and set up factories that would form the endpoint of the supply chain. Toloui said his bureau's work was an element of Biden's recent enactment of legislation to create more manufacturing jobs in the United States, including the infrastructure act and the CHIPS and Science Act.The CHIPS act includes $500 million of funding annually for the administration to create secure supply chains and to protect semiconductor technology. The State Department draws on that money to find countries for supply chain development. Officials are organising studies on a range of countries to see how infrastructure and workforces can be brought up to certain standards to ensure smooth chip assembly, packaging and shipping.The countries now in the program are Costa Rica, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines and Vietnam. The U.S. government is bringing in Kenya.Job training is a priority in this supply chain creation, Toloui said. He has talked to Arizona State University about being a partner with overseas institutions to develop training programs. One such institution is Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City, which he visited in May.Martijn Rasser, managing director of Datenna, a research firm that focuses on China, said this network of alliances was a strategic advantage that the United States has over China.For the United States to try to do everything itself would be too expensive, he said. And going it alone would not recognise the reality that technology today is much more diffused globally than it was a few decades ago, with various countries playing important roles in the chip supply chain.",

            "articleBody": "The world&rsquo;s sleekest dump sits on an island near the picturesque port of Bergen in Norway. Strictly speaking, the gleaming Northern Lights terminal is just the gateway to the actual dump, where carbon dioxide will be offloaded from ships and then pumped down into an aquifer 1.6 miles below the seabed, about 60 miles offshore, keeping it locked away.Getting to net zero mostly means stopping doing things that emit carbon. A supplement to this is capturing those emissions and storing them, like refuse in a landfill. In theory, carbon capture and storage, or CCS, offers the ultimate climate hedge for fossil fuel producers, albeit at a cost of perhaps $10 trillion through 2050.More likely, it will play a vital role in mopping up the most stubborn emissions, but will be outcompeted by faster-moving alternatives for energy transition. Moreover, the incentives required to make it work would present, in themselves, a profound risk to fossil fuel producers.Of the emissions that need to be eliminated to achieve net zero in 2050, Bloomberg NEF projects CCS accounting for 16 per cent of them. The amount being captured annually by 2050, more than 8 gigatons, would be bigger than the total energy-related emissions of the Americas today.  CCS typically involves chemically &ldquo;scrubbing&rdquo; carbon dioxide from the smokestack of, say, a power plant, then using heat to release the gas that&rsquo;s captured before compression, transportation and storage. Another, newer set of technologies under development called direct air capture effectively suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, rather than from chimneys. All of this is quite nascent: Global capture capacity operating today is equivalent to about 0.1 per cent of energy-related emissions.None of this is cheap. Carbon capture on a US gas-fired power plant boosts the cost of its electricity by 54 per cent, factoring in capital and running costs, according to Bloomberg NEF estimates. The cost for industrial processes such as making steel or cement, including transportation and storage, range above $100 per ton, compared with current European carbon futures prices of around $76. As for direct air capture, that costs about 15 times the futures price.  Northern Lights epitomises the role of government in making this work. While it is a joint venture between three oil companies &mdash; Equinor ASA, Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE &mdash; the prime mover is the state. Norway funds 80 per cent of the initial investment, up to a cap, plus some of the operating costs (Equinor is also 67 per cent state-owned). In return, the project won&rsquo;t charge two emitters selected by the government, a cement plant and a waste-to-energy plant near Oslo, to store their carbon dioxide. A second phase will involve commercial customers, with two having signed contracts.&ldquo;The intent is to demonstrate the CCS chain can work and break the loop of &lsquo;who&rsquo;s ever going to invest in this new business?&rsquo;,&rdquo; Tim Heijn, Northern Lights&rsquo; managing director, said when I visited recently. As if to reinforce the showcase aspect, we met in a comfortable auditorium sized, I was told, to accommodate a busload of visitors plus guides. Government backing is needed because carbon dioxide is mostly worthless; it is the gas&rsquo;s absence that has value. Nick Cooper, executive chair of Storegga Ltd., a UK-based CCS developer, draws an analogy with efforts to clean up filthy cities in the 19th century: &ldquo;Ultimately, there was a sea change and people said we need a sewage system to deal with our waste that we had previously been throwing out for free.&rdquo; CCS is a planetary-scale waste management business.Hence, its business model relies on revenue constructed by regulation. This includes subsidies like the generous 45Q tax credit in the US, worth up to $85 per ton, as well as emitters paying for CCS in order to avoid the cost of penalties.Such inducements aim to encourage scale, reducing costs. Projects like Northern Lights and Storegga&rsquo;s embody this as logistical hubs to aggregate emissions from plants across Europe. Similarly, US CCS projects are effectively overlaid on the existing oil and gas and industrial centres of the Gulf Coast.This makes sense but also gets at the challenges of scaling up an industry that is effectively the mirror image of the existing fossil fuel-based industrial system. My first glimpse of Northern Lights&rsquo; towering storage tanks and pipes reminded me of an oil refinery. Success requires proximity to the right geological structures and emitting customers &mdash; an advantage for areas like the North Sea and the US Gulf of Mexico &mdash; plus lots of scrubbers, pipelines, tanks and ships. The International Energy Agency estimates CCS will need somewhere between 60,000 and 360,000 miles of dedicated pipelines, up from less than 6,000 today, to fulfil net-zero ambitions. As for direct capture, the sheer volume of air it must move presents an implacable, and actual, physical headwind.Bigger scale will result in some efficiencies, but CCS is competing with alternatives enjoying much faster learning rates, notably manufactured solar and wind power (another big-project technology, nuclear power, can relate). For example, Bloomberg NEF anticipates the cost of US gas-fired power with carbon capture falling by about 3 per cent-6 per cent a year, through 2030 before flattening out. Renewables, meanwhile, have enjoyed annual cost declines in the mid-teens for years and are already the cheapest source of electricity in most of the world. This presents a particular complication for CCS projections because fossil-fuel generators seeking to curb emissions are expected to be the biggest customer base by far.  Yet any power plant developer considering adding CCS must factor in the risk posed by rising renewables. As the latter take more market share, they squeeze down utilisation of traditional power plants, thereby raising the cost per ton of captured carbon considerably.There is a more robust economic case for CCS in industrial processes such as manufacturing cement, metals and chemicals. The high heat requirements and, in some cases, chemical reactions emitting carbon mean electrification can only get so far in addressing these emissions. One of Northern Lights&rsquo; two commercial contracts signed so far is with a fertiliser and ammonia producer in the Netherlands.Such challenges and uncertainties are Northern Lights hopes to &ldquo;break the loop&rdquo; of low investment. It has its work cut out: CCS investment lags far behind that of other cleantech, which in turn limits the scope for efficiency gains that might unlock more spending.  The point isn&rsquo;t that CCS projects won&rsquo;t get built; they will play a useful role, particularly for industrial sectors. One potentially big driver is the rollout of the European Union&rsquo;s carbon border adjustment mechanism, externalising the bloc&rsquo;s carbon pricing. That may well catalyse similar measures elsewhere, including in the US, thereby creating wider markets for decarbonised commodities.Such expansion, however, will remain tied to government support to a greater degree than in other cleantech sectors better placed to outgrow subsidies. That&rsquo;s especially so because, unlike the stench and pests of festering sewage, carbon dioxide is odourless and its hazardous effects accrete over decades. Our desire to get rid of it is a regulatory construct rather than innate &mdash; hence the contentious politics. Therein lies the flaw of seeing CCS as insurance for fossil fuel demand. Having CCS break out of niche applications to become widespread would require societies to internalise the risks of climate change to such a degree that they are willing to incentivise even the most expensive forms of emissions abatement on a sustained basis. In that world, carbon pricing, either explicit or implicit, is robust, sustained and global &mdash; which would ultimately decimate demand for fossil fuels overall. CCS is a useful hedge against the energy transition&rsquo;s own limitations but not against that transition itself. ",

            "articleBody": "HOUSTON: Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday signaled that lower refining margins across the industry will reduce its profits from fuels in the second quarter. A snapshot of operating factors affecting the quarter suggests earnings per share between $1.50 and $2.40, which is 17% below market consensus. The preview excludes additional oil and gas production from its $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, concluded on May 3. The largest US oil producer indicated results from oil and gas - its main business - will increase to about $6.2 billion due to higher prices, from $4.6 billion in the second quarter last year, according to a securities filing. Full financial results are due on August 2. Exxon has more than doubled its production to 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) since concluding the acquisition of Pioneer, up from 620,000 boepd in 2023. The full effects of the merger will be felt in the third quarter. The company has said it plans to triple Permian production to 2 million boepd by 2027 by drilling more and closer horizontal wells in a cube format within Pioneer's inventory. Results also reflect record oil production from Guyana, where it pumped 632,000 boepd with partners in May, reaching a daily record of 663,000 boepd. This is about 100,000 boepd above the initial planned capacity. Exxon shares have risen more than 13% this year, below the S&amp;P 500's 16% increase, but ahead of other major Western oil rivals. The company has announced it will increase buybacks to a $20 billion run rate following the closure of the acquisition. It had projected a 40,000 boepd negative production impact in the quarter due to scheduled maintenance and $3 billion in seasonal cash tax payments. ",

He said the ongoing negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and India \"hold promise to enhance trade flows and economic cooperation significantly\". The Federation of European Business in India (FEBI), the official Chamber of EU businesses in India, supported by the EU Delegation in India and the embassies of the EU member states, has held its first Annual General Meeting, marking a significant milestone in its new journey, according to an official statement issued on Monday. The meeting formalised the Board of Directors with 14 elected members and confirmed key office bearers, it said. Remi Maillard, President and Managing Director of Airbus in India and South Asia, will lead FEBI as its first president, with Sanjay Tiwari, Public Affairs Advisor to Maersk India Pvt. Ltd. and Oscar Esteban, President, Indo-Spanish Chamber of Commerce, elected as vice-president and treasurer, the statement said. The inaugural AGM was held in New Delhi on July 4. \"EU-India relations have been on an ascending trajectory, with a growing economic footprint. Over 4,500 European companies are present in India, providing 6.5 million direct and indirect jobs,\" Delphin, Ambassador of the EU to India and Honorary President of FEBI, was quoted as saying in the statement. \"The EU is India's largest trading partner in goods, with trade amounting to EUR 123 billion in 2022-23, and ranks among the top three investors in India. Ongoing negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and India hold promise to enhance trade flows and economic cooperation significantly. \"FEBI will bring a very much needed business perspective that will contribute to the further expansion and bringing together of the EU-India economic and trade ecosystem. It will be a true force multiplier,\" he said. FEBI will maintain close and constructive relations with Indian and European authorities, acting as a \"credible intermediary\" between government and businesses and an \"advocacy place\" for pro-business policies and solutions, said the statement issued by the Delegation of the European Union to India and Bhutan. Currently, FEBI boasts a membership of 73 companies representing a diverse cross-section of EU member states across 10 sectors in India, including aerospace, automotive, agri-food products, chemicals and pharmaceutical, consumer and luxury goods, finance and insurance, telecom and ICT and digital trade, machinery and capital goods, energy and renewables, and transportation and logistics. More companies are in the process of joining FEBI, it said. FEBI's mission is to articulate the collective business interests of EU companies in India and facilitate the growth in trade and investment between the EU and India. \"It is as much an honour as a responsibility to helm FEBI as its inaugural president. FEBI will serve as a bridge between Europe and India to deepen bilateral trade and investment. India's rapid expansion holds significant potential for European companies to grow here in a symbiotic way,\" Maillard was quoted as saying in the statement. \"We will work with our Indian and EU stakeholders and industrial partners to ensure that trade opens more opportunities, thereby helping both regions to grow and thrive together,\" he said after his confirmation as president of FEBI.",

The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Regulatory Commission (CSERC) has hiked the power tariff by 8.35 per cent in all categories of consumers over the existing rate in the state. The new tariffs were made effective from June 1. Former chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and Congress's state unit chief Deepak Baij took part in the protests in Raipur. Other party leaders staged agitations in the district headquarters and development blocks, a party functionary here said. Congress leaders and workers marched holding lanterns at Rajiv Chowk here. Hitting out at the ruling BJP, Baghel said domestic consumers, farmers, industrialists and businessmen were bearing the brunt of increased electricity tariffs and power cuts. \"Coal is being supplied to half of the country from Chhattisgarh. The state that supplies energy (coal for power plants) to the rest of the country is itself facing interruptions in power supply,\" he told reporters. Baghel further claimed that the power tariff in Chhattisgarh was more than its neighbouring states. Talking to reporters, Baij said the previous Congress government had provided power at cheaper rates, but the BJP hiked the tariff soon after it came to power.",

            "articleBody": "Islamabad: Pakistan has decided to approach its all-weather ally China with a formal request to restructure its USD 15 billion energy debt to help the cash-strapped country wriggle out of its financial woes. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb would visit China this week, the Express Tribune newspaper quoted highly placed sources as saying. While Iqbal's visit was pre-planned, the finance minister is being sent as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's special messenger, they added. Iqbal is scheduled to attend the Global Development Initiative forum to be held in China from July 11 to 13. As the finance minister's visit was not scheduled earlier, Pakistan's ambassador to Beijing has been instructed to arrange meetings with Chinese authorities, said the sources. A Cabinet member, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the premier decided the issue of Chinese Independent Power Producers' (IPP) debt should be immediately taken up for \"re-profiling\". According to the sources, the finance minister will carry a letter from Prime Minister Sharif requesting debt restructuring. During the June 4-8 visit, Prime Minister Sharif requested President Xi Jinping to consider re-profiling the IPPs' debt and converting the imported-coal-fired power plants. Aurangzeb will seek approval for a mechanism to proceed, though Chinese authorities have repeatedly refused to restructure these deals. The delegation would also formally convey Pakistan's request to convert Chinese-imported coal-fired power plants to local coal. They said there is a proposal for the government to help Chinese investors arrange loans from local banks to convert these plants to indigenous coal. The sources added that Habib Bank Limited (HBL) is also engaged in the process. China has set up 21 energy projects in Pakistan with a total cost of USD 21 billion, including about USD 5 billion in equity. Chinese investors obtained loans for these projects at an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) plus 4.5 per cent. Against the remaining Chinese energy debt of over USD 15 billion, payments by 2040 would total USD 16.6 billion, according to government sources. The proposal involves extending debt repayments from 10 to 15 years. This would reduce the outflow of foreign currency by about USD 550 million to USD 750 million per annum and decrease prices by Rs 3 per unit. According to the existing IPP deals, the current power tariff structure requires debt servicing repayments during the first 10 years, leading to a significant burden on consumers who are paying the interest and principal of these loans through higher tariffs. However, due to the extended repayment period, the country will also have to make an extra USD 1.3 billion payment to China, sources said. The Cabinet member stated that Pakistan needs immediate fiscal space and some room for reducing prices, although the overall cost would increase in the long run. The government's economic challenges have multiplied, and it has not yet been able to conclude the International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal or lower electricity prices. To secure the IMF deal, the government imposed a record Rs 1.7 trillion in additional taxes on Pakistan's lower, middle, and upper-middle-income groups. Electricity prices were also approved to increase by 14 per cent to 51 per cent to collect another Rs 580 billion from residential and commercial consumers. However, the Ministry of Finance has not been able to give a firm date for the staff-level agreement with the IMF. Finance Minister Aurangzeb, a former banker, hopes the deal may be reached this month. Despite raising average base tariffs by around Rs 18 per unit over the past two years, the Power Division told the prime minister on Saturday that as of end-May, the circular debt owed to power companies had again increased to Rs 2.65 trillion-Rs 345 billion higher than the level agreed with the IMF. The government has neither been able to give a firm date for the IMF staff-level deal nor reduce the cost of electricity and the circular debt. Pakistani sources indicated that China might not grant further concessions in debt until resolving their over Rs 500 billion outstanding dues and ensuring security for Chinese nationals in Pakistan. IMF bailout packages have hindered Chinese energy deals due to restrictions on repayments. If China agrees to debt restructuring, the repayment period will be extended to 2040, including interest payments. According to Pakistani authorities, repayment would be USD 600 million less this year and can be reduced to just USD 1.63 billion after restructuring. For 2025, debt repayments would decrease from USD 2.1 billion to USD 1.55 billion - a benefit of USD 580 million, sources said. However, the upfront relief would result in more repayments from 2036 to 2040. In April, Prime Minister Sharif ordered all imported coal-fired power plants, including three Chinese plants, to convert to local coal to save USD 800 million annually and reduce consumer rates by Rs 3 per unit. The finance and planning ministers will request Chinese approval for this project and propose financing with HBL.",

It added that the company&rsquo;s Telangana facility has also been granted provisional enlistment for four models. Other firms included in the list were Maharashtra-based Spark Solar Technologies and West Bengal-based Sova Solar, which received provisional approval for two models. Gujarat&rsquo;s Aatmanirbhar Solar was provisionally enlisted for seven models while Uttar Pradesh-headquartered Jakson Engineers was granted enlistment for eight module models. Gujarat-based Goldi Sun was granted provisional enlistment for eight module models. The document, however, noted that the final enlistment of the companies was subject to the companies fulfilling the conditions mentioned in the ALMM Order and Guidelines, and after passing government scrutiny.It further highlighted that neither the ministry and National Institute of Solar Energy would be liable for any liability arising out of the solar module models which have been granted provisional enlistment in MNRE's ALMM List-I, but fail to get final enlistment in the list.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Weak refining margins and lower oil trading results will dent BP's second-quarter profit by up to $700 million, the company said on Tuesday, sending its shares down by over 3%. The warning, which led several analysts to lower their earnings estimates, will weigh on CEO Murray Auchincloss' efforts to rebuild investor confidence in BP's strategy. US oil major Exxon Mobil on Monday also signalled that lower refining margins and natural gas prices would reduce its second-quarter profit. The London-listed company said refining margins will be significantly lower in the quarter due to weak diesel prices and narrower North American heavy crude oil differentials that impact its large refinery in Whiting, Indiana. As a result, earnings in the second quarter will be between $500 million and $700 million lower than for the previous three months. A high level of refinery maintenance compared with the first quarter will be offset in part as the Whiting refinery resumes operations in the quarter, resulting in an earnings uplift of around $500 million, BP said. BP also expects to record $1 billion to $2 billion in charges in the second quarter, mainly tied to its review of Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany. BP shares were down 3.8% at 1008 GMT, compared with a small gain in rival Shell's shares. Citi analysts lowered their Q2 earnings per share estimate by 9% while Jefferies analysts expected the update to result in a 20% earnings downgrade. Investors expect BP's second-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company's definition of net income, to come in at $3.13 billion, according to LSEG data. Reuters reported earlier this year that BP had imposed a hiring freeze and paused renewables projects as part of Auchincloss' plan to boost returns and cut costs by $2 billion. \"Alongside any major strategic shifts, BP needs to demonstrate competence in the day-to-day running of the business and today's update doesn't help in that sense,\" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said in a note. BP, which is set to post its quarterly results on July 30, said its upstream production in the second quarter is expected to be broadly flat compared with the prior three months. Oil and gas production stood at 2.38 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the first quarter, following field start-ups in Azerbaijan and the United States. Higher realised oil prices in the second quarter will boost profits by $100 to $300 million, BP said. Last week, Shell had said it would take an impairment charge of up to $2 billion relating to the sale of its Singapore refinery and the pause of construction at one of Europe's largest biofuel plants in the Netherlands.

            "articleBody": "The United States will fall far short of the Biden administration's 2030 offshore wind goal but will catch up quickly in the following years, according to an analysis by an industry group published on Tuesday. The American Clean Power Association (ACP) projected there will be about 14 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity along U.S. coastlines by 2030. That compares with a goal of 30 GW that President Joe Biden's administration laid out in 2021 as it sought to jumpstart the domestic energy industry. Offshore wind is a key pillar of Biden's promise that fighting climate change will create jobs and invigorate the economy. But soaring materials costs, high interest rates and supply chain snags have led multiple offshore wind companies in the last year to cancel or seek to renegotiate power contracts for planned U.S. offshore wind farms. Those challenges have cast doubt on the industry's ability to meet the administration's timeline. There are just 174 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind capacity currently installed in the U.S. as of June 30, though that more than quadrupled from 42 MW a year ago, according to the ACP. The industry has more than 12 GW in advanced development or under construction, the report said. The U.S. is far behind market leader China, which has nearly 38 GW of offshore wind capacity. The United States will reach the 30 GW target by 2033 and nearly 40 GW by 2035, the ACP said in its offshore wind market report. The industry is on track to invest $65 billion in projects by 2030 and create 56,000 jobs, the ACP added. (Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

Temasek on Tuesday reported an SGD 7 billion rise in its Net Portfolio Value (NPV) to SGD 389 billion for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, mainly driven by gains to the US and India investments.  India has continued to see strong economic momentum alongside improving macro and political stability, the company said in a statement.  \"We expect growth to remain firm over the next two years, primarily driven by infrastructure-led capital expenditure, accelerated supply chain diversification, and a recovery in private consumption,\" Temasek said.  Temasek said its Net Portfolio Value (NPV) rose by SGD 7 billion to SGD 389 billion for the financial year ended March 31, 2024.  \"The increase was mainly due to our investment returns from the US and India, offset by the underperformance of China's capital markets,\" it said.  Temasek said it maintained a cautious but steady investment pace amidst global economic uncertainties, and invested SGD 26 billion into opportunities in sectors such as technology, financial services, sustainability, consumer, and healthcare, aligned with the four structural trends of digitisation, sustainable living, future of consumption, and longer lifespans.  Excluding Singapore, the US continued to be the leading destination for Temasek capital, followed by India and Europe while it has also stepped-up investment activities in Japan.  Temasek divested SGD 33 billion for the year. Of this, about SGD 10 billion was due to the redemption of capital by Singapore Airlines and Pavilion Energy for their mandatory convertible bonds and preferential shares respectively.  Overall, Temasek had a net divestment of SGD 7 billion, compared to a net investment of SGD 4 billion a year ago.  \"We invested in Electric Vehicle companies Mahindra Electric Automobile in India and BYD in China, sustainable battery solutions provider Ascend Elements in the US, and electrolyser manufacturer Electric Hydrogen in the US,\" it added.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will invest about Rs 2 lakh crore in setting up renewable energy sites and green hydrogen plants and cutting gas flaring to zero to achieve its 2038 net-zero carbon emission goal. The company, which produces about two-thirds of India's crude oil and about 58 per cent of natural gas, on Tuesday released a 200-page document, detailing its path to achieving net zero emissions. It listed clean energy projects even as it looks to boost its hydrocarbon output to meet the country's energy needs. ONGC will invest Rs 97,000 crore by 2030 in setting up 5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, green hydrogen, biogas, pump storage plant and offshore wind project, according to the document. Another Rs 65,500 crore will be invested by 2035, mostly in a green hydrogen or green ammonia plant, and the remaining Rs 38,000 crore by 2038, primarily in setting up 1 GW of offshore wind projects. These projects will help the firm offset 9 million tonnes of carbon emissions it is directly (Scope-1 emissions) or indirectly (Scope-2 emissions) responsible for. ONGC said it will invest Rs 5,000 crore to cut gas flaring to zero by 2030 through technological intervention. The firm released into the atmosphere 554 million cubic metres of methane in 2021-22 (base year), mostly because it was an incidental by-product of oil or the quantity was not economical enough to pipe it to consumers. ONGC will spend Rs 30,000 crore in setting up 5 GW solar parks that will convert sunlight into electricity and turbines that will do the same with wind energy. It will add 1 GW of solar and onshore wind capacity by 2035 and 2038 at a cost of Rs 5,000 crore each. It will invest Rs 40,000 crore by 2030 and a similar amount by 2035 to set up two 1,80,000 tonnes per annum green hydrogen and/or 1 million tonnes of green ammonia projects. ONGC, which has installations in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal to produce oil and gas from below the seabed, is also looking at installing offshore wind turbines to generate 0.5 GW of electricity by 2030 and double it by 2035. The first 0.5 GW offshore wind project is likely to cost Rs 12,500 crore and the next about Rs 12,000 crore. By 2038, it will add another 1 GW of offshore wind energy capacity at an investment of Rs 25,000 crore, the document said. The company is also looking at investing Rs 20,000 crore for setting up 3 GW of pump storage plants to meet electricity requirements when renewable sources like sunlight and wind energy are not available. The remaining investment will be in biogas, carbon capture and other clean energy projects. All this while it continues to hunt and produce more oil and gas. Crude oil, which companies like ONGC pump out from below the seabed and from underground reservoirs, is a primary source of energy. It is processed in oil refineries to produce petrol, diesel and jet fuel. With the world looking to transition away from fossil fuels, companies around the globe are looking at new avenues to use crude oil. Gas produced in a similar fashion is used to generate electricity, produce fertiliser or convert into CNG to power automobiles or into PNG to fire kitchen stoves. Scope 1 emissions are from directly emitting sources that are owned or controlled by a company. Scope 2 emissions are from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from a company's direct operations. ONGC produced 21.14 million tonnes of oil in 2023-24 (April 2023 to March 2024) and 20.648 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas.",

            "articleBody": "VIENNA: Austria's energy minister has appointed a commission of experts to examine whether Austria can scrap a gas-supply contract between OMV and Gazprom to reduce its dependence on Russia, she said on Tuesday. Leonore Gewessler of the Greens, which is the junior partner in a conservative-led coalition, said in February she wanted to end the contract that runs until 2040. Chancellor Karl Nehammer's conservatives have said they agree Austria needs to move away from Russian gas. Ahead of a parliamentary election due on Sept. 29, however, the two sides of the coalition increasingly have been at odds. In May, the latest month for which data is available, 90% of net gas imports came from Russia. Gewessler said OMV had agreed to grant members of the commission access to the contract, the terms of which are a closely-guarded secret. Her commission, made up of economists and legal specialists, is headed by retired judge and former lawmaker for the liberal Neos Irmgard Griss and law professor Andreas Kletecka. \"It is a very significant and important question: isn't there a way to get out of this contract?\" Griss told a news conference. \"Is there anything you can use legally to get out of this contract?\" The commission's initial findings are due to be presented \"by autumn\" before a final report by the end of this year, Gewessler's ministry said in a statement without specifying whether that could be before the September elections. The far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which rival parties accuse of being dangerously pro-Russian, has led opinion polls. It says it is merely defending Austria's neutrality. ",

I have never seen such destruction of the state in my political career, even though this is my fourth term. We are committed to development and are handling these burdens. We will come up with strategies to resolve all these issues. We are committed to providing uninterrupted electricity supply,\" the chief minister said, releasing the whitepaper.\"We are committed to providing uninterrupted electricity supply. The quality of electricity should be maintained without hiking true-up charges. I have to go through the agreements done by the previous government. Andhra Pradesh is one of the states to go with green hydrogen,\" the CM added.Further, the paper also alleged that investors lost confidence and the brand image of Andhra Pradesh was spoiled.The average tariff for domestic consumers increased from Rs. 3.87 per unit to Rs 5.63 per unit*, a rise of 45 per cent, during the Reddy government, the whitepaper noted.\"Poor consumers impacted with higher tariff increase of 78- 98 per cent compared to up to 29 per cent for middle-class consumers. Overall, 153 Lakh customers impacted,\" the whitepaper read.It also noted that a delay in the commissioning of thermal power plants resulted in a total additional burden of Rs 12,818 crore.It particularly mentioned the delay in the commissioning of the Polavaram Hydro Electric Project. A contract was awarded on December 6, 2017, with an expected commissioning date of May 2023.Later, according to the whitepaper, the contract was terminated and the commissioning date was revised to January 2026.Due to ongoing arbitration, the whitepaper asserted that it led to the expected loss of up to Rs 1,500 crore. The impact of price variation was Rs 350 crore.Delay in the commissioning of Polavaram Hydro Electric Project is expected to result in total additional burden of Rs 4,737 crore.In the way forward, it suggested that there was a need to address the legacy losses of Rs 129,503 crore, there is a need to bring back the investors' confidence and rebuild the brand Andhra Pradesh, ensure there are no power cuts, provide quality and reliable power supply at affordable rates.\"We have introduced Power Sector Reforms 1.0, Power Sector Reforms 2.0 and now we need Power Sector Reforms 3.0 to transform the sector for empowering the society. Hence seeking inputs and support from all stakeholders to strengthen my hands and make AP as Energy Hub of the future,\" the whitepaper read.",

            "articleBody": "India plans to spend $1 billion to expedite the construction of 12 hydropower stations in the northeastern Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh, two government sources said, a move that could raise tensions with China that lays claims to the region. The federal finance ministry under Nirmala Sitharaman recently approved up to 7.5 billion rupees ($89.85 million) in financial assistance to each hydropower project in the northeastern region, the sources said.  Under the scheme, about 90 billion rupees will likely be allotted for the 12 hydropower projects in Arunachal Pradesh, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter. The scheme is likely to support northeastern states and help them finance equity holdings in the projects they host. Having state governments on board generally helps in expediting regulatory clearances, locals rehabilitation and negotiations on sharing electricity with the host state.  The plans for the hydropower stations are expected to be announced in the 2024/2025 federal budget that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government will unveil on July 23, the sources said, declining to be named as the information remained confidential.  The Indian finance and power ministries and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.  Last August, the government awarded contracts to state-run firms NHPC, SJVNL and NEEPCO for the construction of the 11.5-gigawatt-capacity plants entailing an estimated investment of $11 billion, as part of a broader project to develop infrastructure in the border region.  None of the companies responded to a request for comments.  These power plants were earlier enlisted with private sector firms, but remained non-starters due to various reasons.  India has built less than 15-gigawatt hydropower plants in the last 20 years, while installations of new coal and other renewable sources of energy were nearly 10 times of the new hydropower projects.  India and China share a 2,500 km (1553.43 mile) largely un-demarcated border, over which they fought a war in 1962.  India says Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country, but China claims it is a part of southern Tibet, and has objected to other Indian infrastructure projects there. The Indian government is pushing projects in the eastern region following reports that Beijing could construct dams on a section of the Brahmaputra river, known as the Yarlung Tsangbo in China, that flows from Tibet through Arunachal Pradesh.  India is concerned that Chinese projects in the region could trigger flash floods or create water scarcity.  Both countries are working to improve infrastructure along their border regions since clashes in western Himalayas left 20 Indian and at least four Chinese troops dead in 2020. Last week, India Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Kazakhstan where the two agreed to step up talks to resolve issues along their border.",

Significant numbers of biometric Aadhaar authentications (more than 35 lakh PMUY beneficiaries) were successfully conducted during Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra camps. Authentication activities are being undertaken as a part of LPG safety inspections/ camps which are currently undergoing. To further augment the authentication of consumers, MoPNG in October 2023 had issued directions to oil marketing companies (OMCs) to undertake and complete biometric Aadhaar authentication of PMUY and PAHAL beneficiaries, the ministry said.OMCs have been diligently implementing biometric Aadhaar authentication processes for LPG customers. More than 55 per cent of PMUY beneficiaries have already completed their biometric Aadhaar authentication. It is also clarified that no service or benefit has been stopped for consumers whose biometric authentication has not been completed.Domestic LPG consumers can complete the biometric Aadhaar authentication using any of the following channels:During LPG cylinder deliveries, the LPG delivery personnel can be asked to conduct biometric Aadhaar authentication.Customers have the option to visit their LPG distributor showrooms at their convenience for authentication.OMCs provide mobile applications that enable customers to complete the authentication process independently.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Chairman RC Bhargava on Tuesday said the reported 100 per cent registration waiver for hybrid vehicles by the Uttar Pradesh government recognises the fact that multiple technologies are required to reduce carbon emissions and oil imports. According to reports, the Uttar Pradesh government has announced a 100 per cent registration tax waiver on hybrid vehicles leading to a drop in prices of models by up to Rs 3.5 lakh. When contacted, Bhargava told PTI that the step taken by the UP government would also inspire other states to consider such proposals. \"The UP government action is the first instance where a state government has realised and acted on the fact that multiple technologies are required for reduction in carbon emissions and oil imports,\" he stated. Electric cars are not the only option, there are other effective technologies like hybrid cars to tackle the issue, Bhargava asserted. On Tuesday, Maruti Suzuki shares jumped 6.6 per cent to settle at Rs 12,820.20 on the BSE. During the day, it soared 7.72 per cent to Rs 12,955. At the NSE, it climbed 6.51 per cent to Rs 12,807. Maruti was the biggest gainer in the Sensex and Nifty pack. Hybrid vehicles are powered by an internal combustion engine and one or more electric motors, which use energy stored in batteries. Toyota Kirloskar sells Innova Hycross and Urban Cruiser Hyryder with strong hybrid technology while Maruti Suzuki also sells some trims of the Invicto and Grand Vitara with strong hybrid mechanisms.  Honda also sells some variants of its mid-sized sedan City with self-charging hybrid technology.  Currently, the total tax incidence on hybrid vehicles in the country is 43 per cent, which is inclusive of GST, while battery electric vehicles attract a tax of about 5 per cent.",

During the session, highlighted the significance of collective efforts towards a more promising &amp; sustainable future along with advancing the growth of the power sector in the North-Eastern region,\" Khattar wrote in a post on X. Later, talking to reporters, the minister said he held two review meetings with power ministers and urban affairs ministers of the region here. \"We reviewed all projects of both the ministries, and discussed the challenges and demands. We have been able to get new inputs from the states,\" he said. Khattar said time extension has been given for completion of some projects, and all of those will be complete by March 2025. He also underlined the potential of the northeast states to contribute to the development of the country, especially in sectors such as power and tourism. Asked about the possibility of metro rail service in the region, he said it depends on urbanisation as well as financial feasibility. On the flood situation in Assam, Khattar said he had discussed the issue with the chief minister and central government officials, indicating that an assistance package could be declared soon. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, in a post on X, said: \"I had an extremely fruitful discussion with Hon'ble Union Minister Shri @mlkhattar ji during his first visit to Assam after assuming charge.\" He said the state has sought \"assistance to help rationalise gas prices to meet Assam's increased demand for power. The state's peak power demand has already crossed over 2500 MW.\" \"Shared our plans to achieve saturation in urban drinking water supply, building the Guwahati River Front and develop a new satellite township on G20 principles near Guwahati. We also deliberated on the possibility of establishing a Centre of Excellence for Urban Planning in the State,\" Sarma said. In another post on X, the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said that Sarma also apprised the Union minister of the state's initiatives to revamp the power sector and urban infrastructure.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India wants to strengthen its energy ties with Russia and could seek deals with Rosneft and other leading Russian oil firms as part of a broader push to boost bilateral trade, Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra said on Tuesday. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin have set a target of increasing bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030 from about $65 billion at present, Kwatra told a news conference after the two leaders met in Moscow. \"The two leaders when they spoke of cooperation in the (energy) sector, they did focus on how exactly to strengthen that partnership,\" Kwatra said. \"(And) in the similar vein, how exactly India in particular through the government-to-government route could also build partnerships with Rosneft and other energy entities,\" he added.  India has emerged as the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne oil sold at a discount as Western entities shun purchases due to a raft of sanctions imposed on Russian over its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Russia is the top oil supplier to India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer. After Putin and Modi's meeting, the two countries in a joint statement outlined nine key areas of cooperation for the $100-billion trade target. India is keen to boost its exports to Russia to fix its trade balance, tilted in favour of Moscow. The two nations want the elimination of non-tariff trade barriers and will continue to work for a Free Trade Agreement between Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union and India, the joint statement said. Energy cooperation included areas such as nuclear energy, oil refining and petrochemicals, partnership in energy infrastructure, technologies and equipment. Russian entities including Roneft have a majority stake in private refiner Nayara Energy, while Indian companies hold stakes in Russian oil exploration and production projects in the far east. India's ONGC Videsh is seeking a formal approval from the Russian authorities to retain its stake of 20% in the Sakhalin 1 oil project in Russia. Beyond energy, Kwatra said India is a key buyer of Russian fertilisers and want to \"consolidate and build\" its relations with Moscow for security of crop nutrients. Modi and Putin also agreed to develop a bilateral settlement system using national currencies, the statement said.",

            "articleBody": "State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will invest about Rs 2 lakh crore in setting up renewable energy sites and green hydrogen plants and cutting gas flaring to zero to achieve its 2038 net-zero carbon emission goal. The company, which produces about two-thirds of India's crude oil and about 58 per cent of natural gas, on Tuesday released a 200-page document, detailing its path to achieving net zero emissions. It listed clean energy projects even as it looks to boost its hydrocarbon output to meet the country's energy needs. ONGC will invest Rs 97,000 crore by 2030 in setting up 5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, green hydrogen, biogas, pump storage plant and offshore wind project, according to the document. Another Rs 65,500 crore will be invested by 2035, mostly in a green hydrogen or green ammonia plant, and the remaining Rs 38,000 crore by 2038, primarily in setting up 1 GW of offshore wind projects. These projects will help the firm offset 9 million tonnes of carbon emissions it is directly (Scope-1 emissions) or indirectly (Scope-2 emissions) responsible for. ONGC said it will invest Rs 5,000 crore to cut gas flaring to zero by 2030 through technological intervention. The firm released into the atmosphere 554 million cubic metres of methane in 2021-22 (base year), mostly because it was an incidental by-product of oil or the quantity was not economical enough to pipe it to consumers. ONGC will spend Rs 30,000 crore in setting up 5 GW solar parks that will convert sunlight into electricity and turbines that will do the same with wind energy. It will add 1 GW of solar and onshore wind capacity by 2035 and 2038 at a cost of Rs 5,000 crore each. It will invest Rs 40,000 crore by 2030 and a similar amount by 2035 to set up two 1,80,000 tonnes per annum green hydrogen and/or 1 million tonnes of green ammonia projects. ONGC, which has installations in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal to produce oil and gas from below the seabed, is also looking at installing offshore wind turbines to generate 0.5 GW of electricity by 2030 and double it by 2035. The first 0.5 GW offshore wind project is likely to cost Rs 12,500 crore and the next about Rs 12,000 crore. By 2038, it will add another 1 GW of offshore wind energy capacity at an investment of Rs 25,000 crore, the document said. The company is also looking at investing Rs 20,000 crore for setting up 3 GW of pump storage plants to meet electricity requirements when renewable sources like sunlight and wind energy are not available. The remaining investment will be in biogas, carbon capture and other clean energy projects. All this while it continues to hunt and produce more oil and gas. Crude oil, which companies like ONGC pump out from below the seabed and from underground reservoirs, is a primary source of energy. It is processed in oil refineries to produce petrol, diesel and jet fuel. With the world looking to transition away from fossil fuels, companies around the globe are looking at new avenues to use crude oil. Gas produced in a similar fashion is used to generate electricity, produce fertiliser or convert into CNG to power automobiles or into PNG to fire kitchen stoves. Scope 1 emissions are from directly emitting sources that are owned or controlled by a company. Scope 2 emissions are from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from a company's direct operations. ONGC produced 21.14 million tonnes of oil in 2023-24 (April 2023 to March 2024) and 20.648 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India and Russia on Wednesday agreed to boost bilateral trade to over USD 100 billion by 2030 by reinvigorating investments, using national currencies for trade and increasing cooperations in sectors ranging from energy to agriculture and infrastructure. In the joint statement issued following the 22nd Annual Bilateral Summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow, the two sides reiterated commitment to development of the special and privileged strategic partnership and vowed to give additional impetus to the deepening of bilateral interaction by promoting Russia-India trade and economic cooperation.  The two sides agreed on nine key areas of cooperations that spanned trade, trade settlement using national currencies, increased cargo turnover through new routes such as the North-South Transport Corridor, raising volume of trade in agri products, food and fertiliser, deepening cooperation in the energy sector, including nuclear energy, strengthening interaction for infrastructure development, promotion of investments and joint projects across digital economy, collaborating on supply of medicines and development of humanitarian cooperation.  The leaders agreed to aspire \"for elimination of non-tariff trade barriers related to bilateral trade between India and Russia\" and continue \"dialogue in the field of liberalisation of bilateral trade, including the possibility of the establishment of the EAEU-India Free Trade Area\".  This to achieve mutually agreed trade volume of more than USD 100 billion by 2030, including increased supplies of goods from India to achieve balanced bilateral trade. Also, reinvigoration of investment activities within the framework of the special investment regimes was agreed.  They agreed on \"development of a bilateral settlement system using national currencies\", the joint statement said.  This means any purchase by India from Russia such as crude oil, can potentially be paid in Indian rupee.  This currency can then be used by Russia to settle payments for imports from India. A vice-versa use of Russian rubles is also possible.  The two leaders agreed for \"increase of cargo turnover with India through the launch of new routes of the North-South International Transport Corridor, the Northern Sea Route and the Chennai-Vladivostok Sea Line,\" it said, adding that optimisation of customs procedures through the application of intelligent digital systems for barrier-free movement of goods was also agreed.  They were for raising the volume of bilateral trade in agricultural products, food and fertilisers as well as maintenance of an intensive dialogue aimed at removing veterinary, sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions and prohibitions.  \"Development of cooperation in key energy sectors, including nuclear energy, oil refining and petrochemicals and expanded forms of cooperation and partnership in the field of energy infrastructure, technologies and equipment\" too was part of the agreement, it said.  \"Facilitation of mutual and international energy security, i.e. taking into account the prospects of global energy transition\" was also agreed upon.  The two sides agreed to strengthen interaction in the fields of infrastructure development, transport engineering, automobile production and shipbuilding, space and other industrial sectors.  Facilitation of entry of Indian and Russian companies in each other's markets by creating subsidiaries and industrial clusters, too, was agreed upon.  \"Promotion of investments and joint projects across various sectors of digital economy, science and research, educational exchanges and internships for employees of high-tech companies\" also found a mention in the joint statement.  They also agreed for facilitation of the creation of new joint (subsidiary) companies by providing them with favourable fiscal regimes.  Promotion of systematic cooperation in the development and supply of medicines and advanced medical equipment as well as studying the possibility of opening branches of Indian medical institutions in Russia and recruiting qualified medical personnel as well as strengthening of coordination in the field of medical and biological safety was also agreed upon.  The two sides were in favour of developing humanitarian cooperation, consistent expansion of interaction in the fields of education, science and technology, culture, tourism, sports, healthcare and other areas.  \"The President of the Russian Federation and the Prime Minister of the Republic of India instructed the Russian-Indian Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation to study the identified priority areas and to assess the progress at its next meeting,\" it added.",

The Panchayati Raj Ministry has written to states to share guidelines of the ambitious scheme launched in February 2024 to install rooftop solar panels and provide free electricity up to 300 monthly units for one crore households.  In a letter dated July 8 to all state departments, Additional Secretary of the Panchayati Raj Ministry Chandra Shekhar Kumar asked officials to share the operational guidelines of the scheme with the Panchayati Raj Institutions, officers of State Panchayati Raj Departments and other stakeholders for greater understanding.  He also called for taking \"necessary actions to actively involve in the successful implementation of the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana\".  The Additional Secretary said the scheme would also incentivise Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to promote rooftop solar installations in the rural community and contribute to adopting clean energy in rural areas and create a new Source of Revenue for PRIs.  The Centre approved the scheme to increase the share of solar rooftop capacity and empower residential households to generate their own electricity.  The scheme has an outlay of Rs 75,021 crore and is to be implemented till FY 2026-27.  It provides a central financial assistance (CFA) of 60 per cent of system cost for 2 kW systems and 40 per cent of additional system cost for systems between 2 kW to 3 kW capacity. The CFA will be capped at 3 kW.  The scheme has a Rs. 800 crore budget to develop a \"model village\" in each district for the adoption of rooftop solar in rural areas and a Rs 1000 crore outlay for incentivising local bodies to promote rooftop solar (RTS) installations in their areas.  At current benchmark prices, this will mean Rs 30,000 subsidy for 1 kW system, Rs 60,000 for 2 kW systems and Rs 78,000 for 3 kW systems or higher.  The guidelines also provide an option for giving up the subsidy, which can be availed through the PM Surya Ghar National Portal.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In the upcoming Union Budget for fiscal year 2024-25, set to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23, the power sector may see pivotal changes, including the potential inclusion under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) has put forward a series of proposals aimed at reducing costs and fostering growth within the sector.Currently, the power sector is not covered under GST, which was implemented on July 1, 2017. This exemption has led to an increased tariff burden due to the cascading effect of indirect taxes. NSEFI's proposal for GST inclusion seeks to streamline taxations and lower the cost for consumers and businesses alike.Further recommendations by NSEFI include maintaining the exemption from basic customs duty on imports of key renewable energy components such as wafer, ingots, and polysilicon. This move is intended to bolster the domestic manufacturing of renewable energy infrastructure.Another significant aspect of NSEFI&rsquo;s proposals is the removal of electricity duty (ED) and cross-subsidy surcharge (CSS) on power used in charging Energy Storage Systems (ESS). This measure is expected to encourage the use of energy storage technologies, critical for balancing the intermittency of renewable energy sources.Additionally, the federation has urged the government to introduce Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for Pumped Storage Projects (PSP), similar to the existing support for Battery Energy Storage Systems. This would promote the development of sustainable energy storage solutions, crucial for enhancing India's energy security and integration of renewable resources.NSEFI also seeks support for 100 agrivoltaic pilot projects across India, aiming to synergize solar power generation with agriculture, thus benefiting farmers and aiding the nation in meeting its renewable energy targets.These proposed reforms, if accepted, could significantly impact India's energy landscape, encouraging investments and technological advancements in the renewable energy sector as the country pushes towards its 2030 energy goals.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a strategic initiative aimed at environmental sustainability, the ministry of coal (MoC) has allocated a total of 19 coal mine voids to 13 thermal power plants (TPPs) for the disposal of fly ash. This move is part of the ministry's broader effort to mitigate the environmental impact of coal combustion and promote the reuse of fly ash in various applications.A Central level Working Group (CLWG) under the chairmanship of the additional secretary, ministry of coal, was established in 2023 to oversee this process. Thermal power plants interested in utilizing mine voids for fly ash disposal submit their applications to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), which are then reviewed in the CLWG meetings. This systematic allocation is designed to address the environmental concerns associated with fly ash, while also advancing sustainable practices within the coal mining sector.To date, approximately 20.39 lakh tonne of fly ash have been successfully repurposed at Gorbicoal mine pit-1, demonstrating the practical benefits of this initiative. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in its notification dated November 3, 2009, defines \"fly ash\" to include various forms such as Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) ash, dry fly ash, bottom ash, pond ash, and mound ash. Due to its composition rich in silicon dioxide (SiO2), calcium oxide (CaO), and aluminum oxide (Al2O3), fly ash is increasingly valued for its potential in construction and other industrial applications.The ministry of coal, in collaboration with the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), is also developing a centralized portal to streamline the application process for the allocation of mine voids. This portal is expected to enhance transparency and efficiency in managing fly ash backfilling activities.Furthering its commitment to sustainable mining practices, the ministry is conducting comprehensive feasibility studies to determine the optimal methods for mixing fly ash with overburden in operational mines. These studies, conducted in collaboration with the Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), include significant research at the Nigahi operational mine to establish the best percentage of fly ash to be mixed with overburden. Results from these studies are anticipated soon.Through these initiatives, the ministry of coal is ensuring the safe handling and management of fly ash, mitigating potential environmental risks associated with heavy metal leaching and fine particle emissions. By fostering collaboration with power plants, industries, and regulatory bodies, the Ministry aims to achieve optimal fly ash management, paving the way for a cleaner environment and a more sustainable approach to energy generation in India.",
