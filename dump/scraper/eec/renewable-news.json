This will be the first time in India that such a tender would be floated on this scale, Gupta told reporters on the sidelines of India Energy Storage Week 2024, organised by India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) on Wednesday.  \"The tender is expected to be out by the end of this financial year 2024-25. There have been (solar thermal) tenders but not of this scale,\" Gupta said in reply to a question on new solar thermal tenders.  The earlier tenders were small in size and their costs were also too high, he said.  The projects under the 500 MW tender will have advanced technology where steam would be generated through heat and it would also help in running turbines, he added.  Besides, the prices will be at par with other Round the Clock (RTC) solutions, Gupta said without elaborating further.  Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) is a nodal agency of the central government for auctioning renewable energy projects. RTC projects include solar wind capacity with battery storage.",

            "articleBody": "It was one of the most impactful short-seller reports ever: Hindenburg Research&rsquo;s 2023 broadside against the Adani Group erased as much as $153 billion of market value.But it turns out the US short-seller&rsquo;s gains from the saga were tiny by comparison &mdash; just over $4 million.That figure, which hasn&rsquo;t been independently confirmed by Bloomberg News, was disclosed by Hindenburg in a statement on its website Monday. It&rsquo;s the first time the New York-based firm, founded by Nathan Anderson, has provided a tally of its winnings from last year&rsquo;s bombshell report alleging fraud and market manipulation at the Indian business empire of Gautam Adani &mdash; one of Asia&rsquo;s richest tycoons.The contrast between Hindenburg&rsquo;s gains and the wider impact underscores how opportune research can have far-reaching effects, even if it&rsquo;s not always easy to profit from the fallout. Shares and bonds of Adani Group companies swung wildly in the immediate aftermath of Hindenburg&rsquo;s report but have since recovered ground. As of Monday, the group market value was $205 billion &mdash; about $30 billion short of its pre-Hindenburg level.The scathing report earned a gross revenue of about $4.1 million through gains related to Adani shorts from &ldquo;one investor relationship&rdquo; &mdash; Hindenburg didn&rsquo;t name who &mdash; and about &ldquo;$31,000 through our own short of Adani U.S. bonds,&rdquo; according to the short seller&rsquo;s July 1 statement.Hindenburg also called out India&rsquo;s markets regulator for failing to address the fraud allegations in its report last year.Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, &ldquo;seems more interested in pursuing those who expose such practices&rdquo; while its investigation into billionaire Adani&rsquo;s empire has hit a wall, Hindenburg said. Its latest broadside comes at a time when India&rsquo;s newly energized opposition parties have been criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for crony capitalism, after the leader was returned to power with a smaller mandate than expected last month. The firm also posted on its website the full &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; notice it said it received from Sebi in June, which states that Hindenburg&rsquo;s report on the Adani Group had certain misrepresentations and inaccurate statements that were meant to mislead readers. In the 46-page document, Sebi said Hindenburg &ldquo;has resorted to extrapolation and conjecture to emphasize some facts and understate others in favor of negative inference against Adani Group Companies.&rdquo; It also said the short seller cited a broker banned from the securities market, shaking investors&rsquo; trust in the regulatory framework.Adani Group stocks shrugged off the latest missive from Hindenburg. Shares of all 10 Adani-linked firms traded higher on Tuesday, led by the energy and gas units that rallied more than 4% each.&lsquo;Masking Kotak&rsquo;Hindenburg said that Sebi&rsquo;s notice &ldquo;conspicuously&rdquo; failed to mention Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, which it said created and oversaw the offshore fund structure used by Hindenburg&rsquo;s investor partner to bet against Adani. The regulator &ldquo;masked the &lsquo;Kotak&rsquo; name with the acronym &ldquo;KMIL&rdquo;,&rdquo; it added, though Kotak is the body with ties to India. KMIL refers to Kotak Mahindra Investments Ltd, the asset management company. Kotak Mahindra Bank&rsquo;s shares slipped as much as 3% on Tuesday after Hindenburg&rsquo;s disclosures. Kotak said in a statement on Tuesday that Hindenburg has never been a client of Kotak Mahindra International Ltd.Sebi&rsquo;s notice also named US hedge fund Kingdon Capital Management as an involved party, stating that Kingdon knew about Hindenburg&rsquo;s research on the Adani Group before it was published and had a profit-sharing pact with the short-seller on its trades. Hindenburg shared a draft of the Adani report with Kingdon in November 2022, nearly two months before it published the report, according to the Sebi show cause notice. In return Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg. That profit-sharing then got reduced to 25%, due to the cost of setting up these trades.In January the following year, a fund controlled by Mark Kingdon transferred $43 million to the K India Opportunities Fund, which started building short positions via futures for Adani Enterprises Ltd, the conglomerate&rsquo;s flagship listed entity, the cause notice said. These short positions were later squared off by Feb. 22 and reaped $22 million. As of June 1, the Kingdon fund returned $4.1 million of the gains from the Adani short sale to Hindenburg while another $1.4 million has yet to be shared, according to Sebi. In Tuesday&rsquo;s statement, Kotak said Hindenburg has never been an investor in the K India Opportunities Fund. The Indian markets regulator didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to Bloomberg&rsquo;s request for comment. Nor did the Adani Group. Kingdon Capital Management was not immediately reachable outside of US business hours. ",

AI has been a theme for the rivals in blockbuster earnings performances quarter after quarter.Meanwhile, Google and Microsoft have each pledged to be carbon neutral by the end of this decade.Microsoft has an added goal of being carbon-negative, taking climate-harming gas out of the air, by 2050.Amazon, also an AI contender with its AWS cloud computing division, has said it is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2040.\"A sustainable future requires systems-level change, strong government policies, and new technologies,\" Google said in its report.\"We're committed to collaboration and playing our part, every step of the way.\"",

Germany, whose carmakers made a third of their sales last year in China, wants to stop the tariffs, according to a government source, while France has been among the firmest backers. But a majority of countries are still weighing the pros and cons of the escalating trade spat, according to an informal poll by Reuters of EU governments. The issue will be put to members in an advisory vote in the coming weeks, the first official test of support in a landmark case for the Commission. The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind. The bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6% on Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla, BMW and other western automakers. EU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" if at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them. France, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs. \"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said. However, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.  NEGATIVE EFFECTSGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits. Increasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices. Beijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars. The Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100% tariff is likely to do. Tariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU. Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations. \"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said. The EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show. They point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business. The document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed. It offers proof to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy. That leaves the door open to future cases. \"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\" ",

            "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Sebi has issued a show-cause notice to Hindenburg, asking why it should not act against the short-seller for violating norms related to the \"prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trading practices in the securities market\".The notice, dated June 26, was released online by Hindenburg, which took a defiant stand, charging Sebi with not acting on allegations in its Adani report. Hindenburg described the notice as \"nonsense\" and \"nebulous\" and alleged attempts to silence the firm. Hindenburg claimed it only made $4 million from the operation, which resulted in a $153 billion drop in Adani group's valuation.In a statement, Hindenburg said: \"Sebi has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimised by it.\"The thrust of Sebi's notice is that the research firm colluded with its investor partner, misled the public, and used non-public information to manipulate prices and profit from its action. Sebi has alleged that the partner, Kingdon Capital, knew about Hindenburg's research on Adani group before the report was made public and there was a profit-sharing agreement between the two. As per Sebi, Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg in exchange for receiving the report two months in advance. In a fresh twist in the Hindenburg saga, the US short seller said that Kotak Mahindra International created the offshore fund structure used by its investor partner Kingdon Capital to short Adani stocks before its report was published in Jan 2023. Kotak Mahindra Bank informed stock exchanges late on Tuesday that Sebi's showcause notice to Hindenburg and Kingdon included a fund managed by Kotak Mahindra International (KMIL).\"KMIL was informed by Kingdon that the transactions were made on a principal basis, i.e. for themselves. Kingdon never disclosed that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price sensitive information. In fact, they had expressly confirmed that any advice from Kingdon to invest would be basis purely public information,\" Kotak Bank's statement said.\"Neither the fund nor KMIL were aware that Kingdon entities had any association with Hindenburg. The fund and KMIL had no prior knowledge of the publication of the aforesaid Hindenburg report. We deny any allegation of being aware of such report or acting in collusion in any manner with Kingdon or Hindenburg,\" it said.Earlier in the day, Kotak Bank shares dropped 2.4% after Hindenburg disclosed Sebi's notice and said that a Kotak fund was one of the noticees for setting up the offshore structure. In its exchange communication, Kotak said that the showcause notice dated June 26 was received by KMIL on July 2.In its reply to Sebi's showcause notice, Hindenburg questioned the regulator for not highlighting the name of Kotak, the group that facilitated offshore investors' short-selling in Indian markets.By bringing Kotak into the picture in correspondence with Sebi, Hindenburg has sought to support its claim that the firm played by the rules while short-selling and did not cross a line between using proprietary research based on public information and \"use of advance knowledge of non-public information\" for trading, as the regulator alleged.Hindenburg reply also referred to Kotak group founder, Uday Kotak's chairmanship of 2017 Committee on Corporate Governance to bolster the legitimacy of its actions.\"We suspect Sebi's lack of mention of Kotak or any other Kotak board member may be meant to protect yet another powerful Indian businessman from the prospect of scrutiny, a role Sebi seems to embrace\" Hindenburg said.In a statement, a Kotak group spokesperson said, \"KIOF (K India Opportunities Fund - a Sebi-registered FPI regulated by Financial Services Commission of Mauritius), was established in 2013 to enable foreign clients to invest in India. The fund follows due KYC procedures while on-boarding clients and all its investments are made in accordance with all applicable laws. We have cooperated with regulators in relation to our operations and continue to do so.\"The statement also denied any knowledge of investors' association with Hindenburg. \"KMIL and KIOF unequivocally state that Hindenburg has never been a client of the firm nor has it ever been an investor in the fund.,\" the spokesperson said.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: Germany's power sector is relying on cuts made to fossil fuel use for the lion's share of recent decarbonisation efforts, but will need a sustained jump in clean generation to ensure a lasting shift in power production away from polluting fuels. German power generators cut fossil fuel-powered output by 19 per cent through the opening half of 2024 from the same months in 2023, data from LSEG shows. That compares to just a 2.1 per cent rise in clean power generation from the first half of 2023, and indicates that power firms are mainly relying on cuts to fossil fuel use to make progress against energy transition aims. Those cuts to fossil fuel use have helped slash German power sector emissions, which totalled 70 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) for the first 5 months of 2024 compared to 88 million tons during January to May of 2023, data from think tank Ember shows. But sluggish industrial activity has meant that overall power demand totals are also down so far this year, which has allowed power suppliers to reduce total generation by more than 6 per cent compared to the first half of 2023. If Germany's manufacturing and industrial activity picks up momentum over the remainder of 2024, total power needs may climb in tow and could put pressure on power suppliers to increase output from fossil fuels to meet that extra demand.  COAL CUTS Coal-fired generation took the brunt of the fossil fuel output cuts, dropping by just over 17 per cent in the first half of 2024 from the same months last year. To make up for lower coal-fired generation, output from natural gas plants increased by 5 per cent in January-June 2024 from the first half of 2023, while generation from oil-fired plants rose 12 per cent and coal-derived gas plants increased output by 3.7 per cent, LSEG data shows. Altogether, total generation from fossil fuels contracted by 19 per cent during the first half of 2024, and follows a 24 per cent contraction in the whole of 2023 from the year before.  CLEAN MAJORITY The drop in fossil fuel generation has resulted in clean power sources securing a majority share of Germany's power generation mix every month since December 2022. The share of clean power in Germany's power generation mix climbed to a new high of 64.6 per cent during the first half of 2024, compared to 59.3 per cent during the same months of 2023 and an average share of 61 per cent for 2023 as a whole. That said, power firms have been unable to offset all the cuts to fossil fuel use with growth from clean energy sources, especially after Germany shut its national nuclear reactor fleet in April 2023. Nuclear reactors had accounted for around 8 per cent of total power generation in 2022, so the complete cessation of such a notable source of clean energy has been hard to replace. Wind farms have emerged as Germany's largest source of clean power, and accounted for an average share of 37 per cent of total power generation last year, according to LSEG. Solar is the second largest source of German clean power, and generated around 17 per cent of all power last year, while hydro assets generated around 4 per cent.  SEASONAL SWINGS During the first half of 2024, wind power generation climbed 7.6 per cent from the same period in 2023, while solar generation rose by 12.8 per cent and hydro output climbed 5.4 per cent. Solar output is liable to climb further during July and August during the height of summer, and could account for around 30 per cent to 35 per cent of total power generation during those months. However, generation from wind farms and hydro dams historically dip during the summer months due to slower wind speeds and reduced water flows from reservoirs. For power producers who need to maintain power supplies around the clock, the drop off in wind and hydro output may set the stage for greater generation from natural gas plants, especially if German manufacturing activity picks up steam. And any such increase in gas-fired output could in turn open the German power sector to accusations of backsliding on power clean-up commitments. To guard against that in the future, power firms will need to substantially increase total generation from clean sources and also substantially raise the storage capacity that can bridge periods of reduced clean generation. The build-out of an entirely clean power generation system may take several more years and continued high levels of annual investment in clean generation and battery construction. Until then, further periods of clean power growth followed by flare ups in fossil-fired output look likely.By Gavin Maguire",

Industry sources have said the low-priced bids from some successful projects indicated that they would be using cheaper Chinese equipment.The EU is toughening its stance against China on green technologies, to attempt to ensure European industries can compete globally and avoid deepening Europe's reliance on Beijing for key building blocks of the clean energy transition.Brussels last month announced tariffs on imported Chinese electric cars, and is investigating Chinese subsidies for wind and solar suppliers.",

            "articleBody": "BERLIN: For months, Philip Matthias tried to convince his father to install solar panels on their company's roof in the eastern German state of Thuringia, aiming to cut electricity costs and carbon emissions at the metal products factory. Initially sceptical of the 2.3-million-euro ($2.5 million) investment, a substantial sum for the medium-sized Tridelta, his father crunched the numbers and decided to nearly double the project capacity, opting to install photovoltaic modules that could power around 900 households in addition to the factory. \"The PV systems amortize after about 7-1/2 years. The manufacturer gives a guarantee of 20 years. That means this is an extremely lucrative investment,\" Matthias told Reuters. Since the war in Ukraine and the sudden drop in Russia fossil fuel exports to Germany, Berlin has introduced laws to accelerate solar power expansion, part of its plan to cover 80 per cent of the country's energy from renewables by 2030. Encouraged by a feed-in tariff providing a guaranteed price to renewable energy producers selling their power, as well as reduced solar panel costs, German companies are increasingly turning to solar to get around high energy costs. Although Germany has Europe's biggest capacity of solar and wind power generation, its small and medium-sized companies have yet to benefit from lower electricity prices because of high grid fees and taxes they must pay. By generating their own solar power, they avoid those fees and taxes. Companies consumed around 69 per cent of Germany's national electricity in 2023, data by the BDEW utilities association showed. \"As electricity prices in Germany show no signs of decreasing as previously anticipated, companies are increasingly recognising the economic viability of installing solar panels,\" said Marie-Theres Husken, an energy expert for the BVMW association for small- and medium-sized businesses.  CORPORATE SOLAR SHIFT Newly installed photovoltaic capacity on business rooftops rose by 81 per cent year-on-year in the first four months of the year, outpacing the 1 per cent growth in the residential sector, data by the BSW solar power association shows. A May survey by pollster YouGov showed more than half of German companies with suitable roofs planned to install solar power systems in the next three years. BVMW forecasts that nearly all manufacturing companies in Germany will use solar energy by 2030. In response to increasing demand, Germany's largest residential solar power developer, Enpal, said in April it was expanding into the commercial sector. \"The demand was not as instant... but the growth is going to be very sustainable,\" Melchior Schulze Brock, CEO of commercial and industrial solar startup Enviria. An April study by the Freiburg-based Institute for Applied Ecology showed there was potential to install up to 287 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, more than enough to meet Berlin's 2030 target of 215 GW, along German roads, railways, parking lots, and industrial areas. This could significantly reduce reliance on agricultural land where permitting and planning approvals can take up to a decade. A drop in solar panel prices globally since last year has spurred companies to embrace solar energy. \"The market is overrun with cheap but good panels from China. That means that the system that we are building now is about 20 per cent cheaper than a year ago,\" Matthias said. A German legislative package passed in April easing regulation and increasing subsidies for large rooftop systems as well as a pending tax investment reform for real estate funds operating rooftop solar panels, is expected to drive demand further. State feed-in subsidies for large scale rooftop photovoltaic projects, introduced in 2021 and which are selected via tender, have also boosted the trend. The last tender for the subsidised projects in February saw a 107 per cent rise in the number of offers year-on-year, data by the federal grid network agency showed. A feed-in tariff of 9.3 euros cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than Tridelta's power purchasing price, makes it currently cheaper for the company to sell future generated electricity to the grid and buy it back, Matthias said. Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on companies' electricity trading strategies. \"There's a high correlation between the feed-in tariffs and the build-up of solar PV roof top projects,\" Hugo Willink, Executive Director at solar roofs developer Sunrock told Reuters. Sunrock, which won an order from Mercedes Benz in May to build a 23-megawatt solar project on the carmaker's factory roofs, sees Germany as its core market for the coming year.",

            "articleBody": "U.S-based short-seller Hindenburg Research said on Monday that India's securities regulator had sent it a letter outlining suspected violations over its short bet against Adani Group last year and revealed it may \"barely come out above breakeven\" on its trade.  Hindenburg also said Kotak Bank, an Indian firm, created and oversaw an offshore fund structure that was used by its \"investor partner\" to bet against the conglomerate, providing new details of trades that have puzzled investors. The short-seller said it made $4.1 million in gross revenue through \"gains related to Adani shorts from that investor relationship\" and just $31,000 through its short position of Adani's U.S. bonds. It did not name the investor. Characterizing the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) \"show cause\" notice as attempted intimidation, Hindenburg wrote that the regulator had made the \"nebulous allegation\" that Hindenburg's report contained misrepresentations and inaccurate statements meant to mislead readers. \"In our view, SEBI has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimized by it,\" Hindenburg said. SEBI, Adani Enterprises and Kotak did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside working hours.  SEBI has also been probing Adani, but India's top court has given it till August 14 to complete its investigation.  The disclosure of the SEBI notice adds a new twist in the saga unleashed last year when Hindenburg, founded by Nathan Anderson, alleged improper business dealings by Adani. The group, which refuted the allegations, suffered a loss of as much as $150 billion in combined market value after the report, but has since rebounded. Hindenburg's response also sheds some new light on the mechanics of its trade, the details of which had intrigued other investors because Indian securities rules make it hard for foreigners bet against companies there. \"It was a tiny position,\" it said. \"But, to date, our research on Adani is by far the work we are most proud of.\"",

            "articleBody": "After the success of Pavagada Solar park in Tumakuru, the Karnataka government is planning to establish yet another solar park in the district, this time in Madhugiri taluk. The initiative was announced by Energy Minister K J George in Tumakuru. \"The upcoming project will not only scale up Karnataka's clean energy infrastructure, but also holds the potential to significantly enhance environmental stewardship and energy security in the state,\" he said. Madhugiri Solar Park will be developed in a strategic partnership with Tehri Hydro Development Corporation India Limited (THDCIL), owned by the central government. \"This partnership aims to leverage local expertise and resources to identify suitable land parcels essential for advancing Karnataka's renewable energy agenda, instilling confidence in the project's success,\" added George. The energy minister was visiting Tumakuru to review the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM KUSUM) project at the district commissioner's office. \"The subsidy for free electricity for farmers' pump sets is increasing annually. Despite efforts to regularise farmers' pump sets, the issue persists, leading to transformer damage and power supply disruptions due to illegal connections. In this context, we are prioritising the KUSUSM B and Kusum C projects, encouraging the adoption of solar pump sets,\" George added. Outlining the details of the Kusum C project, the minister said, \"To generate 1 MW of electricity under the Kusum C project, 4-5 acres of land are needed. If government land is used, it will be provided free of cost and leased for 25 years. Lessees will pay Rs. 25,000 per acre annually during the lease period. These funds will be deposited in the district collector's account and allocated to develop local anganwadis, schools, and panchayats.\" The PM KUSUM initiative, a joint effort of the central and the state governments, was launched to address farmers' energy needs and make agriculture more sustainable. Accelerating transformative energy security for Indian agriculture involves implementing comprehensive strategies to ensure reliable and sustainable energy sources for farmers, said Gaurav Gupta, additional chief secretary, energy department of Karnataka, during the review meeting. \"We will select land around substations for this initiative. So far, 27 substations have been chosen, with an additional 12 substations to be selected in the next phase for Tumakuru district. Work has already begun in some substations, and surveys have been conducted. The aim is to benefit farmers with locally generated electricity,\" added Gupta. The meeting was also attended by state Home Minister G Parameshwar, who is also the district in-charge minister, cooperation minister K N Rajanna, state government special representative in Delhi T B Jayachandra, MLA K Shadakshari, BESCOM managing director Mahantesh Bilagi and Tumakuru district collector Shubha Kalyan.",

According to the agreement signed in New Delhi, SGEL will provide around 4,500 MW of carbon-free energy from solar and wind sources to support AM Green&rsquo;s upcoming green ammonia facilities.This renewable energy will be integrated with pumped hydro storage by AM Green to ensure consistent power supply to its facilities. The agreement was formalized in the presence of senior officials including Sh. Akhileshwar Singh, Director of Finance at SJVN Ltd, and Sh. Ajay Kumar Singh, CEO of SGEL, among others.Under the phased project plan, SGEL aims to deliver the first 1,500 MW within two years, contributing to SJVN's broader goal to expand its renewable energy capacity to 25,000 MW by 2030 and 50,000 MW by 2040.AM Green, backed by the founders of Greenko Group, targets producing 5 million tonne per annum of green ammonia by 2030. This production capacity is poised to fulfill about one-fifth of India&rsquo;s target under the National Green Hydrogen Mission and 10 percent of Europe&rsquo;s target for green hydrogen imports by 2030.Mahesh Kolli, Founder, Greenko Group &amp; AM Green, commented on the deal, \"We are delighted to partner with SJVN on one of the world&rsquo;s largest carbon-free, renewable energy supply contracts. This partnership demonstrates AM Green&rsquo;s emerging leadership position as a global clean energy transition solutions platform while contributing to India&rsquo;s ambition of emerging as an exporter of reliable, sustainable and lowest-cost green molecules and its derivatives accelerating industrial decarbonisation globally.\"Ajay Singh, CEO, SJVN Green, said, \"We are elated to embark on this collaboration with AM Green, as it holds tremendous potential for accelerating the development of renewable assets in India. The project also marks SJVN&rsquo;s foray into supplying power to private sector entities. With our ambitious capacity addition targets, SJVN is actively pursuing opportunities across the spectrum and is keen to take forward this arrangement with AM Green.\"Additionally, AM Green has recently secured several strategic partnerships and investments, notably with Gentari Sdn Bhd and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, to bolster its position in the global green ammonia market. The company is on the brink of making a final investment decision for its first 2 MTPA green ammonia project early this year, advancing its competitive stance both in India and internationally.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a significant move towards sustainable infrastructure development, Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Member (Science) of Niti Aayog, released new guidelines for the utilization of steel slag in road construction. This announcement was made at the First International Conference on Steel Slag Road, jointly organized by CSIR-CRRI and PHDCCI in New Delhi.The guidelines advocate for the processed use of steel slag aggregates in road construction, tapping into the waste from steel industries to foster environmental sustainability. According to Dr. Saraswat, the implementation of these guidelines is expected to yield substantial benefits, including cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced performance of roads.Highlighting the critical role of this initiative, Dr. Saraswat said, \"Adopting these guidelines for construction and maintenance of road network using steel slag is expected to bring numerous benefits, including cost saving, reduced environmental impact, and improved road performance.\" He linked the initiative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s \"Waste to Wealth\" vision, noting significant contributions by Dr. Manoranjan Parida, Director of CRRI, and Shri Satish Pandey, Principal Scientist.Shri Nagendra Nath Sinha, Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Steel, emphasized the research and development efforts leading to these guidelines. He noted, \"The Ministry of Steel sponsored a major R&amp;D project to CSIR-Central Road Research Institute to facilitate large-scale utilization of steel slag as a substitute for natural aggregates in road construction.\"The guidelines also detail a framework for the safe handling and storage of steel slag to prevent environmental contamination, reflecting a comprehensive approach to sustainable construction practices.Dr. N. Kalaiselvi, Secretary, DSIR and DG, CSIR, also supported the initiative, mentioning the Steel Slag Road between Mumbai and Goa as a landmark project underlining the efficacy and potential of this technology.The conference also saw participation from industry leaders who discussed the broader applications and environmental benefits of using steel slag in road construction. Mr. Ranjan Dhar of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India highlighted the success of India&rsquo;s First Steel Slag Road at Hazira, Surat, which used 100 thousand tonnes of processed steel slag and has received national and international recognition for its innovative approach.",

The gain from 52% in the same period last year lifted the coverage to a record high for a six-month period, the research centre said in a statement. Germany's electricity imports rose 21% during the period, while exports fell by 15.5%, it added. The new record in renewable energy use was driven in part by solar panels, which generated 12.8% more energy, accounting for 14.7% of gross electricity generation. That was after a record high in solar panel installations last year, the centre said. The data was calculated under European Union requirements that base the share on usage rather than on production, a method also adopted by the Berlin government for its climate target definitions, BDEW said.

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: China's latest monthly power report excluded data on usage rates by generation source, after recent data showed declining utilisation at renewable power plants, a trend that was expected to continue. In a monthly data release on Friday, China's energy administration published only the average operating hours of all types of power plants for January to May. Previous data releases had broken down the statistics by generation source, including hydro, thermal, nuclear, wind, and solar generation. Usage rates for wind and solar had been expected to drop further after the government relaxed rules on renewable power utilisation in May. The report did not give a reason for the change and China's energy administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The previous month's data release - which captured January-April and was the last to include the detailed statistics - showed that solar and wind plant utilisation fell while hydro and thermal plant utilisation increased. In the first four months of the year, the average operating hours of wind and solar power plants dropped by 77 hours and 42 hours to 789 and 373 hours, respectively. Hydro plant operating hours rose by 48 hours to 783 hours on average and thermal power plants rose by 23 hours to 1,448 hours, respectively. China's cabinet said in a CO2 action plan on May 29 that it would increase the limit on renewable power curtailment from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, while also accelerating plans to build ultra-high voltage transmission lines. Curtailment is when grid managers stop a certain amount of supply coming onto the grid to maintain balances with demand. The previous limit of 5 per cent was in line with rates of 1.5-4 per cent in most big markets, according to the International Energy Agency. The change is expected to allow more renewable capacity to be built, but at lower utilisation rates. Average utilisation hours of all power generators surveyed were 1,372 during the first five months of the year, 59 hours lower than in the same period of 2023, according to the energy bureau data on Friday. Last August, China suspended the release of youth unemployment data, which had hit record highs, before resuming the reports in January with a new methodology that excludes students.",

            "articleBody": "Lubumbashi: In the boiling sun, Mifie and her neighbours work hard to grow vegetables in fields at the edge of a Congolese river which campaigners say has long been polluted by a copper and cobalt mine.\"We cannot live properly with this polluted water,\" the pregnant 23-year-old said among the cabbages, amaranth and other vegetables at her plot in DR Congo's southeastern mining region.Irrigation channels from the Luano river can be seen weaving paths through fields to bring water to feed the crops.  But acidity in the water hampers agricultural production and causes health problems such as skin and eye complaints, villagers say. The Democratic Republic of Congo is Africa's top producer of copper, vital for energy storage, electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines. It is also the world's largest producer of cobalt -- a key component of batteries used in electronics and electric vehicles. For more than 100 years, an abundance of mineral wealth has driven economic activity in the vast country's second biggest city, Lubumbashi.But the mines also produce water, air and ground pollution, NGOs say, demanding tighter regulation of the sector. Lying on the outskirts of the city, the Luano river is the main discharge point for wastewater from the nearby Ruashi mine, three NGOs said in a report in 2021.Environmental charity PremiCongo, Afrewatch, which campaigns for fair use of natural resources, and ACIDH human rights group conducted a study among people living near the large open cast mine operated by Ruashi Mining.Chinese company Jinchuan Group owns a 75-percent share in Ruashi Mining, while Congolese business Gecamines owns the rest.\"The three communities are some of the poorest people in Lubumbashi,\" Christian Bwenda, PremiCongo coordinator, told AFP.- 'Sore eyes' - Crops do not grow in the acidic earth as they used to, say the farmers, who resort to buying fertilisers.Mifie, who declined to give her full name, earns 200,000 Congolese francs ($70) a month.But a packet of fertiliser costs 2,500 Congolese francs (about 90 cents) and sometimes she buys as many as five a day. \"I work a lot to earn a little. I don't have enough income,\" said another farmer Emmie Kasungo, standing with her three daughters in tall stalks of corn. Strawberry farmer Celestin, who also declined to give his full name, does not use fertilisers as customers want organic fruit. \"People prefer to not consume strawberries with polluted water,\" he also said. But standing in knee-high wellington boots, he told AFP that he had suffered skin problems which he blamed on water from the Luano river.\"When I was working without boots, I had some sores. It hurt,\" he said.Teacher Ngoy Therese, 58, says around 60 percent of the children she sees have health issues related to the water in the area and dust from the mine.\"We have people with sore eyes,\" she told AFP.Local activist Christophe Kabwita pointed to marks on his skin which he believes come from mining pollution. Around the mine \"new illness\" has appeared that was not there before, he said.- 'Avoid the water' - Lubumbashi University professor Arthur Kaniki, who also helps run its environmental analysis laboratory, has carried out studies of rivers near mining sites in Upper Katanga province where Lubumbashi is the main city. He said water near many mines often shows a \"state of pollution\" and, in some rivers, an \"elevated concentration\" of copper and cobalt. Pollution from the \"presence of solid matter\" is \"generated from mining\", he said.\"This risks contaminating the food chain, it's an enormous risk for the health of the population,\" Kaniki told AFP. \"We have asked the population to avoid using this water, especially for direct consumption or for watering (plants).\"Sediment collected from the village of Luano shows that the water is acidic, while tests of the Luano river show the same, the 2021 study said. \"The problem of pollution always exists where there are areas of mines,\" Georges Mawine, former mines minister for Upper Katanga, told AFP.In response to AFP requests for comment, Ruashi Mining said it conducted environmental monitoring but gave no information on the results.\"We have an environmental department that regularly takes water and air samples,\" Elisa Kalasa, social and community head of department for Ruashi Mining, told AFP in an email.\"Ruashi Mining has improved water for the community in partnership with (water company) Regideso,\" she added, without giving details.But for Bwenda, the solution is simple.\"The company must take all measures possible so that the negative impacts on the life of people are reduced as much as possible,\" he said.",

This method involves deriving high-surface area activated carbon from coconut husk, which is a major agricultural residue in Kerala. The researchers under Dr Xavier T S, Department of Physics, Government College for Women, developed the unique method, a release said here on Monday. \"Activated carbon produced in this manner utilising microwave technology is relatively inexpensive and exhibits exceptional supercapacitor capability,\" said Xavier. Supercapacitors, a revolutionary technology with significantly higher capacitance and energy storage capacity than conventional capacitors, have emerged as a vital component in the quest for sustainable energy storage solutions. Their exceptional attributes, including high power density, rapid charge-discharge capabilities, and excellent cyclic stability, make them an indispensable element in various energy storage and power management applications, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy systems, the release said. The search for an ideal supercapacitor electrode material has been a significant challenge, necessitating eco-friendly, cost-effective, and safe solutions. In this context, coconut husk-derived activated carbon has garnered considerable attention in the field of supercapacitors, it said. \"The prototype supercapacitors made of coconut husk-derived activated carbon developed by the team are four times more efficient than existing supercapacitors,\" said Merin Tomy, who is part of the team. The research team involves Merin Tomy, Ganesh S G, Anu M A, Sreelakshmi S R, and Dr Xavier T S who leveraged the innovative microwave-assisted method designed at the Centralised Common Instrumentation Facility (CCIF) at Government Women's College. The research was published in the esteemed journal Sustainable Resource Management, a journal of the American Chemical Society. Efforts are also underway to increase its production for industrial purposes. Moreover, ongoing research has paved the way for the potential applications of activated carbon in water purification and sensor development, underscoring its vast potential in sustainable energy storage and beyond, the release further said. The successful development of coconut husk-derived activated carbon by the research team marks a significant breakthrough in the field of energy storage, it said. Utilising an advanced microwave pyrolysis reactor, the team was able to produce high-quality carbon in a mere five minutes, eliminating impurities like ash and generating zero waste. The device's high-power output, capable of powering two LEDs for 20 minutes, surpasses existing research by four times, paving the way for commercial energy storage applications, according to the release. This achievement showcases the potential of coconut husk-derived activated carbon to revolutionise the energy storage landscape, enabling sustainable and efficient energy solutions. The team's innovative approach and results have far-reaching implications, positioning this technology at the forefront of the quest for reliable and eco-friendly energy storage solutions. CCIF, funded by the Government of Kerala, is the first of its kind in the state and is equipped with world-class state-of-the-art facilities, including advanced instruments like NMR spectrometer, BET analyzer, fluorimeter, Electrochemical workstation, and PCR machines. With a vision to foster collaborative research and innovation, CCIF provides access to these world-class facilities at a reasonable service charge, ensuring that researchers from diverse institutions can leverage its capabilities.

The World Bank on June 29, approved USD 1.5 billion in financing to accelerate India's development of low-carbon energy.\"The financing will help India promote low-carbon energy by scaling up renewable energy, developing green hydrogen, and stimulating climate finance for low-carbon energy investments.,\" the World Bank said in a blog post.Apart from this second phase of financing stimulus, last year in June 2023, the World Bank approved the USD 1.5 billion First Low-Carbon Energy Programmatic Development Policy Operation, which supported the waiver of transmission charges for renewable energy in green hydrogen projects.With this financing, efforts will be made to enhance the market capability for green hydrogen. The emphasis will also be given to scaling up renewable energy and stimulating finance for low-carbon energy investments, as per the statement.The second Low-Carbon Energy Programmatic Development Policy Operation will support reforms to boost the production of green hydrogen and electrolyzers, critical technology needed for green hydrogen production. The operation also supports reforms to boost renewable energy penetration, for instance, by incentivizing battery energy storage solutions and amending the Indian Electricity Grid Code to improve renewable energy integration into the grid.Recognising the need to separate India's economic growth from emission growth, the World Finance Organisation pointed out that decoupling economic growth from emissions growth will require scaling up renewable energy, especially in hard-to-abate industrial sectors.It added that India will require an expansion of green hydrogen production and consumption as well as a faster development of climate finance to boost the mobilisation of finance for low-carbon investments. The reforms supported by the operation are expected to result in the production of at least 450,000 metric tons of green hydrogen and 1,500 MW of electrolyzers per year from the financial year 2025-26 onwards.In addition, it will also help to increase renewable energy capacity and support reductions in emissions by 50 million tons per year. The operation will also support steps to further develop a national carbon credit market. ",

IFFCO had approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in March seeking to restrain Triumph Offshore and SEL from issuing any share/securities to lenders for paying loans and passing any such resolution without its approval.  In its petition, IFFCO had argued that it was pre-paying the debt and it may result into dilution of its shareholding in Triumph Offshore.  A two-member bench of the NCLT allowed IFFCO to withdraw its plea.  \"Counsel for applicants seeks permission to withdraw the application. They have also filed an affidavit. In view of the same, permission is granted,\" said the NCLT order passed on June 27.

Emissions-free sources produced 74% of EU electricity in January-June, of which 50% was from renewable sources like wind and solar, and 24% from nuclear, industry association Eurelectric said. \"The electricity generation of Europe has never had such a low-carbon profile before,\" Eurelectric Secretary General Kristian Ruby told Reuters. Coal produced 9% of EU electricity and gas 13% - the lowest shares for each fossil fuel for the same period in any year to date. The main driver of Europe's changing energy mix is the rapid installation of renewable energy capacity. The EU built 56 gigawatts of new solar power capacity in 2023 - the highest in any year to date - and 16GW of new wind capacity. However, Europe's electricity demand has also decreased, making it easier for green sources to cover a bigger share of the overall mix. EU power demand was 5.8% lower in the first half of this year than in the same period in 2021. European energy prices surged to record highs in 2022 after Russia slashed gas supplies to Europe. The resulting energy crisis forced industries and consumers to use less energy to curb their bills - with some industries yet to recover production to pre-crisis levels, depressing their energy consumption. More renewable energy will help Europe meet its climate targets and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. But there are signs countries' ageing power grids are struggling to cope with the changing energy mix. Belgian power grid operator Elia warned last month that a recent jump in Belgium's solar power capacity will cause periods of surplus cheap energy this summer, making it harder to balance the grid. Ruby urged policymakers to invest in upgrading power grids to cope with bigger shares of renewable capacity, including by adding storage capacity to absorb cheap excess power so it doesn't go to waste. \"We need a physical build-out of the grid with quite a bit of urgency,\" he said.

            "articleBody": "It also banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, in addition to imposing a ban on technology to extract and separate rare earths.  China has unveiled a list of rare earth regulations aimed at protecting supplies in the name of national security, laying out rules on the mining, smelting and trade in the critical materials used to make products from magnets in electric vehicles to consumer electronics. The regulations, issued by the State Council or cabinet on Saturday, say rare earth resources belong to the state, and that the government will oversee the development of the industry around rare earths - a group of 17 minerals of which China has in recent years become the world's dominant producer, accounting for nearly 90% of global refined output. Their global industrial significance is such that under a law that entered into force in May the EU set ambitious 2030 targets for domestic production of minerals crucial in the green transition - particularly rare earths due to their use in permanent magnets that power motors in EVs and wind energy. EU demand is forecast to soar sixfold in the decade to 2030 and sevenfold by 2050. The new Chinese regulations, which will take effect on Oct. 1, say the State Council will establish a rare earth product traceability information system. Enterprises in rare earth mining, smelting and separation, and the export of rare earth products, shall establish a product flow record system, shall \"truthfully\" record the flow, and shall enter it into the traceability system, the State Council said. China already last year introduced restrictions on exports of the elements germanium and gallium, used widely in the chip-making sector, citing the need to protect national security and interests. It also banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, in addition to imposing a ban on technology to extract and separate rare earths. Those rules fanned fears that restrictions in rare earth supplies might help increase tensions with the West, particularly the United States, which accuses China of using economic coercion to influence other countries. Beijing denies the claim. China's rare earths regulations also come as the EU gears up to impose provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs on July 4 to protect the 27-state bloc from what it says is a flood of EVs produced with unfair state subsidies, though both sides have said they plan talks on the proposed tariffs.

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Google said it has taken a stake in Taiwan's New Green Power and could buy up to 300 megawatts of renewable energy from the BlackRock fund-owned firm to help cut its carbon emissions and those of suppliers. Companies are being pushed to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to their operations and value chains by investors and Big Tech firms have been among the most ambitious in their targets. Google aims to constantly run on carbon-free energy wherever it operates. Yet sector growth in demand for data-processing capacity to power artificial intelligence has seen emissions jump. Taiwan, a major site for Google's cloud technology with a data centre and company offices, still relied on fossil fuels to generate nearly 85% of its power, Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's Global Head of Data Center Energy told Reuters. \"The goal of this investment is really to support the build out of a large-scale solar pipeline in Taiwan,\" Corio added. Regions such as Asia Pacific can be harder to decarbonise due to less developed infrastructure and restrictions limiting the ability of corporate users to buy green power. New Green Power, owned by a fund managed by BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure business, was one of the leading solar developers and operators in Taiwan, BlackRock's Global Head of Climate Infrastructure David Giordano told Reuters. Google and BlackRock both declined to specify the size of the equity stake being taken in NGP, but Corio said the investment was expected to drive the equity and debt financing for the build-out of its 1 gigawatt (GW) pipeline. Taiwan is targeting 20 GW of solar capacity by 2025 and up to 80 GW by 2050, BlackRock said. Corio said that as well as using some of the solar power it buys to drive its own operations, Google would also be able to offer some to its suppliers and manufacturers in the region. Sharing with suppliers would help Google lower its so-called Scope 3 emissions, those tied to its value chain, she added. ",

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL) is set to double its installed solar power generation capacity in the next 5-10 years with plans to install new plants in remote locations, its Managing Director S Suhas told ETEnergyWorld. CIAL is the world&rsquo;s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy. With seven solar plants, a solar carport, and floating solar panels, it has an installed capacity of 50 MW at present. &ldquo;We have decided to double our installed capacity of solar power generation in the next 5-10 years and are prepared to develop more solar production plants if there is a hike in energy needs, which means development of additional energy sources in adjacent districts,&rdquo; Suhas said in an exclusive interaction.He said that this target involves the installation of new solar plants in remote locations, similar to the Payyanur plant. &ldquo;The investment for scaling up solar capacity will be substantial, reflecting the ambitious targets set by CIAL. This investment will be meticulously planned, sourced from a combination of internal funds and green energy subsidies,&rdquo; he added.In addition to solar projects, CIAL also plans to venture into run-of-the-river hydroelectric projects &ndash; it already has a commissioned project in Arippara. &ldquo;The identification of suitable locations for both solar and hydro projects is underway, ensuring that the chosen sites will optimise energy production while minimising environmental impact,&rdquo; he said. He added that with these initiatives, CIAL will also contribute excess power to the state grid.On the recent MoU with BPCL for a green hydrogen pilot plant, CIAL&rsquo;s MD informed that they are exploring an integrated production model to produce green hydrogen where the electricity will be sourced from CIAL&rsquo;s solar plants. &ldquo;The plan for the green hydrogen plant has been set in motion since the agreement in February 2024. While specific milestones and the current stage of development have not been detailed, such projects typically follow a phased approach, starting with design, procurement, construction, and commissioning,&rdquo; he said. He added that the timeline for completion can vary, but pilot projects like this one might take a year or two to become fully operational.In February this year, CIAL signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-run Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) for setting up the country&rsquo;s first green hydrogen plant in an airport.According to the agreement, BPCL will invest Rs 30 crore which will cover the costs of technology, infrastructure, and operations management of the 1,000 kW plant at Kochi Airport. Whereas, CIAL will provide suitable land, water, and green energy for the plant which is expected to be completed in early 2025.On new technology adoption, Suhas said that they are exploring the potential of smart grid technologies. &ldquo;We are actively monitoring advancements in areas such as energy storage solutions, geothermal energy, and bioenergy, which could complement our existing infrastructure. Additionally, we are exploring the potential of smart grid technologies to improve energy efficiency and management,&rdquo; he said. He added that their approach is to evaluate and pilot new technologies that can enhance CIAL&rsquo;s operational efficiency. CIAL produces 200,000 units of power daily which exceeds the airport&rsquo;s needs, making it power positive. By April 2024, it generated 35 crore units of power, cutting carbon emissions by 28,000 metric tonnes annually.",

The project will be constructed in an area of 19 hectares and completed within three months. It will produce 22.73 million units of power every year, generating an income of Rs 8 crore. This project will also help in reducing 791 tonnes of carbon emission, a statement issued here said. The chief minister said this was the second solar power project in Una district after the 32 MW Pekhubela project, which was completed within a record time of six months and will generate income of Rs 20 crore. He said that despite being a power-plus state, Himachal Pradesh purchases electricity from the open market between October and March by spending around Rs 1,500 crore as the power production in the hydroelectric projects minimises during winters due to receding water level in rivers. The state government has signed an agreement with the Oil India Company for the production of green hydrogen and emphasis was being laid on harnessing solar energy, he said, adding that the government was also encouraging harnessing solar power in the private sector as well. Sukhu, who also inspected water sports activities in Andrauli in the Kutlehar, said the state government was giving added priority to the promotion of the tourism sector. He noted that the government would develop the Andrauli area to increase footfall, besides making it an attraction for tourists visiting the state. Tourism was an important sector for strengthening the state's economy and offers ample employment and self-employment opportunities to the youth, he added. He further said the government was actively promoting religious, adventure and eco-tourism to ensure that those visiting the state have a memorable experience to cherish. He reiterated that the government aims to attract five crore tourists annually in the near future.",

NDCs are national climate plans to achieve the goals set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement, including limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the 1850-1900 average. With the Earth's global surface temperature already 1.15 degrees Celsius above the average in 1850-1900, climate scientists say countries need to take urgent action to reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions by at least 43 per cent by 2030 (compared to 2019 levels) to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Developing nations argue they cannot be expected to reduce CO2 emissions faster if developed countries -- historically responsible for climate change -- do not provide enhanced financial support. Now, rich countries are expected to raise more than USD 100 billion, with developing countries demanding trillions of dollars to tackle climate change.",

            "articleBody": "The green transition currently high on the agenda in Europe will create more opportunities for cooperation and trade between India and Bulgaria, India's Ambassador to Bulgaria Sanjay Rana has said. The year 2024 is being celebrated as the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Bulgaria.  Rana was in Burgas on the Black Sea coast, near the Bulgarian capital Sofia, on Thursday to get acquainted with the opportunities for deepening economic cooperation.  Economic relations between Bulgaria and India have been on the upswing over the past 10 years, he told the Bulgarian news agency BTA.  There has been an increase in the exchange of construction materials and various special-purpose tools between the two countries, he added.  According to BTA, the Indian envoy said that the two sides are now finding new opportunities, including opportunities to trade components for electric vehicles and specific equipment for the renewable energy sector.  \"The green transition currently taking place in Europe will create more opportunities for cooperation and trade between India and Bulgaria,\" he said.  Specifically on the Burgas region of the country, he described it as one of the most dynamically developing regions in Bulgaria, as many economic activities take place there.  Burgas is a \"gateway\" to Bulgaria because of its ports and is becoming an increasingly important hub for trade between India and Bulgaria. With the development of logistics and railways, Bulgaria is becoming an extremely important partner for India, he emphasised.  The ambassador said that Bulgaria and India have a sustainable economic and cultural cooperation, and in recent years, new opportunities have opened up, given the growing interest in sustainable technologies, electric vehicles and renewable energy sources.  Rana also commented on the idea of hiring third-country workers in Bulgaria, announcing that India has expressed its desire to the Bulgarian government to conclude a bilateral agreement in this direction.  According to him, this will benefit the big employers in Bulgaria as they need well-trained manpower, an area where India can contribute.  India already has similar agreements with Italy, Germany, France and Austria, he added.",

            "articleBody": "London: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Thursday urged investors to get behind cutting-edge climate technologies he says would drive a \"green industrial revolution\" and a next wave of global prosperity.Over three days in an upmarket London venue, Gates showcased more than 100 companies making ground on cutting planet-heating emissions from carbon-intensive sectors most responsible for climate change.Gates is a firm believer in the power of innovation to drive breakthroughs in heavily polluting industries like manufacturing, energy and transport.He is the single largest investor in a fund he established in 2015 that has ploughed around $2.2 billion into early-stage technologies like low-carbon cement, zero-emissions aviation and sustainable building materials.But in the quest to deploy these technologies more quickly at scale, Gates is seeking to widen the investor base from venture capitalists to pension and sovereign wealth funds. Many of the innovations he has bankrolled are still at the lab level and not making a dent on the heat-trapping gases that drive global warming, let alone a return on investment.Critics say climate technology is a costly distraction when deep reductions in emissions are needed today, as well as money to help the developing world cope with climate change.Gates acknowledged that innovation alone would not solve the problem, but said there were several reasons to be optimistic.Some of these companies are already rolling out innovations, he said, while others are showing great progress in short time.\"I think the clock is moving forward because of human ingenuity,\" he told reporters at the close of his Breakthrough Energy summit at a 19th-century dockyard in London.\"I do think we can provide all services that mankind wants with zero emissions without making the cost of those services higher... I don't think I am crazy to be optimistic.\"- 'Green industrial revolution' -Less than a decade ago, Gates said, there was very little investor interest in climate technologies. He raised an initial $1 billion with other ultra-wealthy investors including Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Alibaba's Jack Ma, and their first summit in 2022 attracted a few hundred attendees.But investors beyond deep-pocketed philanthropists are starting to pay attention to climate start-ups long deemed too risky a bet, industry figures show.At the London event, Gates brought together around 1,500 executives from banks, state-backed investment funds and major businesses.In one pavilion, potential investors inspected hydrogen-electric aircraft engines designed by ZeroAvia, hunks of low-carbon steel manufactured by Boston Metal, and an enormous magnet used by Commonwealth Fusion Systems to test fusion power. Source, a company that uses a \"hydropanel\" to harvest water from vapour in the atmosphere, quenched thirsts on a hot summer's night.The fast rise in investor interest was obvious and understandable, said Tim Heidel, CEO at Veir, a company backed by Gates that is exploring high-temperature conduction to improve electricity transmission.\"They have an opportunity to build some of the largest companies on the planet,\" Heidel told AFP at a reception night where attendees drank cocktails with names such as \"electricity elixir\" and listened to a string quartet. Gates told investors that \"if you're helping to solve climate, the chance of building very large, very profitable companies\" would follow.\"I think it's fair to say that what you're seeing... (with) those companies is the foundation for this green industrial revolution,\" he said in an opening pitch after walking on stage to the sound of \"Revolution\" by the Beatles.- 'Life or death' -The optimism stood in stark contrast to the diplomatic climate meetings hosted by the United Nations. Crucial negotiations in June toward a new target on climate finance ended in bitter disagreement over how much rich countries should pay poorer ones for their emissions.Veteran US diplomat John Kerry said it would be the private sector -- not governments -- that would raise the trillions of dollars needed every year to confront the challenge, and new technology would drive that progress.\"It's not your average technology mission. This is life or death, literally,\" the former American climate envoy said Thursday.This year is shaping up as the hottest on record, with floods devastating swathes of the globe while many parts of Europe, Asia and Latin America are sweltering under record-breaking heatwaves.Without urgent emission cuts this decade, the world risks breaching 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above industrial levels, the benchmark limit of the Paris climate accord.Julia Reinaud, a senior director at Breakthrough Energy, said it was time to \"double down\" and get early-stage technologies from prototype to power grid. \"We don't have the 30 years that it took to develop solar to where it is today,\" she told AFP.",

Renewable energy (RE) plays a pivotal role in GH2 production, but the success of this role largely rests on the effectiveness of the grid transmission lines and the allied infrastructure that transmit power from the RE power generation centres to the GH2 production plants. India has grown its RE capacity from 35.8 giga watts (GW) in 2014 to 144.7 GW this year, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%. Further, to achieve its target of 500 GW of non-fossil-fuel-based installed generation capacity by 2030, the nation needs to put in place a minimum of 50 GW of RE capacity every year till 2030. In 2023 alone, a substantial addition of power transmission lines (of approximately 15,593 circuit kilometres) was made to integrate new generation capacities (both RE and conventional sources), and to meet the rising power demand. As an RE-rich country, India, under its National Green Hydrogen Mission, plans to produce 5 million tons per annum (MTPA) of GH2 by 2030. A report published by the European Union in 2020 found that for producing 1 kg of green hydrogen, 55 kilowatt hour (kWH) of electricity is required. Considering this, India is likely to require 250 terawatt hour (TWh) of RE to produce 5 MTPA of green hydrogen.India&rsquo;s target of installing 500 GW of non-fossil-fuel-based generation capacity can enable the generation of approximately 983 TWh of electricity. Assuming we achieve the RE targets, producing 5 MTPA of GH2&mdash;for which 250 TWh of electricity is required&mdash;can be possible. Actually, on considering the additional electricity requirements of approximately 30 kWh towards the effective production of 1 kg of GH2, the total electricity requirement amounts to 85 kWh per kg of GH2, which translates to 386 TWh for 5 MTPA of GH2. Nevertheless, the target-driven availability of RE can technically fulfil the needs of green hydrogen production plants. While India has the capability to supply the renewable electricity required for producing GH2, identifying a suitable location for GH2 production plants can be a challenge. Locating them near a functioning urban centre may overload the existing transmission infrastructure, resulting in higher transmission losses and unwarranted power outages. To circumvent these systemic issues, new transmission infrastructure or upgradation of the existing transmission infrastructure to a higher capacity can be planned, depending on the need. Often, the restructuring of transmission infrastructure is an expensive, time-consuming ordeal. To avoid the risks of overloading the transmission infrastructure, the GH2 production plants should be located near RE plants, which are usually situated far away from GH2 demand centres. This set-up can also reduce possible transmission losses in the system.That being said, setting up GH2 production plants near RE power plants has its own concerns. Transportation of the produced hydrogen is an onerous task. Hydrogen can either be transported through pipelines directly or through trucks (tanks) after compressing it. This would require additional processes of expansion at the demand side (where GH2 will be utilised) before use. For example, hydrogen can be used as a reducing agent in steel manufacturing plants. The GH2 produced will need to be compressed at GH2 production centres before being transported. Subsequently, this compressed GH2 needs to be expanded at the steel units before use. For optimal siting of GH2 production plants, it is crucial to find out if it is more expensive to bring electricity to the GH2 production plants or to send hydrogen from GH2 production plants to the GH2 demand centres. A 2021 study by Guidehouse observes that transporting hydrogen offers more advantages&mdash;in terms of costs and volumes&mdash; than re-structuring the power transmission infrastructure (upgrading existing infrastructure or adding a new corridor). Simply put, on a kilometre-to-kilometre basis, building new pipelines (across varying diameters) to transport hydrogen is a more viable option, as compared to erecting new transmission lines (across different voltage levels). A systemic framework based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is needed to arrive at ideal locations for setting up GH2 production plants. The framework can identify the potential sweet spots, considering three criteria: (a) proximity to power plants (avoids transmission overload); (b) proximity to demand centres (avoids hydrogen transport); and (c) proximity to water sources (minimises transport of water). In summary, India's efforts to produce green hydrogen must take into account effective planning towards siting the GH2 production plants. This will enable the shift to a low-carbon economy, while meeting the country-specific RE goals in the long run.",

            "articleBody": "At nearly every turn, the pace of the solar rollout has been greatly underestimated. The chart below shows it best. While forecasts have stuck to sober projections of linear growth, the reality has been an exponential curve as costs have plummeted. In 2023, solar panels provided 6 per cent of the world's electricity, and BloombergNEF expects another 585 gigawatts of new solar capacity to be installed throughout 2024.It looks like there's little that could dull solar's shine (though the full effect of ramped-up US tariffs on Chinese panels remain to be seen.) Yet, unless we're able to figure out an affordable way to put panels in outer space, at some point there will be a limiting factor: earthly space. Arguments over land use are already bubbling up in Europe and slowing the deployment of utility-scale photovoltaic projects.There's a particular tension between agricultural land and solar farms. Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni said that solar panels were a \"threat to food sovereignty,\" and the government has issued an emergency decree banning farmers from leasing their land to solar developers. Those hoping to diversify their revenue streams must invest directly in the infrastructure themselves, which must now be at least 2.1 meters (7 fetall to allow food to continue growing underneath.In the UK, Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said that solar power shouldn't compromise food security and has urged local councils to reject projects on high-quality agricultural land. Similar frictions are cropping up in Spain, Romania and the Netherlands.But the fears greatly outweigh the genuine risks to food production - and attempts to control where the solar rollout happens may end up being net negative for farmers.   For context, it's worth exploring just how much land solar would take up should the British government reach its power-output target of 70 gigawatts by 2035. A 2022 analysis by climate and energy publisher Carbon Brief found that ground-mounted solar panels covered less than 0.1 per cent of land in the UK, requiring an average of 6 acres per megawatt of capacity. Future solar farms can use space much more efficiently, with an average of just 3 acres per megawatt, so adding an additional 38 gigawatts of ground-mounted solar power (assuming the current capacity is increased by up to five times) would require another 464 square kilometers, totaling 0.3 per cent of the UK's land area. Even in the unlikely event that all ground-mounted solar panels were situated on farmland, they would cover approximately 0.41 per cent of the country's utilized agricultural area. Given that climate change has been identified as the biggest medium to long-term risk for UK food security, quibbling over less than a percentage of farmland doesn't seem worth it.Besides, it also assumes that agriculture and photovoltaics can't exist side-by-side, when the evidence suggests that they can complement each other nicely. A 2023 study showed that agrivoltaics (in which land is used to produce energy and food at the same time) can often enhance crop and forage yields: In a semi-arid environment, yields of tomatoes grown alongside panels were nearly threefold higher than in a traditional system. Likewise, animal production in grazing lands can also be enhanced by reducing heat stress.   In the Netherlands, a raspberry farmer has installed one of Europe's largest agrivoltaic arrays after a pilot project in 2020 proved successful. Berries are typically grown under plastic sheeting to protect them from severe weather conditions, but grower Maarten van Hoof found that growing under solar panels worked much better - withstanding wind, rain and reducing plastic waste. Those concerned about food security may also forget that solar power can provide a lifeline to cash-strapped farmers who are struggling to make ends meet as they battle with extreme weather and rising costs.In May, Helen Browning, chief executive officer of the Soil Association, said during a media briefing by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank that farmers were considering walking away as they could make much more money doing something else. A record run of wet weather has left many in perilous financial situations, and an annual National Farmers' Union survey put farmers' confidence at the lowest since it began in 2010.Leasing land to solar developers gives farmers regular revenue for not much work, which could mean the difference between a farmer having to quit and being able to continue producing food. Speaking to the Financial Times, one Italian farmer described solar panels as \"a gift from the heavens.\" About 25 per cent of designated farmland in Italy is lying fallow thanks to extreme heat, drought and rising costs. When growing food is simply unviable, why block growers from finding new ways to make a sustainable income off it, as Meloni's new bill does? Some are also concerned about the effect of large solar farms on biodiversity, but again, these developments can be net positive for biodiversity. Research has shown that vulnerable species are happily coexisting with solar parks, and pollinating insects are thriving as grasses and wildflowers sprout up beneath and between panels. As a UBS Group AG report points out, those concerned about biodiversity ought to be more worried about the mining and production of materials used within solar panels, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of the natural capital impacts of a solar power facility's lifecycle. There is a brewing issue in the uneven distribution of solar parks: 43 per cent of ground-mounted installations are in the southwest and southeast of England, which is leading to fierce local opposition. Placing solar panels on brownfield sites, car parks and roofs should also be made much easier.But pitching solar power against food and biodiversity may do more harm than good to the agricultural sector and ignores a whole host of benefits to both the planet and people.",

            "articleBody": "Addressing the G7 Summit Outreach Session in Italy, PM Modi highlighted that India's approach in the energy transition was based on four principles of availability, accessibility, affordability and acceptability (https://bit.ly/3xm7N51). Country&rsquo;s target of Net Zero Emissions by 2070 necessitates decarbonization of its industrial sector, including MSMEs. Just to set the context, the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector contributes approximately 8 per cent of GHG emissions. Between 2010 and 2022, industrial energy consumption grew at an annual rate of 2 per cent in China, 4.5 per cent in India, and 0.7 per cent in the United States, while it fell by 0.8 per cent in the European Union and 1.4 per cent in Japan. The centrality of MSMEs can be gauged from the fact that MSMEs contribute about 30 per cent of India's GDP, are responsible for 45 per cent of India's total exports and one-third of India's manufacturing output; creating 120 million jobs in the process. As per some studies, Indian MSMEs generate 110 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. Not surprisingly, low carbon and sustainable growth of MSMEs is a key element of India&rsquo;s Long Term Low Carbon Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). A large number of MSMEs use energy primarily as motive power, predominantly in the form of electricity, making them ideal candidates for both, demand side as well as supply side clean energy interventions. An interesting fact brought out by IEA states that the electric motors have the highest potential of a single technology for reducing energy intensity of light industry processes. While the upper end of the spectrum of MSMEs i.e. the medium and small industries happen to be cognizant of benefits of employing energy-efficient motors; it is the micro industries that needs special attention. The same goes for clean energy supply such as through solar power. The main challenges remain that of knowledge asymmetry, access to the optimum equipment, and the resources to facilitate the transition. In other words, a combination of lack of ready access to technology up-gradation, demand aggregation, and relatively lower absorptive capacity add to already insurmountable odds micro units face to make decarbonization work. Let us reimagine this looking through the four lenses of availability, accessibility, affordability and acceptability. That means shifting focus from installation of energy-efficient motors or solar rooftop systems to supply of services: mutually agreed reduction in electricity consumption or supply of grid-quality electricity from solar systems. This would address the problem of the information-deficit, availability, as well as accessibility. Afterall, most of the common consumers of grid electricity do not have to understand the technicalities of power generation and transmission. In other words, a much greater role of ESCOs, RESCOs, and the demand aggregators. With easy availability of reliable IoT-based devices coupled with ML/AI; remote, real-time, and conflict-free monitoring is not an issue anymore. This also takes care of two other challenges in transitioning to new, low carbon technologies, namely (i) their upfront cost (while such interventions may be economically attractive on levelized costs basis, for the industry what matters is the initial investment and payback period) and (ii) the risk perception about new technologies. However, it still does not solve the issue of connecting the consumer to the service providers because if MSMEs are left to hunt for the reliable service providers, we are back to square one. With so many examples of tech-enabled platforms &ndash; e.g., ONDC, Amazon, OLA to name a few, it stands to reason that the similar platforms with curated groups of verified service providers on-board could provide the much-needed thrust to this transitional movement.But this recipe still requires an important ingredient without which the status quo may continue. And that important element is the financing as an enabler, helping the service providers meet end-consumers&rsquo; needs. So, the said platforms have to have financing partners like banks, NBFCS, and peer-to-peer lenders on-board too. For meeting the conventional financing needs of MSMEs, platforms like Lendingkart, Arthmate, Indifi Technologies, PSBLoansin59minutes, and SMEcorner already exist. What is required is to overlay clean energy service partners over them. What remains thereafter are the lending rates. For MSMEs, it is all about the opportunity cost of investment between their core businesses or clean energy initiatives. Unless, the proposed clean energy investments make an economic sense to MSMEs, merely rarified goals like climate change may not suffice.Unfortunately, emerging economies like India face higher borrowing costs, with the cost of capital for clean energy projects about 2-3 times higher than in advanced economies and China. As per IFC, MSMEs face a significant challenge in accessing credit, with only 16 per cent of the 64 million MSMEs able to secure financing through formal banking systems. Green financing through scheduled banks and NBFCs, backed by the likes of SIDBI, Ministry of MSMEs, GCF, and other international financial institutions could be the way out. Schemes like Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) may also help in bringing down cost of financing. While the affordability part is this taken care of, let us not forget `acceptability&rsquo; where the Industry Associations, CSOs and Think Tanks take the lead in sensitizing MSMEs about the appropriate technological solutions on one hand and the role of MSMEs in overall decarbonization journey of the country on the other hand. Naturally, the cleantech platforms would work in tandem with other actors in these mega awareness creation drives. Role is also cut out for the larger industries to facilitate transition of MSMEs down the supply chain because ultimately it helps them in meeting their ESG goals. `MSMEs for Viksit Bharat&rsquo; needs a tech-enabled approach to transit.

            "articleBody": "In today&rsquo;s world, Sustainability in business has evolved beyond the rudimentary principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle. As we navigate the complex environmental challenges of the 21st century, companies are recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and holistic approach. We attempt to delve into the transformative potential of embracing a circular economy, redefining product design, optimizing resource use, and fostering collaborative initiatives for a sustainable future. The conventional 3R model&mdash;reduce, reuse, recycle&mdash;has been the cornerstone of sustainability efforts for decades. While undeniably valuable, its limitations are increasingly apparent in the face of escalating environmental concerns. To truly make a substantial impact, businesses must move beyond this paradigm and adopt a holistic strategy that encompasses every facet of their operations.Circular Economy Principles: A Paradigm ShiftAt the forefront of this evolution is the adoption of circular economy principles. In 2024, companies are recognizing the imperative to redesign their production processes, to minimize waste and facilitate material recycling. The circular economy model promotes a closed-loop system, where products are designed with the end in mind, ensuring they can be easily repaired, refurbished, or recycled.A Swedish furniture giant is a prime example of how circular economy principles can be translated into tangible action. The firm is investing in sustainable materials, designing products for recyclability, and encouraging customers to recycle old furniture through its buy-back programs. Since its launch in 2005, it has diverted over 60,000 tons of furniture from landfills.Designing for Longevity and End-of-Life RepurposingCentral to this holistic approach is a shift in product design philosophy. Businesses are now focusing on creating products with longevity, thereby reducing the frequency of replacements and minimizing the overall environmental impact. By prioritizing durability and reparability, companies across industries are contributing to the extension of product lifecycles, curbing the incessant cycle of production and disposal. An American outdoor recreation clothing company offers a lifetime warranty on its products and encourages its customers to repair or return worn-out items through its Worn Wear program.Furthermore, end-of-life repurposing becomes a pivotal aspect of this approach. Products are designed with disassembly in mind, making it easier to extract and repurpose materials once the product reaches the end of its usable life. This shift not only reduces the burden on landfills but also contributes to the establishment of a more sustainable, closed-loop system.Optimizing Resource Use: Prioritizing Renewable Energy and Responsible SourcingA holistic sustainability approach necessitates a thorough examination of the entire production cycle. Companies are increasingly prioritizing renewable energy sources to power their operations, thereby reducing their carbon footprint. A leading British multinational FMCG has committed to making all its packaging reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025. This extends beyond the manufacturing floor to encompass the entire supply chain, reinforcing the commitment to environmentally friendly practices.Additionally, responsible sourcing of materials becomes a crucial component of this strategy. A German automotive OEM is scrutinizing its supply chains and implementing environmental and social standards throughout its supply chain. They use recycled materials and partner with suppliers who share their sustainability goals. By minimizing resource extraction and fostering responsible sourcing practices, businesses contribute to the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity.Supplier engagement becomes instrumental as the journey towards sustainability is not solitary. it requires collaboration across the entire value chain. Businesses are forging partnerships with suppliers as well as consumers to establish a closed-loop system for materials. This collaborative approach ensures that the entire value chain is aligned with the overarching goal of environmental conservation and resource efficiency and that stakeholders work beyond the linear 'take-make-dispose' model.Technological Innovation: 3D Printing and Sustainable MaterialsIn the pursuit of holistic sustainability, companies are harnessing the power of technological innovation. Advanced manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing, offer unprecedented opportunities to create products with minimal waste and energy consumption. An American aircraft engine supplier is exploring 3D printed jet engine brackets with internal lattice structures, achieving 20% weight reduction and improved heat transfer, translating to significant fuel savings and increased engine efficiency. This not only enhances production efficiency but also enables customization, reducing the need for mass production and its associated environmental costs.Moreover, there is a growing emphasis on the development and utilization of sustainable materials. A leading multinational athletic apparel firm&rsquo;s collaboration with a material solutions partner has resulted in innovative bio-fabricated materials made from mushrooms. These materials offer durability, breathability, and leather-like properties, minimizing reliance on animal products and fossil fuels. This not only addresses concerns about material disposal but also contributes to a broader shift towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly material palette.A Comprehensive Strategy for Environmental Conservation: The time for incremental change is over. In 2024, embracing a holistic sustainability strategy isn't just a laudable ambition; it's a competitive necessity. Businesses that weave circularity, responsible sourcing, collaboration, and innovation into the fabric of their operations will rise as leaders in a transformed landscape. To thrive in this new era, the choice is no longer between profit and the planet &ndash; it is the pursuit of both, together. The call to action is clear: redefine your approach, redefine your future.",

            "articleBody": "Representative imageNew Delhi: Adani group-owned Ambuja Cements on Thursday said its board has approved the merger of Adani Cementation, which is now a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises. After the approval of the Scheme of Amalgamation of Adani Cementation, after regulatory and shareholders approval, it would become a wholly-owned subsidiary. The merger is totally based on share swapping and Adani Enterprises will get 8.7 million shares of Ambuja Cements. The consolidation of cement capacities within Adani Group is \"to enhance operational efficiency\" and strengthen Ambuja Cements' coastal footprint. The scheme has a \"SWAP ratio of 174 shares of Ambuja Cements Ltd for every 1 share of Adani Cementation Ltd (ACL),\" it said. Adani Cementation Ltd is wholly owned by Adani Enterprise Ltd. This will help in a better synergy for Ambuja Cements as ACL's presence at strategic locations near Dahej port and Amba River - Raigad. It will enable source clinker by Sea as well as Rail to serve high growth market of South Gujarat and Mumbai. Besides \"ACL's limestone resource to further enhance Ambuja's consolidated limestone reserves,\" said a merger transaction brief shared by Ambuja to bourses. ACL has acquired land to set up 2.5 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) along with captive jetty at Amba River, Raigad (Maharashtra). Besides, it has commissioned 1.30 MTPA cement grinding capacity at Dahej, Gujarat in July 2023, where expansion is in progress for another 1.20 MTPA. The merger will also provide \"competitive advantage\" to Ambuja Cements to serve high growth market of South Gujarat by Dahej and Mumbai market by Raigad through sea logistics as well as rail, it added. Billionaire Gautam Adani-led company has an installed capacity of 79 MTPA. The growth-hungry group has an ambition to have a capacity of 140 MTPA by 2028. Earlier this month, it announced the acquisition of Hyderabad-based Penna Cement at an enterprise value of Rs 10,422 crore this month, which will add 14 MTPA, taking its capacity to 93 MTPA. The Adani group in last December completed the acquisition of Saurastra-based Sanghi Industries Ltd, at an enterprise value of Rs 5,185 crore. Adani Group entered into the cement sector in September 2022, after acquiring controlling stakes in Ambuja Cement from Swiss firm Holcim for cash proceeds of USD 6.4 billion (about Rs 51,000 crore). Ambuja Cements owns a 51 per cent stake in ACC Ltd. Later it also launched a Rs 31,000 crore open offer for the acquisition of 26 per cent additional stakes from public shareholders. According to data from the Cement Manufacturers Association, the country has installed a cement capacity of 541 Metric Tonnes (MT).

Deputy Managing Director of SIDBI, Sudatta Mandal, said it has taken proactive steps to make the MSME eco-system \"green\" with several financial and non-financial engagements. Speaking at an interactive session on the occasion of International MSME Day organised by the MCCI, Mandal said SIDBI has launched various lending products on competitive terms to facilitate energy-efficient transition of the MSMEs. \"In the green space, SIDBI has piloted several projects and validated models such as Partial Risk Sharing Facility for energy efficiency programme supported by the World Bank with a corpus of USD 37 million,\" he said. Mandal said SIDBI has made continuous efforts for holistic development of the MSME sector, which now contributes to 45 per cent of India's exports and close to 30 per cent of the country's GDP. The official also said the financial institution is helping the MSMEs to assess the energy efficiency of business processes, and adopt low-emission pathways. Mandal urged the sector to take advantage of schemes for technology upgradation, promoting innovation and credit-linked capital subsidies to grow in a sustainable manner. Projects of 176 MSMEs covering investments worth Rs 3.20 lakh crore have been approved under the PLI (production linked incentive) schemes of the Centre, he added.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Central Railway has installed a floating solar plant of 10 MWp capacity in the Igatpuri lake located in the Western Ghats, a first-of-its-kind initiative by the Indian Railways, senior officials said. According to the Central Railway officials, the plant is committed to leveraging renewable energy sources, utilising solar power, installing wind-energy resources, providing adequate passenger amenities and contributing significantly towards the railways' goal of a \"green Earth\". Besides, the officials said moving towards its ultimate goal of zero carbon emission by 2030, the Central Railway has commissioned 12.05-MWp solar plants by utilising the rooftop of railway stations and buildings, out of which, 4-MWp solar plants were provided last year. \"MWp stands for Megawatt Peak, which is a measure of the maximum potential output of power. This has resulted in a saving of Rs 4.62 crore in 2023-24 and a saving of carbon footprints of 6,594.81 MT. There are further plans to install an additional 7-MWp solar plant in the current year,\" a senior Central Railway official said. \"Steps have also been taken to move towards renewable energy. At present, 56.4 MW of wind energy and 61 MW of solar energy are being tapped,\" he added. According to the Central Railway, agreements have been signed for the utilisation of 325 MW of solar and wind energy, which will be on the \"round-the-clock\" basis. Besides this, 180 MW of solar and 50 MW of wind power is also likely to flow in the current financial year, officials said. \"These initiatives are equivalent to saving 2.5 lakh trees, which means the benefits provided by these measures are equal to that of the benefits provided by 2.5 lakh trees,\" another senior railway official said.  The Central Railway maintains that its present monthly power consumption is 236.92 million units for traction work and 9.7 million units for non-traction work. \"After the commissioning of the above sources of renewable energy, it is expected that 70 per cent of the traction energy will be green,\" the official said. He added that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency has awarded the \"Shunya-Plus\" label to five buildings and \"Shunya\" label to two buildings of the Central Railway as on date. \"In an effort to encourage the building owners and promoters to make energy-efficient buildings and further making improvements to make net-zero or net-positive energy buildings, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency has introduced a labelling programme called Shunya for Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) and Shunya Plus for Net Positive Energy Buildings (NPEBs). The awarding of these levels shows the dedicated efforts put in by the Central Railway towards the conservation of environment,\" the official said.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: NITI Aayog&rsquo;s VK Saraswat said that India&rsquo;s per capita greenhouse gas emissions are significantly below the global average at 2.9 tons of CO2 equivalent, underscoring the nation&rsquo;s minor role in global emissions. Speaking at the ETEnergyworld India Net Zero Forum, he contrasted India&rsquo;s emissions with those of the G20 nations, which account for 75 per cent of global emissions as of 2020, emphasizing the skewed contribution of developed countries to global warming despite India's large population.During his presentation, Saraswat pointed out that while the G20 nations accounted for 75 per cent of global emissions in 2020, India&rsquo;s historical contribution from 1850 to 2021 is less than 4 per cent. This data emphasizes India's relatively minor role in historical global emissions despite being one of the most populous nations.Saraswat also addressed India&rsquo;s energy mix, which is currently dominated by fossil fuels, accounting for about 84 per cent of the country&rsquo;s total energy consumption. The remainder comes from renewables and nuclear power. He stressed the importance of transitioning towards more sustainable energy sources to meet the increasing energy demand responsibly.The NITI Aayog official also discussed the National Green Hydrogen Mission, aiming to produce 5 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2034 with an investment of &#8377;19,700 crore. This mission is part of a broader strategy to make India a leader in hydrogen energy, focusing on technological advancements to reduce costs and enhance the efficiency of electrolyzer technologies.Saraswat called for strong policy frameworks and increased investment in sustainable energy technologies to accelerate India&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy. He reiterated India's commitment to achieving its net zero emissions by 2070, advocating for international collaboration to address global climate challenges effectively.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The demand for copper, a key component in electric vehicles, will go up substantially as the world shifts to cleaner energy sources to mitigate climate change, according to Hindustan Copper Chairman and Managing Director Ghanshyam Sharma. By transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced significantly.  \"As the world transitions to cleaner energy sources...the demand for copper will increase significantly as a vital component in electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines etc,\" the CMD said in a recent message on the company's website.  He further said the company has been given the charge of utilisation of the nation's copper resources in an efficient and sustainable way.  India, he said, is committed to achieving net zero emission by 2070.  According to ICRA, the domestic refined copper demand growth is expected to remain healthy at 11 per cent in FY25, outpacing the rate of global growth in copper demand, given the Centre's thrust on infrastructure development and a gradual transition to renewable energy.  In the domestic market, around 40 per cent of the copper is consumed by infrastructure and construction sector and 11-13 per cent each in the automobile and consumer durables sectors.  The Centre's emphasis on affordable housing schemes, smart city projects, the defence sector as well as the expected higher penetration of EVs and its associated infrastructure bode well for the domestic copper demand outlook.  Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) was the sole producer of refined copper till 1995. Currently, three major players dominate the Indian copper industry namely HCL in public sector, Hindalco Industries Ltd and Vedanta in the private sector.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Tariffs for various energy segments in India differ significantly, with offshore wind energy being the most expensive, according to CRISIL. For fiscal year 2024, solar energy tariffs are at Rs 2.6/kWh, wind at Rs 3.4/kWh, hybrid at Rs 4.1/kWh, and offshore wind expected at Rs 6-6.5/kWh. This disparity underscores the cost challenges faced by offshore wind projects due to enhanced requirements such as high-maintenance outer steel layers, underwater transmission networks, and additional port infrastructure.The Union Cabinet's recent approval of a viability gap funding (VGF) scheme, with a total allocation of Rs 7,453 crore, aims to support these costly offshore wind energy projects. The VGF scheme allocates Rs 6,853 crore for the installation and commissioning of 1 GW of offshore wind energy projects off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Additionally, Rs 600 crore will be used to upgrade two ports to meet the logistical needs of these projects, supported by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, to handle the storage and movement of heavy and large-dimension equipment.Sehul Bhatt, Director at CRISIL MI&amp;A Research, stated that the 1 GW of offshore capacity supported by the VGF is expected to be operational by fiscal 2032, contributing about 0.9 per cent to India's overall wind capacity. The capital expenditure for offshore wind projects is projected at Rs 18,000-20,000 crore by fiscal 2032, with the VGF covering approximately 36 per cent of the total project cost.Surbhi Kaushal, Associate Director at CRISIL MI&amp;A Research, mentioned that government support and subsidies during the construction stage could reduce tariffs by 28-30 per cent compared to a no-subsidy scenario, bringing them to Rs 6-6.5/kWh. Despite this reduction, offshore wind tariffs remain significantly higher than onshore wind tariffs, which are Rs 3.3-3.4/kWh. The attractiveness of offshore wind lies in its ability to provide a high plant load factor (PLF) consistently, addressing issues related to land inadequacy and physical barriers that affect wind flow on land.Despite the support, the offshore wind energy sector in India is still in its early stages and faces structural execution challenges. Advanced technological expertise and the development of turbine sizes between 5-10 MW for offshore projects are needed. China, which faced similar challenges in installing offshore wind projects in 2010, provided funding support through subsidies up to 48 per cent of project costs in 2017, leading to a capacity addition of around 4.1 GW between 2014 and 2018. China currently leads the segment with a 30 per cent global share.Tariffs for offshore wind are expected to remain high compared to other fuel sources in the long term, with potential reductions post-fiscal 2030 due to economies of scale and value chain development.Private sector participation and offtake from distribution companies at elevated tariffs will be closely monitored.",

            "articleBody": "Washington: As he campaigned for the presidency, Joe Biden promised to spend billions of dollars to \"save the world\" from climate change. One of the largest players in the solar industry was ready. Officials, board members and major investors in First Solar, the largest domestic maker of solar panels, donated at least $1.5 million to Biden's successful 2020 bid for the White House. After he won, the company spent $2.8 million more lobbying his administration and Congress, records show - an effort that included high-level meetings with top administration officials. The strategy was a dramatic departure from the Arizona-based company's posture under then-President Donald Trump, whom corporate officials publicly called out as hostile toward renewable energy. It has also paid massive dividends as First Solar became perhaps the biggest beneficiary from $1 trillion in environmental spending enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022 after it cleared Congress solely with Democratic votes. Since then, First Solar's stock price has doubled and its profits have soared thanks to new federal subsidies that could be worth up to $10 billion over a decade. The success has delivered a massive windfall to a small group of Democratic donors who invested heavily in the company. Ahead of what's shaping up to be a tight race for the White House this year, Biden and fellow Democrats point to the legislation as an example of investing in alternative energy in ways that'll help the environment and lift the economy. But First Solar offers an example of how that legislation, shaped by lobbyists and potentially influenced by a flood of campaign cash, can yield mammoth returns to the well-connected. Angelo Fernandez Hernandez, a White House spokesperson, didn't directly address First Solar's efforts to curry favor with the Biden administration. \"President Biden has led and delivered on the most ambitious climate agenda in history,\" Fernandez Hernandez said in a statement. \"The White House regularly engages with industry leaders across all sectors, including clean energy manufacturers and gas and oil producers.\" In a statement, First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said the new subsidies have helped build the company's domestic footprint. He took a swipe at some of First Solar's rivals with ties to China, which dominates the industry. \"Unlike others who routinely spend substantially more lobbying on behalf of Chinese companies that circumvent US laws and deepen strategic vulnerabilities, our interests lie in a diverse, competitive domestic solar manufacturing base supporting American jobs, economic value, and energy security,\" Widmar said. Founded in 1999, First Solar went public in 2006, the year former Vice President Al Gore's movie \"An Inconvenient Truth\" helped raise consciousness about the threat of climate change. Company officials cultivated a constituency with Democrats during President Barack Obama's administration, which in turn subsidized them through billions of dollars in government-backed loans. When the Biden administration started writing rules to implement the Democrats' new law, First Solar executives and lobbyists met at least four times in late 2022 and 2023 with administration officials, including John Podesta, who oversaw the measure's environmental provisions. One of the more intimate gatherings was attended by Podesta, Widmar and Sloan, as well as First Solar's contract lobbyist, Claudia James, a friend of Podesta's who worked for decades at a lobbying firm run by Podesta's brother, records show. The company will benefit from billions of dollars in lucrative tax credits for domestic clean energy manufacturers - a policy aimed at putting the U.S. on a more competitive footing with green energy giant China. Though intended to reward clean-energy businesses, the credits can be sold on the open market to companies that have little to do with fighting climate change. Last December, First Solar agreed to sell roughly $650 million of these credits to a tech company - providing a massive influx of cash, courtesy of the U.S. government. Investors in the company, including a handful of major Democratic donors, have also benefited as First Solar's share price climbed. Farhad \"Fred\" Ebrahimi was added to Forbes billionaires list in 2023 thanks to the skyrocketing value of his roughly 5% stake in First Solar, financial disclosures show. Ebrahimi, along with his wife and family, contributed at least $1 million to Biden's election effort, according to campaign finance disclosures. Democrats' investments in alternative energy companies haven't always panned out. The 2011 bankruptcy of Solyndra, which had received $500 million in government-backed loans, became a rallying cry for Republicans. It also drew a spotlight to First Solar, whose chairman was called to testify before the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee, where he was grilled about strong-arm tactics used to secure $2.4 billion in loans from the Obama administration for projects First Solar was involved in. In an email turned over to House Republicans, a First Solar executive pressured the Department of Energy for the financing, suggesting that if it weren't approved, a Mesa, Arizona, factory Obama administration officials were eager to tout may not be built. \"A failure to receive DOE and U.S. government agency approvals\" could \"jeopardize construction\" and \"frankly, undermine the rationale for a new manufacturing center in Arizona,\" a former executive wrote to an administration official in 2011. The loans were granted. The factory, however, was never completed. (AP) ZH ZH",

            "articleBody": "BRUSSELS: The European Union will set out how its member countries should jointly develop major renewable energy projects, in a bid to avoid projects being delayed by disputes over splitting the bill, a document seen by Reuters showed. As Europe's shift to low-carbon energy gathers pace, countries are planning major new wind farms and other off-shore energy projects that will link to multiple nations. How governments and companies in these countries split the bill for such projects is an open question, and Brussels is concerned that disputes over who should pay could hamper the build-out of these major new green energy hubs. \"We don't underestimate the potential for conflicts, disputes and delay in projects of this complexity,\" a senior EU official said. Draft European Commission guidelines, due to be published this week and seen by Reuters, will provide a basis for governments to negotiate deals on these major offshore renewable energy projects. For example, countries should consider skimming off a share of these congestion revenues and putting the cash in a und that could invest in future renewable energy projects benefiting multiple countries in the region, the draft said. Such a scheme \"would address investment gaps persistently difficult to fill\", for major cross-border energy projects, the draft said. Other ways to cover financing gaps could include \"statistical transfer\" deals in which one country invests in a renewable project in another country, in exchange for receiving credits that the investing country can count towards meeting its renewable energy goals, the draft said. Belgium and France are currently at odds over a major new wind farm planned off the coast of Dunkirk, which Belgium wants moved to a different site. Countries could also explore new ways to jointly own such projects, including by launching new offshore power transmission entities to develop offshore power grid projects linked to multiple countries, the draft said. It also urged countries to decide early how to share congestion income that a project will eventually generate - and consider splitting this based not only on the split in ownership of the project, but also the cost of operating it.

            "articleBody": "Vatican City: Pope Francis has ordered the Vatican to install a solar plant that will provide electricity to the entire city state, as the pontiff does his bit to tackle climate change.Francis, a longtime advocate of environmental protection, issued an official letter published Wednesday demanding the establishment of an \"agrivoltaic\" plant in Santa Maria di Galeria, an extraterritorial area of Vatican land north of Rome.Agrivoltaic projects combine solar energy production and agriculture, with panels commonly installed above fields of crops or pasture land.\"We must make a transition towards a model of sustainable development that reduces greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, to achieve the objective of climate neutrality,\" the pope wrote in the letter, dated June 21.He said the plant would produce enough energy to power not only the Vatican Radio transmission centre already located on the site, but also ensure \"the complete energy sustenance of the Vatican City State\".The letter did not specify when the plant would be installed or become operational.Francis said he intended \"to contribute to the efforts by all states to offer, in accordance with their respective responsibilities and capabilities, an adequate response to the challenges posed to humanity and our common home by climate change\".In 2022, the Vatican joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris climate accords, which in 2015 set the target of limiting the world to a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels.Pope Benedict XVI kicked off the Vatican's green initiatives in 2008 by installing solar panels on its audience hall. But it has been Francis, 87, who has lambasted human-caused climate change and the fact that the world's most marginalised are paying the highest price for global warming.Last year, the Vatican issued its first nationally determined contribution (NDC) -- efforts to reduce emissions under the Paris accords -- in which it pledged to reduce greenhouse gases to 20 percent below 2011 level by 2030.Francis has also drawn up an \"Ecological Conversion 2030\" plan for carbon-neutral projects and technologies, including switching to electric vehicles, though the city state's contribution to global emissions is already negligible.",

The cutbacks were the result of a strategy review announced last month by recently appointed Statkraft CEO Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal as profits fell and geopolitical uncertainty increased. \"Market conditions for the entire renewable energy industry have become more challenging,\" Ringstad Vartdal said in a statement, adding that the company would allocate capital to its most value-creating opportunities with the best strategic fit. Statkraft will prioritise its core hydropower and market operations businesses, while scaling back investment plans in wind and solar energy. The group now plans annual development of 2-2.5 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity from solar, onshore wind and battery storage annually from 2026, down from a previous goal of adding 2.5-3 GW per year from 2025 and 4 GW from 2030. Its investment in offshore wind will see the development of 6-8 GW of capacity by 2040, down from a previous goal of 10 GW, the company said. ",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Four decades ago, a rare earth processing plant on France's Atlantic coast was one of the largest in the world, churning out materials used to make colour televisions, arc lights and camera lenses. Its current owner Solvay is racing to return the plant at La Rochelle to its former glory after years of diminished output as Europe seeks to boost production of the minerals fuelling the green energy transition. The factory's 76-year history is a microcosm of the challenges Europe and the United States face as they seek to reverse massive migration of rare earth processing to China that took place around 25 years ago.  China became dominant in rare earths, a group of 17 minerals, by producing them at lower prices than the West, helped by government support, and often ignoring environmental concerns in a sector that can create toxic waste. In recent years, China has beefed up sustainability and closed polluting operations. In the 1980s and 1990s, output from the plant at La Rochelle set the benchmark for global rare earth prices. It now supplies 4,000 metric tons a year of separated rare earth oxides, a fraction of the 298,000 tons pumped out by China last year. Moreover, Solvay's modest output is focused on the kind of processed rare earths used for auto catalysts and electronics, not the kind needed for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles (EVs) and wind energy. Solvay says it will start producing those by next year. \"We at Solvay want to put rare earths for permanent magnets back on the map in Europe,\" said An Nuyttens, president of Solvay's division that produces rare earth products. \"It's not an easy one, it's going to be step by step, as the chain from mining up to magnets production needs to be built.\" Eventually, the 160-year-old chemicals group aims to supply 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the separated rare earths demand for magnet production in Europe, but Nuyttens said meeting that target may not be possible until after 2030, giving no date. Under a new EU law that entered into force in May, the bloc has set ambitious 2030 targets for domestic production of critical minerals required for its green transition - 10 per cent of annual needs mined, 25 per cent recycled and 40 per cent processed domestically by the end of the decade.The bloc has zeroed in on rare earths as one of the most important critical minerals due to their use in permanent magnets that power motors in EVs and wind energy. EU demand is forecast to soar sixfold in the decade to 2030 and sevenfold by 2050. The EU will struggle, however, to meet most of the goals in rare earths, according to production forecasts gathered by Reuters and interviews with over a dozen industry executives, consultants, EU-funded officials, industry groups and investors. Missing targets in the Critical Raw Material Act (CRMA) may impact the bloc's zero carbon goals while opening the prospect of further dependence on China amid heightened geopolitical tension with the West, analysts say. China accounts for 98 per cent of EU rare earth permanent magnet imports. EU Commission spokesperson Johanna Bernsel said they could not confirm the Reuters findings, but said the bloc would do its best to promote projects that help meet the goals in the CRMA. \"Projects in Europe will benefit from a streamlined permitting process, as well as coordinated support for accessing de-risking financing tools and matchmaking with downstream users,\" Bernsel said.   WINDOW CLOSING FAST      There are three main steps in the rare earth supply chain before permanent magnets can be produced -- mining, separating elements and producing metals/alloys (the latter two both come under the processing target). Reuters compiled production forecasts from companies and compared those with a demand forecast in a report by two EU-funded bodies to assess how the bloc is faring compared to its goals.      According to the Reuters analysis, the EU is due to have only scant output from rare earth mines by 2030; and there is similarly only one project in the metals and alloys sector, which is low margin.        The bloc, however, is likely to meet one target in its most advanced area, separation, producing 45 per cent of needs by 2030.           The final stage of the supply chain - producing magnets from the metals - is not covered by the targets in the new law since they are a finished product, but EU output is expected to meet only 22 per cent of expected demand by 2030, according to the Reuters analysis.         Obstacles to boosting EU rare earths output include public opposition to new mines, wary support by European industry which benefits from cheap Chinese imports, limited funding, uncertain demand as EV sales growth falters and weak prices for the metals.          \"The window between now and 2030 is going to close very quickly in the context of how long it takes to get some of these projects and processing facilities off the ground,\" said Ryan Castilloux at consultancy Adamas Intelligence, which specialises in critical minerals.     Failing to include magnets in the CRMA targets is a \"blindspot\" and sets up the law to generate \"false-positive\" results, he added. The EU spokesperson did not comment directly on that criticism, but noted that CRMA includes several measures to increase recycling.     MINING ON ICE     The European continent has rich rare earth deposits, but there is currently no mining of them. That is unlikely to change in the near term with some projects stalled due to public opposition. The only likely output in the EU by 2030 is re-processing waste from Sweden's LKAB iron ore mines, which would contribute about 1 per cent of the EU's demand for oxides needed for magnets, based on the Reuters analysis. Southern Sweden's Norra Karr project, which could supply a large portion of the region's demand, has been held up for 10 years in the government's permitting process and there has also been opposition by environmentalists who say it could pollute drinking water. An executive of the project's owner, Leading Edge Materials, said a new application for a mining lease is underway for a redesigned project, but offered no timeline for starting production. The Swedish government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company plans to apply for the project to be declared strategic under the CRMA, which in theory would make possible fast-track permitting in 27 months. Another rare earths mining project, Sokli in Finland, also aims to be named a strategic project, but it still has to go through environmental impact assessment and permitting. \"It's not realistic to have it commissioned before 2030,\" said Matti Hietanen, CEO of the project's owner, state-owned Finnish Minerals Group. Non-EU-member Norway could contribute 10 per cent of the bloc's demand by 2031, according to private company Rare Earths Norway, which said this month it has Europe's biggest rare earth deposit. A slide in rare earth prices is also dampening prospects for new mining projects. \"At current price levels, most mines are just not profitable, so there must be support from governments and automakers,\" said Daan De Jonge at consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence in London. EU companies are also gearing up to take advantage of the huge potential for recycling to supply critical rare earths, but it will take time before there is enough supply of old EVs and wind turbines to process. INTEGRATING THE SUPPLY CHAIN Other industry executives echoed Solvay's uncertainty about ramping up output by 2030, with several telling Reuters they could not commit to launching or raising production by then. Some of the wariness is due to sales demand for electric cars cooling in recent months after rising dramatically for several years, as consumers wait for more affordable models to hit the market. European EV sales fell 9 per cent in May. Another challenge for Europe is competing with cheaper imports from China, which has a highly integrated rare earths supply chain including state-owned firms from mining to finished magnets.  Some of the key European rare earth firms have long had operations in China or joint ventures with firms there and are using that expertise to help boost their new EU ventures.One of those is Neo Performance Materials. It has a plant for separating rare earths in Estonia plus operations in other countries including China. It is also building a permanent magnet factory in Estonia, which is due to launch output next year and ramp up to 2,000 tons annual capacity over the following two to three years, enough magnets to power about 1.5 million EVs. Expansion will depend on whether customers support the Critical Raw Material Act targets. \"If they're going to buy 40 per cent of their processed material here, we will absolutely support that demand with production capabilities in Europe,\" said CEO Rahim Suleman. While competing with China is tough, Neo estimates it can produce magnets that would cost about $50 per vehicle more than imported magnets from China. The permanent magnets in hybrid and EV motors cost more than $300 per vehicle or up to half the cost of the motor, analysts say. GKN Powder Metallurgy has launched small-scale production of permanent magnets at a plant in Germany and is gearing up to build a larger commercial facility based on demand. Magneti Ljubljana in Slovenia, founded in 1951, aims to expand output, but this depends on customers agreeing to purchase products that are more expensive than Chinese imports to diversify their supply and in some cases boost sustainability. \"I've been working in this factory since 1986 and during that time, 27 factories in Europe closed down the production of magnets because of the price,\" Managing Director Albert Erman said.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: BP's new CEO Murray Auchincloss has imposed a hiring freeze and paused new offshore wind projects as he places a renewed emphasis on oil and gas amid investor discontent over its energy transition strategy, sources at the company said. The moves, which have not previously been reported, are part of a decision by Auchincloss to slow down investments in big budget, low-carbon projects, particularly in offshore wind, that are not expected to generate cash for years, said several sources at BP who declined to be named. They mark a stark reversal from the direction the CEO's predecessor Bernard Looney took to rapidly move away from fossil fuels. This has weighed on BP's shares as returns from renewables shrank, while profits from oil and gas soared in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. BP has reassigned dozens of people tasked with identifying new renewables opportunities to projects already underway such as offshore wind in Britain and Germany, three sources said. Auchincloss and Chief Financial Officer Kate Thomson have prioritised investing in and even acquiring new oil and gas assets, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and in the U.S. onshore shale basins, where BP already has large operations, company sources briefed on the matter said. BP will also consider investing in biofuels and some low-carbon businesses that can generate returns in the short term. Earlier this week, BP agreed to buy grain trader Bunge's 50% stake in Brazilian sugar and ethanol joint venture BP Bunge Bioenergia for $1.4 billion It is also expected to make some job cuts in renewables, although no specific targets have been given, the sources said, adding that BP has imposed a company-wide hiring freeze, with only a few exceptions including frontline and safety personnel. Auchincloss has promised a pragmatic approach since taking over in January, four months after Looney resigned for failing to disclose relationships with employees. In May Auchincloss announced a $2 billion cost saving drive by the end of 2026 relative to 2023. The 53-year-old also cut his executive leadership team from 11 to 10 members. BP said in a statement to Reuters that Auchincloss introduced six priorities \"to deliver as a simpler, more focused and higher value company\". The priorities include focusing the business and delivering \"the next wave of efficiencies and BP's growth projects\". \"The actions we are taking are part of delivering this - and of course are all in service of our aim of growing the value of BP,\" it said. BP's most high profile external hire under Looney was Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, a former head of RWE Renewables who joined in 2022 to lead its renewables and gas division but stepped down for personal reasons in April. Her successor, veteran BP executive William Lin, is expected to put a greater focus on gas operations when he takes over in the coming months, two sources said. Shares in BP have underperformed rivals in recent months, raising speculation that it could be a takeover target. That has piled pressure on Auchincloss as he seeks to reassure investors who are juggling the need to decarbonise the global economy with rising near-term demand for fossil fuels. BP spent $2.5 billion on renewables, hydrogen, EV charging and biofuels in 2023, out of a total capex of $16 billion.   BACK TO BLACK BP is the only major oil company to have oil and gas output reduction targets. Shell last year shifted its strategy to focus on high-return business, scaling back investments in many renewables and low-carbon energy businesses. In February 2023, BP slowed its cornerstone pledge to cut oil and gas output between 2019 and 2030 from 40% to 25%. It kept its 2030 renewables targets, including the development of 10 gigwatt of installed capacity. Auchincloss last month further softened the language on the 2030 target. In another sign of change, BP has hired several new staff to its exploration team, headed by Bryan Ritchie since May, as it tries to replenish its reserves in order to sustain and even grow output. BP is also allocating more capital and workforce to developing new fields such as the Kaskida, Tiber and Gila discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico. In recent weeks it also overhauled its mergers and acquisitions division by combining it with the business development division under Sam Skerry, three sources said. Last October BP said it had 18 billion of barrels of oil and gas equivalent in resources which represent 20 years of its current production that could be developed to sustain its 2022 production level within its returns target.",

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: Greenko Group is in talks with state-run power financier REC to raise funds for its green hydrogen and green ammonia project of 600 MW capacity, said two people close to the development. Greenko is looking to secure &#8377;2,200-2,400 crore from REC. Upon achieving financial closure, the company will enter into firm and definitive agreements with the lender, one of the persons said. The project has an offtake agreement with Norway's Yara and received pre-certification for ammonia. An offtake agreement is a contract to buy or sell goods in advance of production, which will facilitate financing for the project. Greenko has signed a term sheet with Yara Clean Ammonia in May this year, the trader and distributor of ammonia, for the supply of renewable ammonia from Phase 1 of AM Green's ammonia production facility in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh.The borrowing would be made under AM Green, incorporated by Greenko founders Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli, which is setting up India's first green hydrogen, green ammonia project. The lending is to support the project's long-term supply agreement with Yara, the second person said. The tie-up with Yara is for up to half of renewable ammonia from phase I of AM Green's 1 MT a year production facility in Kakinada, as reported by ET earlier. REC had lent &#8377;4,000 crore to ACME Group for its green hydrogen and green ammonia project in Oman. ",

This method utilizes commercially available nickel catalysts without the need for bases or activators, showing remarkable efficiency.The study, led by Prof. Ekambaram Balaraman, highlighted the method's effectiveness in the transfer of hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes, which is crucial for generating bioactive molecules with enhanced synthetic value. This innovative approach aligns with global efforts to find sustainable and renewable energy sources as the rapid depletion of fossil fuels continues.Methanol and paraformaldehyde, chosen for their abundant production and potential as hydrogen carriers, offer significant advantages over free hydrogen in terms of storage and transportation. The hydrogen produced was successfully employed in chemo- and stereo-selective partial transfer hydrogenations.Supported by ANRF (erstwhile SERB, a statutory body of the Department of Science and Technology), the research has been accepted for publication in the journal 'Catalysis Science &amp; Technology'. It presents a new avenue for COx-free hydrogen generation, contributing to the development of a 'Hydrogen economy' and addressing the challenges of increasing global energy demands.",

The Mumbai-based green energy firm aims to advance green hydrogen and its various derivatives as a key component of its integrated energy transition strategy.&ldquo;Our first major project, with a capacity of 0.5 MTPA, is already under implementation at Gopalpur Port in Odisha,&rdquo; he said. The company, which has an operational capacity of 4.5 GW at present, is also ramping up its execution capabilities to commission 4 GW renewable energy capacity per year, he added.&ldquo;Currently, we have an operational capacity of about 4.5 GW. Additionally, we have secured a capacity of about 18 GW and we are ramping up our execution capabilities to commission about 4 GW per year capacity, which positions us well to achieve our long-term goals,&rdquo; said Mittal.He said that this steady annual addition is part of the company&rsquo;s strategic plan to accelerate the energy transition journey.The company has set ambitious targets to expand its renewable energy capacity. By 2030, it aims to achieve a total installed capacity of 30 GW. On policy expectations from the government and also in light of the upcoming Budget, Mittal said that the government should mandate a quota for the use of green hydrogen and its various derivatives in sectors such as fertilizers, chemicals, steel, etc. &ldquo;The government should also consider implementing a nationwide policy mandating the use of green M15 fuel, which means mixing 15 per cent green methanol with petrol, in transportation and other applicable sectors, supported by incentives for producers and consumers to adopt this fuel,&rdquo; he said.He added that initially, GST should be kept nil on green hydrogen and its derivatives, whereas 5 per cent GST should be reinstated on solar power generating system and its related components.According to Mittal, just like renewable energy generation projects, an equitable interest rate should be levied for solar module manufacturing projects as currently these projects bear an additional interest of 50 bps.&ldquo;Green hydrogen and its derivatives should be included in the harmonised list of infrastructure sub-sectors as these sectors have the capability to transform the country into a net energy exporter,&rdquo; he added.He said that customs duty should be exempted for importing technologies, equipment for production of renewable power, manufacturing of green hydrogen and its derivatives such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, compressors and other imported components until adequate manufacturing capacity is established in the country.",

            "articleBody": "Bengaluru: Sembcorp's India unit has filed a suit in a Bengaluru court to stop Siemens Gamesa from selling country business before settling an arbitration arising from alleged default in executing a contract. In its filing before the Principal City Civil and Sessions Judge at Bengaluru, Sembcorp sought injunction over sale of the India assets of Siemens Gamesa, including its shareholding.  The court issued notices to Siemens Gamesa, court documents showed.  Sembcorp's India arm has filed a suit against Siemens Gamesa and its parent entity, Siemens Energy AG.  Siemens Energy AG has reportedly put its India subsidiary Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy's entire India manufacturing, maintenance and services business in renewables up for sale. This is effectively seen as a country exit for Siemens Gamesa.  Considering these material events and information, which lead to reasonable apprehension regarding the continued operation of the Siemens Gamesa as a going concern, Sembcorp filed an injunction petition against this stake sale.  Last year, the Singapore conglomerate's India arm dragged Siemens Gamesa to arbitration over a dispute over a wind power project.  Sembcorp's indirect Indian wholly owned subsidiary, Green Infra Wind Energy Limited (GIWEL) had contracted Siemens Gamesa to supply, erect and commission a 300-megawatt wind power project consisting of 143 wind turbine generators and associated transmission facilities.  The vendors allegedly defaulted on the contract, leading to GIWEL terminating the contract and filing a Rs 816 crore claim against Siemens Gamesa.  Siemens Gamesa filed a counterclaim seeking Rs 1957 crore from GIWEL.  GIWEL owns and operates 727.70 MW of wind-based power projects spread across seven locations in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Its subsidiary Green Infra Renewable Energy Limited also operates a 249.9-MW wind power project in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: California has been the dominant force behind the build-out of utility-scale battery storage systems in the United States, adding just over half of the country's total battery capacity since 2019, data from energy data portal Cleanview shows. California's 8.6 gigawatts (GW) of battery storage capacity accounts for roughly half of all utility-scale battery capacity within the US and is twice as much as the capacity in place in Texas, the second-largest deployer of battery storage. Total battery storage capacity in the US is currently estimated at around 17.5 GW, according to the US Energy Information Administration and Cleanview. But that total could jump beyond 30 GW by the end of the year \"if developers bring all of the energy storage systems they have planned on line by their intended commercial operation dates,\" according to the EIA.  GROWING SHARE Such a rapid rise in battery storage capacity will allow power system managers to store increasing volumes of excess power generated by solar and wind farms, and then discharge that surplus power to consumers once renewable generation declines. Power producers in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the state's power system, already use battery storage to supply as much as 20% of the system's electricity during peak consumption periods, data from gridstatus.io shows. For some periods during the CAISO system demand peak in early evening, batteries can be the largest single source of electricity, surpassing the volumes generated by hydro dams, nuclear reactors and natural gas plants. Such a high utilisation of batteries to manage system generation flows has important consequences both locally and nationally. Within CAISO, growing battery capacity has allowed system managers to store increasing volumes of surplus power generated by California's solar farms during the middle of the day, when system demand is usually at its lowest. By diverting some of that surplus power into batteries rather than onto the grid, CAISO managers can alleviate the so-called Duck Curve effect on prices which tend to swoop sharply lower when solar output peaks and then rise in the evening. As CAISO's solar capacity has outpaced the growth in battery capacity, CAISO power prices still undergo regular periods of weakness during sunny periods. But as more battery capacity is added to the system, battery storage should be able to limit the pressure on prices and help the CAISO managers improve system balances through the day.  NATIONAL GUIDE CAISO's growing battery capacity and resulting expertise in storage utilisation will also help power system managers elsewhere in the United States. Solar capacity has outpaced the supply growth of all other power forms in most major US power systems in recent years, and many system managers are grappling with the issue of generating too much solar capacity during sunny periods, and not enough clean power during other times of the day. Batteries can help solve that mismatch by storing growing quantities of surplus power for later use, by effectively shifting some of that surplus output from low-demand periods to times when consumer demand is highest. Batteries can also ensure that overall system generation mixes can continue to get cleaner by allowing producers to phase out outdated fossil-fuel plants and continue to expand the footprint of renewable and other clean energy assets.By Gavin Maguire",

            "articleBody": "An anti-green backlash in 2024&rsquo;s global election-supercycle is already taking a toll on environmental, social and governance-focused assets, with an ultimate test still to come in the US presidential vote.Investors have pared exposure to sectors including renewable energy and electric cars as candidates in some of the dozens of nations holding polls this year have raised concerns over the costs and speed of efforts to curb emissions.A shift to clean energy &ldquo;is just not going to be a straight line like maybe we all hoped for,&rdquo; said Sarah Norris, head of ESG equities and manager of the Global Impact Equity strategy at abrdn plc, which has trimmed some holdings in renewable project developers.    Greater uncertainty over the transition away from fossil fuels, and tougher political rhetoric, have seen clean energy firms jolted following recent polls in India, South Korea and Europe, though some have since recovered ground.A Solactive European Renewables gauge has dropped about 3% since this month&rsquo;s European Parliament election &mdash; which saw support slump for Green candidates.Government debt has tumbled in France with Marine Le Pen&rsquo;s far-right National Rally leading polls ahead of a June 30 vote in France, and development bank SFIL SA postponed a green bond sale.In the US, a backlash against green principles and positioning for a potential new Donald Trump presidency have contributed to a surge in liquidations of exchange-traded funds aligned with ESG goals, and seen the largest-ever quarterly outflows from products tied to the theme. Bets by hedge funds against the $2.2 billion iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, a flagship renewables fund, have risen to the highest in a year, short interest data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Investors are weighing both green pushback and higher-for-longer interest rates. The ETF has declined more than 22% in the past 12 months, compared with a 26% gain in the S&amp;P 500 Index.Pictet Asset Management&rsquo;s Clean Energy Transition Strategy has reduced holdings of EV stocks and is retaining only a small exposure to renewable energy, said Yi Shi, client portfolio manager. Though few investors expect Trump to scrap President Joe Biden&rsquo;s Inflation Reduction Act, which offers support for green industries, many are considering the impact of any renewed move to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on global warming, or to ease environmental regulations. A Trump victory would threaten $369 billion of tax incentives, grants and loans for clean energy, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Mirova SA&rsquo;s Co-Head of Fixed Income Bertrand Rocher said he&rsquo;s stopped buying more US debt ahead of the November election because both Trump and Biden have inflation-fanning programs. Utility stocks &mdash; some of which have already benefited from Biden&rsquo;s IRA &mdash; are a potential alternative in the US to clean energy companies, said Nordea Investment Management AB portfolio manager Johan Swahn. In Europe, data-center operators look attractive as they&rsquo;re less impacted by debate over green policies, according to abrdn&rsquo;s Norris. There is &ldquo;some movement in Europe where we believe that a wait-and-see stance is warranted,&rdquo; on green investments, said Ulrik Fugmann, co-head of the environmental strategies group at BNP Paribas Asset Management.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's power sector, particularly coal power generators and steel manufacturers, is facing challenges due to increasing water scarcity, exacerbated by the country's rapid economic growth and the impact of climate change, Moody's Ratings said in a report. The rating agency advocates for a significant shift towards renewable energy investments to mitigate these risks.According to the report, sectors that rely heavily on water for cooling and processing, such as coal power and steel manufacturing, are especially vulnerable as water availability per capita is projected to decrease significantly by 2031. Moody&rsquo;s suggests that investment in renewable energy and enhanced water management infrastructure are essential to counter these threats.The report also highlights that the Indian government has initiated several measures to bolster water infrastructure and promote renewable energy. These initiatives are seen as vital to reducing the reliance on water-intensive coal power generation.Moreover, India's developing sustainable finance market is identified as a key element in funding these critical infrastructure projects. Although still developing, this market provides new opportunities for financing projects that improve water efficiency and support the transition to renewable energy.Moody&rsquo;s underscores the urgent need for India to adapt its energy strategies to ensure the stability of its critical industrial sectors. By investing in renewable energy and improving water management, India can secure the economic stability and operational continuity of its power sector.This call to action is aimed at policymakers and industry leaders to prioritize and accelerate their efforts towards renewable energy, securing a sustainable future for the nation&rsquo;s energy landscape amidst ongoing environmental challenges.",

            "articleBody": "Adani group is looking to invest about Rs 2 lakh crore by 2030 to build 40 gigawatts of renewable energy generation capacity, as it targets net zero emissions across businesses by 2050, top officials said on Tuesday. The apple-to-airport conglomerate currently has over 10 GW of capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources like sunlight and wind energy and is looking to add 6-7 GW every year to reach 50 GW by 2030. \"Considering the ballpark number of Rs 5 crore per megawatt, the investment could be in the range of Rs 2 lakh crore by 2030,\" Adani Green Energy Ltd Executive Director Sagar Adani told reporters here. Its CEO Amit Singh said the company would also build a 5 GW pump storage capacity to peak power demand during the night when sunlight is not available, and wind intensity is not strong enough to turn wind turbines to produce electricity. The carbon credits renewable capacity generates, together with a few other measures, will help turn the group net zero by 2050.  India powers up energy network for its hotspotsThe govt is taking steps to ensure power projects, including renewable energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels, can operate effectively in the face of intense heatwaves in India. Actions involve enhancing heat tolerance levels, addressing peak power demand, upgrading transmission equipment, and implementing measures like proper ventilation in substations and transformer yards.See More DetailsAGEL added 2.8 GW capacity in the 2023-2024 (April 2023 to March 2024) fiscal, which was 15 per cent of India's total renewable energy capacity addition, Singh said. \"This year, our target is 6 GW,\" he said. Going forward, that kind of capacity addition or higher is likely every year, Adani said, adding that 80 per cent of the 50 GW capacity will be solar and the rest wind. The conglomerate is building factories to make wafers used in solar panels to generate electricity and wind turbines. Singh said the group is now looking at making 3 MW wind turbines for areas with lower wind speeds. It currently makes wind turbines of 5.2 MW capacity that are suited for high-potential areas like Khavada in Gujarat. India is the world's third-largest economy in terms of energy needs, and its energy demand is projected to surge 25-35 per cent by 2030. Its peak energy demand is estimated to be 366.4 GW by 2031-32. AGEL brought on a stream of 2,848 MW (2.8 GW) renewables capacity, the largest greenfield expansion in India's renewable energy sector. This included 2,418 MW solar and 430 MW wind projects.  Cabinet givs nod to VGF scheme for offshore wind energy with Rs 7,453 crore outlayThe Union Cabinet approved a viability gap funding (VGF) scheme for offshore wind energy projects with a total allocation of Rs 7,453 crore. This includes Rs 6,853 crore for installing and commissioning 1 GW of offshore wind projects, split into 500 MW each off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu coasts. Additionally, Rs 600 crore is earmarked for upgrading two ports to support logistics for these projects.See More DetailsOf the capacity commissioned in FY24 includes 2,000 MW of solar capacity from Adani Green Energy's World's largest renewable energy project of 30,000 MW, being built at Khavda, Gujarat. The project is spread across 538 square kilometres, almost five times the city of Paris. Once built, it will be the largest power plant in the world, regardless of the energy source. AGEL is also targeting the addition of at least 5,000 MW pumped storage project (PSP) capacity by 2030 in the first phase, Singh said. It has begun the construction of the first 500 MW PSP in Andhra Pradesh. The company has a robust development pipeline of hydro-pumped storage projects across Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. With this, AGEL has revised its renewable energy target to 50,000 MW from 45,000 MW by 2030. AGEL's current operational portfolio is 10,934 MW, which consists of 7,393 MW solar, 1,401 MW wind and 2,140 MW wind-solar hybrid capacity. It is the first company in India to surpass the 10,000 MW renewable energy capacity.  Suzlon Energy shares hit 5% upper circuit amid block dealSuzlon Energy's shares surged 5% to Rs 51.3 on BSE due to a reported block deal, where 0.3% of its equity changed hands. Details on the transaction's participants remain undisclosed. By 10:38 am, the stock traded 4% higher at Rs 50.9. Over the past year, Suzlon has delivered impressive returns, rallying 256%, and over two years, it surged 680%.See More DetailsOver the past five years, its operational capacity addition has outpaced the industry, achieving a CAGR of 41 per cent compared to India's 13 per cent. AGEL's total locked-in portfolio stands at 21,953 MW (10,934 MW is operational, and 11,019 MW is under execution). About 93 per cent of AGEL's portfolio comprising 20,368 MW is now backed by 25-year fixed tariff PPAs with sovereign/sovereign equivalent counterparties, which gives it revenue predictability, and 7 per cent is merchant portfolio, offering higher realisations.",

            "articleBody": "AHMEDABAD: The finance chief of the Adani Group conglomerate on Tuesday deemed some of the Indian market regulator notices received by group firms citing alleged regulatory lapses as \"trivial\" in nature. Led by billionaire Gautam Adani, the group has faced regulatory challenges in India since a report by short seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023. It accused group firms of improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation which sparked a $150 billion meltdown in the market value of group firms. The Adani Group denied any wrongdoing. Then last month, flagship firm Adani Enterprises and other group companies disclosed they had received notices from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) about alleged violations including non-compliance with certain provisions for listed companies. \"Some (notices) are trivial,\" Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh told a media briefing in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. He referred to one such query he himself received relating to his share trading history in relation to the time that GQG Partners invested in the group last year. \"I don't even have a demat account. They were very surprised to find out that I don't have a demat account,\" he said, referring to a trading account. \"So that ends there. So they were these kinds of procedural things. They have to do something, they couldn't find anything.\" GQG and SEBI did not respond to Reuters' requests for immediate comment. Adani since the Hindenburg report has attracted investment from investors including GQG and Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding. Group companies said the notices they received were related to disclosure rules and related party transactions, but they have not provided detail regarding the alleged violations or the parties involved. Adani Enterprises said the notices had no \"material consequential effect\" for relevant financial statements and there was \"no material non-compliance of applicable laws and regulations\". INFRASTRUCTUREAlso on Tuesday, Singh said the group would increase spending in fiscal year 2025 by 85%, to 1.3 trillion rupees ($15.6 billion), as it prepares to capitalise on an expected boom in infrastructure development. Adani Green Energy, the renewable energy arm of the group, will spend 340 billion rupees to add 6 gigawatts of capacity, Singh told reporters. Adani is also aiming to nearly double its cement making capacity to 140 million tons (MT) capacity by 2028 from 79 MT, he said. On Monday, the owner of Adani Group told investors it is \"well positioned\" to capitalise on opportunities in India's booming infrastructure sector.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Schneider Electric, a global leader in digital energy management and automation has urged the Indian government to implement policies that incentivize energy efficiency in industries, the company's Executive Vice-President of International Operations, Manish Pant, told ET Energyworld.As industries worldwide face increasing pressure to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, Schneider Electric is emphasizing the need for supportive policies that could help companies transition toward more sustainable operations. According to Pant, such measures are critical not only for environmental sustainability but also for economic efficiency.\"The government should implement policies that provide incentives for companies to focus on energy efficiency,\" Pant said in an interview. \"By reducing energy consumption, companies need less energy production, which aligns with global sustainability goals. Focusing on both electrification and energy efficiency could resolve half of the challenges in this energy transition.\"The call for policy support comes as one of the Schneider Electric group companies, Lauritz Knudsen, aims to invest approximately 850 crore rupees ($104 million) in India over the next three years. Laurits Knudsen is the new brand name of L&amp;T switchgears that was acquired by Schneider Electric Group in 2020. This investment is poised to expand the company&rsquo;s manufacturing capabilities, enhance research and development activities, and strengthen local partnerships.Schneider Electric's commitment to India is not new; the company has a robust presence with 31 manufacturing plants across the country. Notably, its plant in Hyderabad has been recognized as a Sustainable Lighthouse factory by the World Economic Forum, marking significant achievements in reducing energy, water, waste, and carbon emissions.Pant highlighted the dual benefit of the proposed investment, pointing out that it would not only advance Schneider Electric's technological and production capacities but also significantly contribute to local job creation. \"With this investment, we aim to support India&rsquo;s growth both for domestic needs and global markets,\" he added.India has become an integral part of Schneider Electric's global strategy, serving as a key hub for both manufacturing and innovation. The country's burgeoning demand for energy solutions and its strategic position in Schneider's global operations underscore the importance of supportive government policies.Moreover, Schneider Electric&rsquo;s focus extends beyond manufacturing. The company is also keen on advancing digital automation and smart energy solutions, sectors expected to play crucial roles in the future of global energy systems.Pant also discussed the broader implications of energy efficiency, suggesting that effective policy incentives could catalyze industry-wide changes. \"Energy efficiency isn't just about reducing costs or consumption; it's about transforming how industries operate and innovate. Effective policies can accelerate this transformation, benefiting the economy and the environment alike,\" he explained.",

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: Renewables energy can avoid 17 per cent of the anticipated carbon emissions from India&rsquo;s heavy industry by 2030, according to a new report by energy think-tank Ember. It added that based on industry growth projections, electricity demand for heavy industries is expected to rise by 45 per cent. Meeting this increased demand with renewable energy could help to avoid 180 million tons (Mt) of CO2, equivalent to the total annual emission of the Netherlands.At present, 11 per cent of energy consumption in these heavy industries comes from electricity, with the rest from fossil fuel-based thermal energy. &ldquo;Besides being one of the most promising levers for decarbonising industries, renewable based electrification offers multiple co-benefits. It allows industries to benefit from low cost renewable power, improves grid flexibility, and most importantly, improves air quality within industrial facilities,&rdquo; said Duttatreya Das, an independent consultant and the report&rsquo;s lead author. Das added that switching to renewables immediately and ensuring clean air within industrial premises needs to be a people-first strategy for heavy industries.The report indicates possible near and long term strategies to smash emissions as India negotiates with the EU bloc on mechanisms to comply with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). CBAM is a regulatory framework that imposes a carbon tariff on imports to the EU. It said that in order to fully decarbonise their electricity use and remain competitive in the global market, India&rsquo;s heavy industries require 120 GW of dedicated renewable energy capacity by 2030. The report focuses on the steel, cement, petrochemicals, aluminium and ammonia sectors. &ldquo;Decarbonising these emission-intensive &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; industries can significantly benefit both India&rsquo;s industrial sector and renewable energy ecosystem,&rdquo; it added.According to the report, for deep decarbonisation of industries in the longer run, the report finds that it is crucial that key technologies to electrify thermal processes become commercially viable. &ldquo;If these new technologies and the government&rsquo;s green hydrogen mission succeed, the share of electricity in the industrial energy mix could triple by 2050, reaching about 700 GW and avoiding 737Mt of emissions,&rdquo; the report added.Aditya Lolla, Asia Programme Director at Ember, said that with emissions-related trade regulations such as CBAM are expected to take effect soon, understanding the potential for near-term emission reductions is crucial for Indian heavy industries. He added that renewables-based electrification also offers multiple co-benefits to India's wider energy ecosystem. It can open up multi-million dollar private investment opportunities, stimulate India&rsquo;s clean energy manufacturing sector and propell India towards becoming a global leader in clean energy.",

            "articleBody": "MILAN: The renewable unit of energy group Enel has started up a solar plant with an installed capacity of around 87 megawatt (MW), making it the biggest in northern Italy, the company said on Tuesday. Local residents helped to pay for the solar project through a crowd-funding campaign launched in 2022 and will start to recoup their investment following the start of operations. Last year Enel's smaller rival Edison inaugurated a new hydroelectric power station partly financed by the local community and its wider customer base. The latest project is located in the town of Trino, in Piedmont in the northwest, on a site that was home to a nuclear power plant until the country voted in 1987 to ban the production of atomic energy. It comprises 160,000 photo-voltaic panels. Until last year, Italy's energy transition had largely consisted of the installation of myriad rooftop solar panels, a small-scale strategy which has kept the country's power generation costs high and slowed its path towards decarbonisation. The Trino solar farm will produce approximately 130 gigawatt hour (GWh) per year, providing green energy to meet power needs of roughly 47,000 households, Enel said in a statement. The plant is also equipped with a 25 MW battery energy storage system with a storage capacity of 100 megawatt hour (MWh). An additional, larger storage system is scheduled for installation at the site in the near future. Italy's right-wing coalition last month approved rules aimed at curbing the installation of solar panels on agricultural land, triggering criticism that it could undermine Rome's decarbonisation goals.

            "articleBody": "Sacramento: One method of making electricity cleanly to address climate change has been quietly advancing and on Tuesday it hit a milestone. A California utility is backing the largest new geothermal power development in the US - 400 megawatts of clean electricity from the Earth's heat - enough for some 4,00,000 homes.  Southern California Edison will purchase the electricity from Fervo Energy, a Houston-based geothermal company, Fervo announced.  The company is drilling up to 125 wells in southwest Utah.  Clean electricity like this reduces the need for traditional power plants that cause climate change. The boost could go a long way toward bringing down the cost of a new generation of geothermal energy, said Wilson Ricks, an energy systems researcher at Princeton University.  \"If these purchases help to get this technology off the ground, it could be massively impactful for global decarbonization,\" he said.  Decarbonization refers to switching out things that produce carbon dioxide and methane, which cause the climate to change, in favor of machines and methods that don't.  Today the world still relies mainly on fossil fuels for round-the-clock power. This new deal shows that clean power can meet a growing demand for electricity, said Sarah Jewett, vice president of strategy at Fervo.  \"I think that's why it's so exciting. This isn't a niche energy resource going to a niche use,\" she said. \"And that is something we have not had, you know, readily available\" and able to be scaled up.  The first generation of geothermal plants, for example, The Geysers in California, tapped into superheated reservoirs of steam or very hot water close to the Earth's surface. Such reservoirs are relatively rare.  New geothermal companies are adapting drilling technology and practices taken from the oil and gas industry to create reservoirs from hot rock. That unlocks the potential for geothermal energy in many more places.  Engineers have been working to advance the methods for years.  The United States is one of the world leaders in using the Earth's heat to make electricity, but geothermal still accounts for less than half a percent of the nation's total large-scale electricity generation, according to the US Energy Information Administration.  Fervo is pioneering horizontal drilling in geothermal reservoirs. It signed the world's first corporate agreement with Google in 2021 to develop new geothermal power and drilled three wells in Nevada. That project began sending carbon-free electricity onto the Nevada grid in November to power data centers there.  Cape Station, about 200 miles south of Salt Lake City, is expected to start delivering electricity to California as early as 2026.  California Energy Commission Chair David Hochschild said the state is committed to clean, zero-carbon electricity. He said geothermal complements wind and solar farms by providing steady power when it's not windy or sunny, and that is key to ensuring reliability as the state cuts fossil fuels.",

            "articleBody": "Ahmedabad: Adani group plans to invest about Rs 1.3 lakh crore across its portfolio companies this fiscal as it doubles down on its USD 100 billion investment guidance over the next 7-10 years to grow businesses, group CFO said on Tuesday. The investment across portfolio companies that range from ports to energy, airports, commodities, cement and media will be 70 per cent met through internal cash generation and the remaining through debt, Group CFO Jugeshinder 'Robbie' Singh told reporters here.  The group will look to refinance USD 3-4 billion of debt maturing in the year and raise an additional USD 1 billion in project financing, he said, adding the annual USD 2-2.5 billion of equity infusion by bringing in new investors is also likely to continue.  \"This year will be more about asset completion,\" he said.  Renewable energy firm Adani Green will complete 6-7 GW project, while the solar wafer manufacturing unit will attain scale. Also, the new airport at Mumbai will be completed, he said.  The projected capital expenditure or capex for 2024-25 (April 2024 to March 2025) fiscal is 40 per cent higher than what the portfolio is estimated to have incurred in FY24.  The group had previously guided a USD 100 billion capex over the next 7-10 years. Most of this investment is going to go into the group's fast growing businesses -- renewable, green hydrogen and airports and infrastructure, he said.  As much as 70 per cent of the planned capex will go into its green portfolio -- primarily renewable power, green hydrogen, green evacuation. Of the remaining 30 per cent, the majority will be spent towards airports and ports businesses.  Adani Group companies posted a record 45 per cent rise in pre-tax profit (Ebitda) to Rs 82,917 crore (about USD 10 billion) in FY24, Singh said.  Emerging from a damning report of a US short seller, which hit the market value of its listed companies, Adani Group in 2023-24 focused on containing debt, reducing founder share pledge and consolidating the business in core competencies. The five-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) for profit growth was 54 per cent.  A school drop-out, group chairman Gautam Adani started out as a commodities trader and rose to be counted among world's richest with an empire spanning across ports, power generation, airports, mining, renewables, gas, data centres, media and cement.  Today, Adani Group is the world's second largest solar power company, it is the largest airport operator with 25 per cent of passenger traffic and 40 per cent of air cargo, the largest ports and logistics company with 30 per cent of national market share, largest integrated energy player, and the country's second largest cement manufacturer.  With strong emphasis on green energy transition, it will be allocating more than 70 per cent of this USD 100 billion to its green businesses including renewable power, green hydrogen, and green evacuation transmission lines.  The conglomerate is building the world's largest renewable park at Khavda, Gujarat, spanning over 530 square kilometers - an area five times the size of the city of Paris.  A large portion of total investments is earmarked for expansion and development of its fast-growing airports business and ports business.  With a portfolio boasting eight airports including the upcoming Navi Mumbai airport and 14 domestic ports, Adani wants to further solidify its presence in these sectors.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Renewable energy investor Alcazar Energy Partners said on Tuesday it has launched the largest wind farm project in North Macedonia with an investment of at least $500 million in debt and equity to help generate 400 megawatts of renewable energy. The Shtip project, located 75 km south of the capital Skopje, is a central part of a deal announced at the COP28 climate talks last year to accelerate the country's shift away from coal-fired power generation. Construction is set to begin in early 2026. Once up and running, the project is expected to provide an almost fivefold increase in the country's installed wind capacity, able to power more than 100,000 homes and avoid the release of over 670,000 tons of climate-damaging carbon emissions a year. \"Alcazar Energy views North Macedonia as an especially promising investment location, recognising its significant potential for renewable energy development,\" Alcazar co-founder Daniel Calderon said in a statement. Due to its location and grid connections with Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Kosovo, the project should help reduce energy shortages and support the energy transition across the broader region. Financing will be overseen by Alcazar, which recently raised $490 million through Alcazar Energy Partners II, with backing from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and other public and private investors. \"This project is of great significance to Europe, given North Macedonia's extensive grid interconnections with its neighbours,\" said Hristijan Mickoski, Prime Minister of North Macedonia. \"It will supply much-needed clean and affordable energy at a crucial time when the continent is striving to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.\" ",

            "articleBody": "India expects a surge in domestic solar cell-making capacity in the coming months, which will help reduce its dependence on imported materials from China to manufacture solar panels, the country&rsquo;s top renewable energy official said. The nation&rsquo;s cells capacity is set to jump five-fold to about 30 gigawatts a year by March 2025, Renewable Energy Secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said in an interview in New Delhi. This will allow the government to widen import restrictions aimed at boosting local adoption of solar power hardware and achieving Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s goal of increasing self-sufficiency in the sector.In a bid to wean itself off Chinese imports, India has levied taxes on some solar components and introduced a so-called approved list of models and manufacturers, a non-tariff trade barrier that&rsquo;s essentially meant to keep foreign shipments out. US and European officials have also complained that a flood of new supply from Chinese solar companies has overwhelmed global demand and is stymieing efforts to develop their own supply chains. The Biden administration last month issued a suite of rules strengthening tariffs against Chinese solar equipment.But while India&rsquo;s domestic module output has already picked up thanks to existing import curbs, manufacturers continue to rely on China for other back-end products that go into making solar panels.Cells, another component, will be the next item to be restricted, though the government will be more cautious this time around, according to Bhalla.&ldquo;We plan to give the industry around two years time to prepare so that we have ample domestic capacity,&rdquo; Bhalla said. &ldquo;It should be a firm, forward-looking policy.&rdquo;The government had to temporarily withdraw the non-tariff import restriction on modules last year after the local industry complained that tightening supplies were disrupting projects. Manufacturers are also hoping for higher domestic demand before committing to new capacities, according to Rohit Gadre, a BloombergNEF analyst based in Mumbai. &ldquo;In absence of adequate local demand, manufacturers will be looking out for strong growth in the export markets for cells and modules made in India,&rdquo; Gadre said.",

This is the company&rsquo;s fourth hybrid project with SECI and with this, its hybrid utility portfolio now stands at 1.75 GW out of a total utility portfolio of 2.8 GW plus. The project will be designed for interconnection to the ISTS network, with a contracted capacity of 150 MW and would require installation of over 246 MW wind and solar capacity.&ldquo;We are happy to secure our third consecutive utility bid within a month reinforcing our position as a leader in leading India&rsquo;s renewable energy transition,&rdquo; he added. Bhattacharyya said that the project is expected to be completed within 24 months from the date of PPA signing. The PPA for this project will be executed for 25 years with SECI.",

            "articleBody": "Washington: The World Bank has approved a $700 million loan to help Egypt boost private sector participation in its economy, which has suffered from the fallout of the Israel-Gaza conflict, the organization said Monday.The program is designed to help address short-term economic challenges, \"unleash private sector growth,\" build macroeconomic and fiscal resilience, and move the country onto a greener growth trajectory, the World Bank said in a statement.The green aspects of the loan program will include support for \"scaling up renewable energy and increasing efficiency in the electricity, water and sanitation sectors,\" it added. The loan forms part of the Bank's three-year, $6 billion commitment to Egypt announced back in March, which came after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expanded its own loan program with the country to more than $8 billion to help buttress its economy.Egypt's economy is still dominated by military-linked enterprises, and for years focused on expensive infrastructure mega-projects.In recent years, the economy has been hit by a series of challenges, including the war in Ukraine, which pushed up wheat prices, and the start of attacks against international shipping by Yemen's Huthi rebels following the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza conflict. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said earlier this year that revenues from the Suez Canal -- which is a key source of foreign exchange for the economy -- had \"decreased by 40 to 50 percent\" because of the attacks. \"Creating good, sustainable jobs and building resilience to climate change are critical for the current and future prosperity of Egypt's citizens -- especially the poor and vulnerable,\" World Bank country director for Egypt, Yemen and Djibouti Stephane Guimbert said in a statement Monday. \"Reforms supported by this operation are an important step towards a more sustainable, inclusive economy,\" he added.

            "articleBody": "Tokyo: Hundreds of multinational corporations on Tuesday urged Japan to triple its capacity to generate renewable power by 2035, as the heavily coal-dependent country updates its energy policy.Dubbed RE100, the group of more than 400 large companies that have committed to work towards using all-renewable electricity includes 87 Japanese firms such as Sony and Panasonic.\"By increasing its domestic renewables capacity, Japan can significantly improve its energy security, safeguard its international competitiveness, and increase private investment in more renewables projects,\" the group said.It called for Japan to use its Strategic Energy Plan -- set to be unveiled later this year -- to triple installed renewables capacity from 121 gigawatts in 2022 to 363 gigawatts before 2035. At the COP28 climate talks in December, nearly 120 nations including Japan pledged to triple the world's renewable energy within seven years -- a global effort in which each country's contribution may vary.Japan, at 22.6 percent, and the United States are the Group of Seven countries with the lowest share of renewables in their current power generation, according to International Energy Agency figures from 2022.The Japanese government is targeting carbon neutrality by 2050 but was reluctant to set a date to phase out coal-fired power plants at this year's G7 climate meeting, where ministers agreed to a goal of the mid-2030s.They also preserved a place for coal power if it is \"abated\", meaning its emissions are captured or limited by technology -- something panned by many as unproven and a distraction from cutting fossil fuel use.RE100 was founded 10 years ago by the international non-profit Climate Group in partnership with global NGO Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which tracks and rates companies' climate pledges.Ahead of Japan's revised energy strategy, it has set out six policy recommendations to improve \"the availability, accessibility, and affordability of renewables in Japan.\"The world's fourth-largest economy is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, partly because many nuclear reactors remain offline after the 2011 Fukushima meltdown.",

            "articleBody": "DETROIT: Patricia Kobylski remembers when there were lots of people living in her eastside Detroit neighborhood. There aren't as many anymore - and haven't been for a long time. \"Right now, on our side of the street there are probably only 10 houses. Should be 50, 60,\" the 78-year-old Kobylski said Monday after the city announced a plan to bring to her neighborhood solar arrays, which are blocks of ground-based solar panels. Detroit is using something it has plenty of - vacant land - to produce something the city needs - clean and relatively inexpensive energy. Pending approval by the City Council, Kobylski's Gratiot-Findlay neighborhood eventually will see solar arrays on about 23 acres (9.3 hectares) of land. Not far away, another eastside neighborhood is to get arrays on nearly 41 acres (16.5 hectares), while a third will get arrays on nearly 40 acres (16.1 hectares). Five other neighborhoods are finalists to also get solar arrays. Resident groups had to apply to be considered for the program. The city is looking to build solar energy arrays on about 200 acres (81 hectares). The arrays would produce enough clean energy to offset the electricity used currently by 127 municipal buildings. Detroit will use $14 million from an existing utility fund for up-front costs that include acquiring and clearing the land. The solar fields are expected to ultimately save the city $4.4 million per year. \"We have seen property values and income tax revenues grow dramatically in other neighborhoods where the city has made investments,\" Mayor Mike Duggan said. \"I'm confident our $1.1 million-a-year investment in these long-forgotten neighborhoods will produce a real recovery in these communities.\" The city touts its Solar Neighborhoods project as a national model for finding solutions to climate change. Duggan revealed plans a year ago following a challenge by President Joe Biden for cities to use more solar power while taking advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides federal tax incentives of 30% or more of the costs to cover renewable energy. Over the past year, neighborhood groups held meetings to consider hosting solar fields. Those selected will receive $15,000 to $25,000 in community benefits to pay for energy efficiency upgrades. They can choose to use the benefits for new windows, roof repairs, new energy efficient appliances, new furnaces and hot water heaters, better home insulation, smart thermostats, energy-efficient lighting and battery back-up for outages. Duggan said he hopes to break ground on the project by the end of the year. Donna Anthony, 63, also is in one of the three neighborhoods announced Monday. She wants to get new attic insulation, vinyl siding and a new generator for her home. Anthony also looks forward to not having vacant lots and abandoned houses nearby, which often become sites for illegal dumping. \"When you come outside you get depressed when you see all this trash being dropped,\" Anthony said of discarded tires and construction materials. \"You go out and clean it up and it's right back there the next day.\" Under Duggan, the city has made leaps in stabilizing and fixing up neighborhoods that had been deteriorating and in advanced stages of blight. Primarily with federal funds at its disposal, Detroit has demolished at least 24,000 vacant structures since 2014, according to the mayor's office. Hundreds of others have been transferred to the Detroit Land Bank which has fixed up many houses and resold them to families. Dozens of vacant lots - left by the razing of homes - are being sold to people living next door to maintain and beautify what otherwise would become overgrown, weedy eyesores. Secure solar farms could also be an aesthetic benefit in these areas, according to Sarah Banas Mills, director of the Center for EmPowering Communities, Graham Sustainability Institute at the University of Michigan. \"There are not very many communities that would say 'You know, the thing that would make this better is a solar farm,'\" Mills said. \"A neighborhood might want a solar farm there to effectively fight illegal dumping. That's a really unique way of thinking.\" \"On more developed land, places that aren't green field right now, solar is sometimes perceived as a negative change to the landscape,\" Mills continued. \"In places that already are industrial, it is as an improvement.\" About 633,000 people call Detroit home - more than a million fewer than the 1.8 million who lived in the city in the 1950s. What Detroit may lack in population, it makes up for in land. Currently, about 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of the 139-square-mile (360-square-kilometers) city is vacant. \"The challenge with solar is that it's an industrial investment,\" said Anika Goss, chief executive of Detroit Future City, a nonprofit focused on improving the lives of the city's residents through community and economic development. \"Unlike trees or some sort of stormwater management, it has its downsides,\" she continued. Since the panels absorb energy from the sun, they can also create heat islands - or parts of cities with higher average temperatures than the surrounding areas - \"in places that might already have challenges with heat islands.\" Goss also said she is disappointed that the energy produced by the solar arrays will not be used to lower utility bills for residents in the selected neighborhoods. \"The checks that they're giving as a community benefit for energy, I think that's a good thing,\" she said. \"They can use it for window upgrades. They can use it for their own stormwater management. It's not enough for a new roof, but it could be enough to put something in that could make their own home energy efficient.\" The city says 21 homeowners in the selected neighborhoods have chosen buy-outs to allow for demolition of their houses to make way for the arrays. Renters will receive the cost of relocating and 1.5 years of free rent when they move.",

            "articleBody": "BISMARCK: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has emerged as a serious contender to be Donald Trump's running mate. He's one of the president's most loyal and vocal backers and brings executive experience, business savvy and close connections to deep-pocketed energy industry CEOs. Trump wants their money to help finance his third run for the White House.  But back home, far from the glare of the campaign trail, the two-term governor is wrestling with a $5.5 billion carbon dioxide pipeline project that has split his state and left him straddling an awkward political divide as Trump and President Joe Biden offer voters starkly different visions of how to tackle - or ignore - climate change. A pipeline champion Burgum is championing the CO2 pipeline, which is being financed by hundreds of investors and will be built by Summit Carbon Solutions of Ames, Iowa. The project would gather planet-warming CO2 from ethanol plants across the Midwest and permanently deposit the potentially harmful gas a mile underground in west central North Dakota.  The CO2 pipeline aligns with Biden's push to address climate change, a position that could put Burgum at odds with Trump. In backing the pipeline, Burgum is navigating the tricky politics of land ownership in deep-red North Dakota and of climate change inside the GOP. While Burgum has outlined plans to make North Dakota carbon neutral by 2030, he's steered clear of describing the pipeline or other carbon capture initiatives as environmentally friendly. Instead, he touts them as a lucrative business opportunity for North Dakota that might ultimately assist the fossil fuel industry. \"This has nothing to do with climate change,\" Burgum said in early March on a North Dakota radio program. \"This has to do with markets.\" Trouble at home The blowback in North Dakota to the Summit project has been intense with Burgum caught in the crossfire. There are fears a pipeline rupture would unleash a lethal cloud of CO2. Landowners worry their property values will plummet if the pipeline passes under their land. And they're outraged over what they allege are hardball tactics employed by Summit to secure the easements it needs for the massive project.  Kurt Swenson and his family own or have an interest in 1,750 acres at or near the proposed storage site. At a public hearing earlier this month on Summit's permit application, Swenson said he had a warning for anyone who attempts to take his land without his consent. \"It seems like everybody wants what isn't theirs,\" Swenson said. \"You're going to end up taking it from my cold, dead hands. And you're going to see how that works out for you.\" Summit said it has signed easement deals with landowners along 82% of the pipeline's route in North Dakota and obtained 92% of the lease agreements needed at the storage site. The company added that the project also is supported by state lawmakers and emergency managers. Close ties to the oil and gas industry Oil and gas interests have donated nearly $8 million to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, according to the political money website Open Secrets.  Burgum, with his close ties to his state's dominant industry, is the type of running mate who could help boost such donations. If Burgum isn't the GOP's vice-presidential nominee and doesn't land a job in a second Trump administration, he can return to North Dakota to finish out his last term, with key decisions looming for the pipeline.",

            "articleBody": "London: The UK's Opposition Labour Party on Monday criticised the governing Conservatives led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of having \"over-promised and under-delivered\" on relations with India and declared that it is \"ready to go\" on striking a free trade agreement (FTA) if it wins the July 4 general election. Addressing the India Global Forum (IGF) in the final full week of the election campaign, the party's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy laid out his ambitions of the FTA being \"a floor not a ceiling\" of the partnership he aspires to with his \"friend\" External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. India and the UK have completed 13 rounds of FTA negotiations to enhance the estimated GBP 38.1 billion a year trading relationship, with talks currently stalled amid the election cycles in both countries. \"Many Diwalis have come and gone without a trade deal and too many businesses have been left waiting,\" said Lammy, referring to the missed Diwali 2022 deadline set by former prime minister Boris Johnson for the FTA. \"My message to [Finance] Minister [Nirmala] Sitharaman and [Trade] Minister [Piyush] Goyal is that Labour is ready to go. Let's finally get our free trade deal done and move on,\" he said, adding he will be in Delhi before the end of July if elected to government on July 4.Lammy said the Conservatives have \"over-promised and under-delivered\" on the UK's relations with India. Describing India as a \"priority\" for the party and an economic, technological and cultural \"superpower\", Lammy sought to set the tone for his future tenure in a Labour-led Cabinet - hopeful of taking charge as the country's foreign secretary. \"With Labour, the days of Boris Johnson reciting that old verse from Rudyard Kipling in Asia are over. If I recite a poem in India, it will be Tagore...because with a superpower like India, the areas of cooperation and the areas for learning are limitless,\" he said. From a wider foreign policy perspective, Lammy stressed a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" working in partnership with India. \"We stand for a rules-based order and against those who wish to redraw borders by force with a new form of imperialism, like [Russian President] Mr Putin in Europe; and those in Asia who wish to impose their will on their neighbours denying them free choices,\" he said. \"Europe and Asia are not two separate worlds...In this challenging environment, Britain will remain and seek to ramp up the security partnership with India - from military to maritime security, from cyber to critical and emerging technologies, from defence and industrial cooperation to supply chain security,\" Lammy added. With Labour far ahead of the incumbent Tories in all pre-election opinion polls, Lammy also drew parallels with the shared democratic values in both countries as he congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his re-election. \"I deeply believe that India's democratic elections, with almost a billion voters, are the most important statement, the most important validation, not only of the democratic ideal but of democratic practice in today's world. This is something that binds us together,\" Lammy said. Flagging climate change as one of the key areas of collaboration, the frontline Labour politician said the UK stood in solidarity with India through the extreme temperatures across the country. \"There can be no energy transition without an Indian energy transition. India is the indispensable partner, not only to Britain but the whole developed world,\" he noted. He also hailed the \"extraordinary contribution\" of British Indians, not only the largest diaspora community in the UK but \"without whom it would be hard to even imagine modern Britain\". Guyanese-heritage Lammy concluded by highlighting his own personal India connect, saying his \"great-grandmother was an Indian from Calcutta who set sail as an indentured labourer to the Caribbean\". \"India contributes so much to British prosperity already. Last year, India was our second-largest foreign direct investment contributor...but it could be so, so much more as India is only our twelfth-largest trade partner,\" he said.",

As the world's largest consumer and second-largest producer of sugar, India has been nominated to chair the ISO for 2024, an official statement said.  The event kicked off with an industrial tour to a grain-based distillery in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on June 24, demonstrating India's adoption of cutting-edge technology in biofuel production.  The main proceedings begin on June 25 with a workshop titled \"Sugar and Biofuels -- Emerging Vistas\" at Bharat Mandapam, to be inaugurated by Union Minister for Food as well as New &amp; Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi.  Over 200 delegates, including international representatives, top management from Indian sugar mills, and industry associations, are expected to participate in discussions on the global sugar sector, biofuels, sustainability, and the role of farmers.  The event also aims to bolster the Global Biofuel Alliance, an initiative spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to promote sustainable biofuels worldwide.  Sanjeev Chopra, Secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution, will chair the ISO committee meetings, focusing on administrative and functional aspects of the organization. The program will conclude with cultural tours, including visits to the Red Fort and the Prime Ministers' Museum and Library.  This event not only showcases India's leadership in the sugar and biofuel sectors but also provides a platform for global collaboration on sustainable energy solutions.  With many ISO member countries also part of the Global Biofuel Alliance, the meeting presents an opportunity to expand the alliance and promote biofuels as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The ISO, a UN-affiliated body headquartered in London, brings together 85 member countries representing nearly 90 per cent of global sugar production. Its mandate includes fostering mutual understanding and progressive approaches in addressing issues related to the sugar sector and biofuels.  As the host nation, India aims to present its rich cultural heritage to the international delegates through a cultural program scheduled for the evening of June 25, offering visitors a glimpse into the country's diverse traditions.",

JSW is one of the largest Indian investors in the United States, investing more than USD 2 billion here in this country, in Texas and in Ohio. They have seen tremendous return on their investment,\" he said. This FDI would result in jobs for more than 800 American workers. Garcetti also said that the relationship between India and the US has never been so good. \"We've never had a closer relationship with India. Americans of Indian descent are now about 1.5% of our population. And pay six per cent of the taxes in America. It is the most successful immigrant community in America,\" he said. \"While the story used to be about American companies going to India to invest, which we still do,... increasingly we're seeing this two-way street, a bridge in the Indo-pacific coming from India into the United States, savings steel mills, looking at mines that have been shut down, investing in electrolytes for electric vehicles of the future, the services, the health care,\" Garcetti said. Diane Farrell, Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade, from the Department of Commerce said India has the largest country delegation to the SelectUSA Investment Summit. Divyakumar Bhair, Board Member, JSW Steel USA said that these investments would go into manufacturing high-end steel plates which are used for offshore wind, monopile, transition pieces, and towers. \"This will not only help realise the dream of clean energy for the generations to come in the United States but will also catalyse the local economies of Texas,\" he said. JSW USA is part of the diversified USD 24 billion JSW Group.",

            "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Passenger vehicle sales are projected to grow at a moderate 3-5 per cent this financial year on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking order book and subdued demand for entry-level variants, a report said on Monday. According to the report by credit ratings agency CareEdge, following robust growth of 90 per cent with volumes at 90,432 units in FY24, with an improving penetration rate, electric car sales in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment is likely to clock volume of around 1.30-1.50 lakh units in FY25.  In FY22 and FY23, the PV industry experienced substantial year-on-year volume growth due to pent-up demand post-Covid recovery and new product introductions, it said.  Utility vehicles played a significant role, with volumes increasing by 41 per cent in FY22 and 33.2 per cent in FY23. The industry benefitted from lower interest rates and an increased desire for personal mobility in the wake of the pandemic, CareEdge said.  According to CareEdge, utility vehicles contributed 10-15 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales until FY12. It grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.51 per cent between FY13 and FY24, as consumer preference shifted towards utility vehicles that offered better and innovative designs, new models, technological, functional and safety features.  For the past decade, the utility vehicles segment has consistently outperformed the passenger vehicle industry growth rate. In FY24, for the first time utility vehicles sales volume stood higher than passenger cars and vans, it said.  Currently, utility vehicles account for over 55 per cent of all new PV sales and its share in overall passenger vehicle (PV) sales is expected to further rise over the medium-term, CareEdge said.  \"The PV industry is expected to exhibit moderate volume growth of around 3-5 per cent in FY25 on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking orderbook and expectation of persistently subdued demand for entry-level variants in FY25,\" said Arti Roy, Associate Director at CareEdge Ratings.  Strong demand for new model launches and SUVs coupled with the expectation of interest rate cuts in the second half of FY25 is expected to keep the sales momentum rolling, she added.  However, in line with CareEdge Ratings' expectation of volume growth of around 7-9 per cent in FY24, the PV industry volumes grew by 7.4 per cent in FY24, the ratings said.  This moderation in year-on-year volume growth in FY24 was due to the levelling off of pent-up demand amid a hike in vehicle prices, high base effect of FY23 and the high-interest rate environment, it said.  Strong order book in FY24, robust demand for new model launches and increasing demand in the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment kept the sales momentum rolling, as per the report.  \"While the market for premium vehicles is predicted to thrive, driven by a surge in demand for luxury and high-end models, entry-level variants are likely to see continued diminished demand due to a downturn in both rural and urban markets,\" said Hardik Shah, Director at CareEdge Ratings.  The rural sector is feeling the pinch as entry-level vehicles are becoming more expensive, whereas urban consumers are increasingly opting for SUVs, reflecting a shift in market preferences, Shah added.",

            "articleBody": "Paris: Organisers of the 2024 Paris Olympics promised to take \"unprecedented\" action for the climate by halving the carbon footprint of previous Games and financing projects to reduce planet-heating greenhouse gases. But experts remain sceptical, especially after organisers dropped a pledge to set a hard limit on its overall carbon cost.About one-third of the heat-trapping emissions from the three-week spectacle is expected to come from transport, with millions of athletes, spectators, staff and journalists flying into Paris.Organisers opted mostly for pre-existing or temporary infrastructure to host the event, avoiding the significant environmental cost from carbon-intensive building materials like concrete and steel.But the Games' sustainability credentials took a hit when an initial commitment to set a definite ceiling on emissions at 1.58 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent was dumped.    \"The quantified target, which was the big step forward compared to previous Games and was announced with great fanfare, has been abandoned,\" said Martin Muller from the Institute of Geography and Sustainability at Lausanne University.\"Without a quantified goal, there is no verifiable obligation.\"Organisers instead promised that the Olympics would emit half the average emissions of the 2012 and 2016 Games in London and Rio de Janeiro -- an amount Muller said would be 3.9 million tonnes of CO2. Paris 2024 could \"emit 1.95 million tonnes and still say they have achieved their objective\" despite \"an increase of more than 20 percent compared to the initial target,\" he said.- Climate contribution - Organisers said the Games would make a \"positive contribution to the climate\" through the purchase of carbon credits, which offset pollution by funding projects that reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions.This language was also criticised and amended, and organisers now say the Games will \"support climate contribution projects that cut and capture CO2 at levels which match the Games' emissions that can't be avoided\". This could include projects which protect forests, plant trees or roll out renewable energy, organisers said, without providing further details. \"Framing their investments in credits as 'climate contribution' not offsets is a great way to stay honest about an organisation's own footprint while supporting and financing progress to global net zero goals,\" said Kaya Axelsson from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford. Benja Faecks from Carbon Market Watch, a nonprofit industry watchdog, also said that amended phrasing \"doesn't mislead the public into believing that the Games have no impact on the climate\".\"Carbon credits should be used to support projects that are worth financing, but never to 'compensate for emissions',\" he said.Carbon Market Watch previously found that the Games' climate strategy was \"incomplete and falls short of achieving transparency\", citing the lack of detailed methodologies and monitoring.- 'Unjustified plastic pollution' -  Activists have voiced concern about the level of plastic waste during the Games, and the involvement of major corporate sponsor Coca-Cola.Under pressure, organisers said an estimated 9.6 million drinks would be distributed from fountains or glass bottles, 6.2 million poured into reusable cups, and 2.2 million recycled plastic bottles given to athletes.France Nature Environnement (FNE), a network of advocacy groups, accused Coca-Cola of \"unjustified plastic pollution\" and attacked plans to pour drinks from recycled plastic bottles into reusable plastic cups as \"subterfuge\".\"Recycling is not the solution: Coca-Cola should have reduced its plastic,\" Axele Gibert, of FNE, told AFP.In 2023, Coca-Cola topped a ranking of brands responsible for the worst plastic pollution carried out by NGO Break Free From Plastic, based on an audit of waste collected by volunteers in 41 countries. - Greener Games -Researchers like Muller have proposed solutions to make the Olympics more sustainable. \"First, greatly reducing the size of the event; second, rotating the Olympics among the same cities; third, enforcing independent sustainability standards,\" he co-wrote in a study published in Nature Sustainability in 2021. To limit air travel, NGO The Shifters proposed to \"maximise in future the sale of tickets to local spectators and those coming from neighbouring countries, whose journeys are less emission intensive\". This could be coupled with \"decentralised fan zones managed by the organising country and located in different continents to welcome spectators travelling shorter distances\".",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Billionaire Gautam Adani on Monday cited record earnings, robust cash positions and the lowest debt ratios to state that his ports-to-energy conglomerate was stronger than ever and its best is yet to come. With India marching towards becoming a USD 10 trillion economy by 2032 and infrastructure expected to grow at 20-25 per cent to reach USD 2.5 trillion, Adani group being an infrastructure company \"at the very core\", is \"well positioned to capitalise on the upcoming opportunities\", he said.  Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting of his group's flagship firm, Adani Enterprises Ltd, India's second richest person reflected upon the unprecedented crisis his conglomerate faced last year following a damning report by a US short seller.  \"We were faced with baseless accusations made by a foreign short seller that questioned our decades of hard work. In the face of an unprecedented attack on our integrity and reputation, we fought back and proved that no challenge could weaken the foundations on which your Group has been established,\" said Adani, who turned 62 on Monday.  Hindenburg Research came out with a litany of findings, accusing the Adani group of stock manipulation, accounting fraud, inflating valuations, siphoning out money and creating a complex web of shell companies that invested in group entities, flouting regulatory norms. Adani Group denied all allegations but this did not prevent its market values from dropping by USD 150 billion at its lowest point.  \"Typical short sellers target gains from financial markets. This was different. It was a two-sided attack - a vague criticism of our financial standing and, at the same time, an information distortion campaign, dragging us into a political battlefield,\" he said.  The report came two days before AEL's Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offer - the largest ever in India - closed in January 2023.  \"Amplified by a segment of vested media, it was designed to defame us, do maximum damage and erode our hard-earned market value,\" he said, adding that \"given the noise\", the group returned proceeds from the offering after successfully raising Rs 20,000 crore.  Dwelling upon the strategy, he said the group raised Rs 40,000 crore to cover for debt repayments of the next two years, pre-paid Rs 17,500 crore of margin-linked financing, cut down debt and improved business focus.  \"This approach has not only strengthened our financial resilience but has also increased our headroom for future expansion,\" he said. \"The headwinds that tested us became the very ones that made us even stronger.\"  He went on to showcase the 30 GW renewable energy park his group is developing at Gujarat's Khavda, in one of the world's toughest deserts, that will be enough to power nations like Belgium and Switzerland, the Dharavi redevelopment that promises to transform the world's largest slum over the next decade, and the development of Drishti 10 Starliner UAV that will help protect the Indian borders.  \"And the outcomes are manifested in the financial numbers we delivered. We achieved an unprecedented milestone in 2023-24. We recorded our highest EBITDA of Rs 82,917 crore - or approximately USD 10 billion - a remarkable surge of 45 per cent,\" he said, adding that net profit soared 71 per cent to a record high of Rs 40,129 crore while net debt to EBITDA fell from 3.3x to 2.2x over the past year.  And all of this resulted in an all-time-high level of liquidity for the Group with a cash balance of Rs 59,791 crore.  \"With our record results, robust cash positions and the lowest debt ratios in our history, our path ahead is illuminated with the promise of even greater accomplishments,\" he said. \"The possibilities before us are immense. We are stronger than ever. And our best is yet to come.\"  Adani said in a world that stands at a crossroads of geopolitical tensions, growing fight against climate change and technology change disrupting lives and work, the world is witnessing the rise of India.  \"This is India's moment,\" he said. \"We are now the force for stability, cooperation and progress in a complex world. And it is India's macroeconomic stability and ambitious growth plans that inspire our confidence.\"  India, he said, is no longer at the crossroads of destiny. \"We stand on the brink of our greatest growth phase. By the end of this decade, our nation is set to become the world's third-largest economy,\" he said.",

The survey was conducted by Luminous Power Technologies, involving 4,318 respondents from 5 metros and 8 non-metro cities.  About 90 per cent of the respondents of 'Solar Spectrum of New India' survey acknowledge the need for specialized skills in solar panel installation, and 45 per cent believed skilled labour is unavailable locally.  \"The top barriers to the adoption of solar power in India are shortage of specialized skills, perceived cost implications and accessibility,\" it said.  The study further said that around 59 per cent respondents have concerns over high initial installation costs.  \"A noteworthy proportion believe that the cost of implementing solar power solutions is slightly more compared to traditional energy sources,\" it said.  This suggests the need to build awareness of financial schemes and avenues available for consumers who are prepared to adopt such solutions but refrain due to reservations about the cost.  Luminous is into manufacturing of solar panels, batteries and invertors.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: In the time to come, you may get continuous electricity supply even if there is a technical fault in the power transmission or distribution system or the grid develops a snag.Power distribution company BSES, which supplies electricity to nearly two-third of Delhi through its two subsidiaries, has started working on India&rsquo;s first utility-scale standalone Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), which is said to be the largest in south Asia.  Being installed at BSES Rajdhani&rsquo;s Kilokari substation in south Delhi, the system will serve as an alternative source of power supply in the local area when there is a power cut due to unforeseen reasons. BSES Rajdhani has already got the approval from the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) to initiate the project and it should be ready to be commissioned within 10-12-months. Once commissioned, more residential areas will be taken up under the project. Officials said the project would be designed to handle the extreme variations in electricity demand, improve power supply, reduce network overloading and enhance the grid stability. It will also help in reducing the cost of power procurement and integrate renewable energy, thus deferring the need for capacity upgrades at the 33/11 kv power sub-station at Kilokri.&ldquo;The BESS is being installed using cutting-edge technology as a cost-effective option for managing electricity distribution at high and medium levels,&rdquo; said a BSES official.BSES Rajdhani is working on the project in partnership with IndiGrid and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet&rsquo;s (GEAPP) and likely to improve power supply for nearly one lakh residents Kilokri, a heavily congested low-income residential pocket. With its easy deployment, the project will set templates for other state electricity regulatory commissions and power discoms, paving the way for future projects across the country.BESS will use Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which is said to be the most advanced and proven technology in its league. The system can be used as a generation, transmission and a distribution asset. In case of a power cut, it can serve the electricity demand locally. It can operate both in parallel &ndash; that is when the power supply is available - and islanded &ndash; when there is a cut - mode, isolating operations from power disturbances or failures.&ldquo;Earlier this month, there was a long power cut in parts of east and south Delhi due to a fire in a substation in Uttar Pradesh&rsquo;s Baghpat area. This system can come handy in such scenarios and the residents of the area, where BESS is available, can enjoy the continuous supply. Power outages can be prevented by a BESS unit like this one,&rdquo; said an official.The BESS will be charged during off-peak hours with surplus or low cost power available, which will be supplied (discharged) during time of peak power demand. Officials said this will help savings in power purchase costs by avoiding costly market purchase during the period of peak power demand.It will also integrate renewable energy and help the discom meet renewable power obligations. It will help BSES in &lsquo;greening-the-grid&rsquo; by adding flexibility to procure increased share of renewable energy.During peak hours, when the power load is maximum, the system will help avoid withdrawl from the grid, thereby avoiding overloading. &ldquo;For this very reason, it will be very useful in congested areas,&rdquo; said an official.",

            "articleBody": "Panaji: Several of the 350-odd consumers in Goa who have installed rooftop solar plants on their houses at their own cost and are eligible for a subsidy, can&rsquo;t find a way to get it, as the govt portal doesn&rsquo;t let the state electricity department grant the final approval for the same.&ldquo;People are facing this problem on and off, not just in Goa but across the country,&rdquo; said a senior govt official with knowledge of the subject. Explaining the issue, he said that there was a National Rooftop Solar portal, which was later migrated to the PM Surya Ghar portal. However, during the migration process, some issues cropped up on the new portal, resulting in the current hardships. &ldquo;We are in touch continuously with those managing the portal, and we hope the issue will be resolved soon,&rdquo; he said.Dabolim resident Sameer Pawar said that he installed a 5.5KW rooftop solar plant on his house, and that the plant was successfully commissioned last week. &ldquo;The inspiration for doing this came from the PM&rsquo;s vision for green and clean energy, and his Surya Ghar scheme. Even for a small household like mine, the return on investment does not really make sense, even with the promised state and central subsidy,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I want to highlight here that even though this scheme is being so proudly advertised and flaunted all over, the reality on the ground is that the national subsidy for rooftop solar plants is linked to processing of applications on the online portal, which has been dysfunctional for a long time, especially in Goa,&rdquo; he said.Pawar said that he has spoken to many officials from the state electricity department dealing with the matter, as well as with consumers who, for the past few months, have not been able to get the national subsidy since the Goa electricity department is unable to process the applications for approval online.",

As per L&amp;T's classification, the value of the significant contract lies between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 2,500 crore.  The power transmission and distribution vertical of L&amp;T has secured the order, the company said in a BSE filing.  The solar project at Kajra village in Lakhisarai district of Bihar will be a key element in the state's plans to harness renewable energy for sustainable energy solutions towards combating climate change and meeting demand growth.  The battery energy storage system will store solar energy during low-demand periods and discharge it when demand peaks.  In addition, it will help handle fluctuations in generation, provide frequency regulation, and support voltage. It comes with black start capability to the grid that will facilitate quick re-energisation after an outage.  Larsen &amp; Toubro is a USD 27 billion Indian multinational enterprise engaged in engineering, procurement and construction projects, hi-tech manufacturing and services, operating across multiple geographies.",

The memorandum was submitted by Odisha Deputy Chief Minister K V Singh Deo who attended the meeting of finance ministers of the states before the Union Budget. The meeting was chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi on Saturday. The Odisha government memorandum sought higher allocation under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SACI), 2024-25 to further accelerate infrastructure development, an official release said. Apart from the demand for the establishment of a second AIIMS at Sambalpur, the state government also sought expeditious completion of National Highways, specifically the Coastal Highway and Capital Region Ring Road (CRRR) projects, in Odisha. The new BJP government in Odisha also sought partial support from the Centre for the implementation of the 'Subhadra' scheme to promote women's welfare through entrepreneurship, ease of living, and dignity for them. As per the scheme, the state government would pay Rs 50,000 to every eligible woman. It was an election promise of the BJP in Odisha. It also asked for sanction of funds for construction of at least 5 lakh houses in rural and urban areas of Odisha under PMAY and support from the Centre for new city development and rapid urbanisation in the state. While addressing power sector issues through the inclusion of Odisha DISCOMs under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), the state wanted financial support for the adoption of new technologies such as green hydrogen, and central funding for green energy corridor projects in Odisha. \"The Union finance minister has assured to look into the demands raised by Odisha,\" the release issued by the chief minister's office said.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Signify's India market is becoming more important by the day, and it is evaluating the manufacturing capacity in the country under the China Plus-One strategy, a company official said. Signify India has started playing an important role not only in the domestic business but also in helping our global business to grow from India, said Sumit Joshi, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of Signify Innovations India.  The Indian market of Signify -- earlier known as Philips Lighting -- is playing a big role in the design and R&amp;D of Signify's global lighting business and as an ecosystem for electronic products as semiconductors are developed here, the manufacturing opportunity will become bigger.  \"India is a very very important market and I am saying obviously because of the domestic potential which we have... but I also think the role that India could play for the world for Signify is becoming far more important,\" Joshi told PTI.  Asked if Signify is looking as a manufacturing base for other global markets, he said, \"Over a period of time, I would want to see that India also starts playing a much bigger role in manufacturing.\"  \"Now with the China Plus One thinking, we are also evaluating as to what role can India play for the world in terms of manufacturing,\" he said.  The ecosystem required for electronics in the next 6-7 years is going to be far more developed. Presently, India does not have an ecosystem for crucial components such as semiconductors.  \"But now, that ecosystem is going to develop and I think there is a very serious attempt by the government and private players and make the electronics ecosystem much better,\" he said, adding, \"and once that happens, I think the role of manufacturing becomes much bigger\".  \"The (R&amp;D) transformation is happening, which I see in the next 5-7 years,\" Joshi said.  According to Joshi, the PLI scheme by the Indian government for LED light manufacturing was one of the most successful schemes in the last couple of years.  \"A lot of companies, including us, have used PLI to have more capital investment being put in,\" he said, adding that the industry is eagerly looking for the second tranche of the scheme, which may be announced in the upcoming Budget.  Signify has two R&amp;D facilities in India -- Noida and Pune -- an innovation lab in Bengaluru, and a manufacturing plant in Vadodara.  Brands such as Ecolink, which was developed in India for the affordable segment, have a presence in more than 15 countries. Signify exports to around 15 markets from India, he said.  About the Indian lighting industry, Joshi, a former president of Elcoma -- an association of lighting products manufacturers -- said it is moving towards connected lighting, which is expected to double in the next three years.  Currently, smart connected lighting are less than 10 per cent of the industry, while in the professional segment, it is higher around 20 per cent, Joshi said.  In the Indian lighting industry, the transformation to LED from CFL bulbs is almost complete and consumers are upgrading to smart connected lighting.  It is also seeing a good volume growth on the consumer part of the business as technology becomes cheaper and LED chips are getting far more efficient.  \"Now, the next stage of lighting that we are going to experience now, whether it is in the professional part as offices hospitality, healthcare or home, consumers are now going to move to something, which is much differentiated, better lighting, connected lighting, that's what we are seeing,\" he said.  Signify, a world leader in lighting, aspires to be net-zero by 2040 globally and it is ahead in the Indian market on the target, he said.  \"India has moved very well... our LED transformation in India happened with a lot of government initiatives,\" Joshi said, adding that this transition is helping India a lot in consumption of energy.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: As temperatures soar across regions experiencing heat waves, the efficiency of solar panels faces a consequential decline. Ideally suited to operate at around 25&deg;C, these panels experience a drop in efficiency as temperatures fluctuate above this mark. For a rise in temperature between 1&deg;C to 5&deg;C above the optimal temperature threshold, solar panel efficiency drops from 0.3 per cent to 1.5 per cent, experts told ETEnergyWorld. &ldquo;Heatwaves can significantly impact the efficiency of solar panels as they are designed to operate optimally between 15&deg;C and 35&deg;C, with peak performance at 25&deg;C,&rdquo; said Sharad Pungalia, managing director and chief executive officer, Amplus Solar.He said that higher temperatures increase the resistance within the solar cells, thus reducing the voltage and overall power output. &ldquo;Generally, a silicon solar panel&rsquo;s efficiency drops by 0.3 per cent to 0.5 per cent for each degree Celsius over 25&deg;C,&rdquo; said Ankush Malik, COO, Juniper Green Energy.Ashish Agarwal, head of solar business at BluPine Energy, a Gurugram-based renewable energy platform setup in India by Actis, said that heat waves result in higher temperatures with every 5&deg;C increase translating to a one per cent to 1.5 per cent loss in energy generation, leading to lower overall power generation during prolonged periods. According to Pungalia, prolonged exposure to high temperatures can also cause increased wear and tear, potentially leading to microcracks and other physical damage over time. These factors result in lower efficiency, posing economic and operational challenges for the project.In lower temperatures, solar panels are more effective in converting sunlight into electricity. High temperatures during heat waves cause solar cells&rsquo; thermal resistance to rise, which lowers voltage output and efficiency overall. Apart from this, experts said that there are financial implications of heatwaves on solar projects as well. While normal summer conditions are already accounted for in annual estimations, heatwaves negatively impact the efficiency of solar modules, leading to reduced energy generation and revenue loss. &ldquo;Extreme temperatures necessitate more frequent maintenance of components. Investments in technology and cooling systems to withstand higher temperatures further increases capital expenditure,&rdquo; said Pungalia.BluPine&rsquo;s Agarwal said that extreme heat can decrease worker productivity and slow down construction of solar projects. &ldquo;These delays can be costly, with estimates suggesting a one-month delay translates to a cost increase of about four lakhs per megawatt of solar capacity,&rdquo; he added.Apart from this, heat waves also pose health, safety, and environment challenges for solar project construction as well. Since solar farms are typically located in open, unshaded areas, extreme temperatures make it difficult for workers to perform their duties safely. &ldquo;This can lead to reduced productivity and project delays due to necessary adjustments like shifting work timing from 7 AM to 11 AM, with a break, and then resumes from 4 PM,&rdquo; said Agarwal.Malik said that the major challenges are reduced energy output, acceleration of material degradation, thereby shortening the lifespan of solar panels, and maintaining optimal temperatures may require additional cooling systems thereby raising operational costs.He added that fluctuations in energy output can challenge grid stability, particularly during peak demand periods coinciding with heat waves. Reduced efficiency and higher maintenance costs can delay the return on investment.",

The revised guidelines will specifically increase the production capacity of Green Ammonia to cater to the rising demand in the fertilizer sector.Initially, under the SIGHT Programme &ndash; Component II: Incentive for Procurement of Green Ammonia Production (under Mode2A) established on January 16, 2024, the capacity set for bidding was 550,000 tonnes per annum of Green Ammonia. However, due to increasing demand, MNRE has decided to raise the allocation to 750,000 tonnes per annum. This amendment aligns with the sector's growing needs and supports the broader objectives of the NGHM.The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) had earlier issued a Request for Selection (RfS) for the selection of Green Ammonia Producers through a cost-based competitive bidding process. This process is a cornerstone of the mission's strategy to foster a competitive and efficient market.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched on January 4, 2023, with an investment of Rs. 19,744 crores expected through to FY 2029-30, is pivotal to India&rsquo;s strategy for achieving energy self-reliance. The mission not only focuses on reducing the economy's carbon footprint but also aims to decrease dependency on fossil fuel imports, positioning India as a leader in Green Hydrogen technology and markets globally.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The National Capital Regional Transport Corporation (NCRTC) is making significant strides in renewable energy adoption by installing solar power infrastructure along the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS Corridor, officials said on Friday. The NCRTC generates three megawatt peak (MWp) in-house solar power leading to an annual reduction of 3,100 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, they said.  \"This initiative has transformed stations, depots and receiving substations into centres of clean and sustainable energy. Currently, NCRTC generates a three megawatt peak (MWp) of in-house solar power, leading to an annual reduction of 3,100 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission,\" a senior NCRTC official said.  The NCRTC's shift from conventional fossil fuel-based power to clean solar energy aligns with its vision of sustainability and operational efficiency. With a target of 11 MW solar power capacity, the NCRTC aims to save around 11,500 tons of CO2 emissions annually, marking a substantial step in combating climate change, the official said.  Solar power plants are now operational at the Sahibabad and Guldhar RRTS stations, each having a peak power capacity of 729 kilowatts (kWp), the Duhai RRTS station with 736 kWp as well as at the Duhai Depot and Duhai Depot station with capacities of 585 kWp and 108 kWp respectively, they said.  Additionally, the Murad Nagar Receiving Sub Station (RSS) with a capacity of 43 kWp and the Ghaziabad RSS with a capacity of 20 kWp also generate solar power, they said.  Solar power installation at other stations is currently underway. The solar energy generation at the plant is monitored through a 'cloud-based application', the officials said.  The Sahibabad, Guldhar and Duhai solar power plants, each having over 1,600 high-efficiency solar panels installed on the rooftop, are expected to generate more than 10 lakh units of electricity annually per station, significantly reducing electricity expenses, the official said.",

            "articleBody": "In a small boat bobbing in the waves between towering offshore wind turbines, researchers in Europe's Baltic Sea reach into the frigid water and remove long lines stretched between the pylons onto which mussels and seaweed are growing. It's part of efforts to explore multiple uses for remote wind parks far out at sea, such as fresh seafood production. Run by the Swedish state-owned power firm Vattenfall and Denmark's Aarhus University, the four-year project started in 2023 off the Danish east coast at Scandinavia's largest wind farm, Kriegers Flak. With its first harvest just 18 months later, it's already showing signs of early success. \"There's an increasing competition for space on land and in the sea,\" said Aarhus University senior scientist Annette Bruhn, who leads the project. \"We can, in one area, produce both fossil-free energy and food for a growing population.\" With a capacity of over 600 megawatts, Kriegers Flak can power up to 600,000 households. Its 72 turbines deliver clean energy to nearby Denmark and Germany to the south. But researchers saw other potential within the park's 132 square-kilometer (51 square-mile) area. The water between its spinning blades has been transformed into an experimental underwater seafood farm. Four hundred-meter (328-foot) lines spread between the turbines grow seaweed and mussel crops. The seaweed was recently harvested for the first time. \"Seaweed and mussels are low trophic aquaculture crops, which means that they can be produced without the use of fertilizers. They take up nutrients from the sea and produce healthy foods,\" Bruhn said. Recent Aarhus University modelling suggests tons of fresh seafood could be produced annually by utilizing just a tenth of Denmark's wind park area. Researchers say the benefits could go well beyond food production - mussel and seaweed crops could help improve water quality and capture carbon. \"These are non-fed crops that live from what they take up from the sea, they capture emissions instead of having emissions,\" Bruhn said. Researchers say now is the time to develop guidelines to encourage companies to plan for multiple uses of the ocean as European nations massively ramp up production of clean energy from wind turbines in the North Sea. In 1991, Denmark became the first country in the world to install a commercial offshore wind park. More than 30 years later, nearly half of the Danish electricity production derives from wind turbines. Driven to meet climate targets and reduce energy dependence on Russia, nine European countries, including Denmark, last year announced plans to quadruple current production to 120 gigawatts by the end of the decade, and move to 300 gigawatts by 2050. Vattenfall bioscience expert Tim Wilms said there's \"huge potential.\" \"We have so much untapped area within our turbines that is not being used,\" he said. \"In some areas, it makes a lot of sense to combine with sustainable food\" while in other areas \"we might look into offshore solar.\" A growing body of research shows that offshore wind farms can have both positive and negative impacts on local ecosystems. Offshore projects have been criticised for damage caused to the sea floor during construction, noise pollution and now debunked claims they caused whale deaths. Meanwhile, the large boulders laid at the base of the turbines to prevent erosion can also act as artificial reefs attracting more marine life and protect from large-scale fishing operations. Wilms said underwater surveys of older wind farms revealed structures \"completely transformed\", overgrown with different species. Liselotte Hohwy Stokholm, CEO of Danish think tank Ocean Institute, said more \"knowledge about multi-use\" developments was needed to understand how to combine human activities so that great areas of the ocean could become \"strictly protected areas.\" Currently, efforts are on a limited scale, but researchers hope to soon take their knowledge to the extreme conditions of the North Sea, eventually upscaling to commercial food production. \"It's very vital that we do it now because there's so many questions we still need to have answered before we can do this in the right way,\" said Bruhn.",

            "articleBody": "OSLO/PARIS: Europe has clocked a record number of hours of negative power prices this year due to a mismatch between demand and supply as solar power generation soars, potentially helping to shift investment to much needed storage solutions. Wholesale power markets in most of Europe's key economies turned out zero or negative prices for a record number of hours in the first five months of this year at times of low demand. That means producers more frequently have to pay to offload power, or stop their plants.  \"One could certainly say that, at this point, success is consuming its own offspring,\" Markus Hagel, energy policy expert at German utility Trianel, told Reuters. Strong hydro and nuclear power generation has played some part in the oversupply, but Europe has also seen a massive expansion of solar power. Installed solar capacity in the European Union more than doubled to 263 GW between 2019 and 2023, according to SolarPower Europe data. In 2023 alone, that is equivalent to an extra 306,000 solar panels being installed every day, the group said. In the day-ahead market, this has seen more European markets experience price drops at the lowest demand point in the middle of the day. Trianel told Reuters the company has invested in 800 megawatt (MW) of photovoltaic capacity and has a project pipeline of 2,000 MW but the lower prices are forcing it to reconsider how it sells the power. Solar has boomed in part because it no longer required subsidies as developers agreed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with buyers at fixed terms pegged to wholesale power market prices. This allowed for a faster and bigger build-out than previous capped volume auctions for government-backed payments. But as prices fall, developers are increasingly turning back to subsidy schemes again, Hagel said. Negative prices are nothing new for Germany, which hosts Europe's biggest capacity of volatile solar and wind power generation, but 2024 is the first year Spain is seeing them, after several years of strong solar power growth. \"It is not something that worries us at the moment. What does worry us is that it will be repeated or can be repeated over time,\" Jose Maria Gonzalez Moya, director general of renewable lobby APPA Renovables, said, adding that new contracts for PPAs are already declining. \"And yes, in a way, investment is slowing down. Not stopping, but slowing down,\" Moya said. Germany and Spain are still leading the PPA market, Jens Hollstein, head of advisory at PPA pricing platform Pexapark, said. However, solar producers were being forced to sell their power at increasing discounts to round-the-clock generators. \"The margin is getting thinner,\" Hollstein said. He expected a slowdown in investments if the development continued. On the flip-side, the power market is now seeing a bigger gap between low and high-priced hours, increasing the incentive to invest in storage, he added. INCREASING BATTERY STORAGE IS KEY The International Energy Agency (IEA) highlighted the urgent need for energy storage in an annual report. \"Developers who choose not to co-locate their wind and solar PV power parks alongside battery storage or other sources of flexibility may see a drop in potential revenues during peak generation - hampering profits and discouraging investment,\" the IEA wrote. The EU estimated that energy storage in the bloc will need to rise more than three-fold from 2022 to 2030, to match projections of a 69% share of renewable energy in its electricity system by then. Norwegian renewable energy producer Statkraft, which operates across Europe, has said it could divest some wind and solar projects, but would likely hold onto its battery assets. \"For batteries it will be positive to have greater volatility and also negative prices,\" CEO Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal said, as batteries can be charged when prices are low while output can be sold when prices are high. \"That is one of the reasons why flexible projects will be attractive,\" Ringstad Vartdal added. Besides storing energy in batteries to deal with periods of excess supply, other options like AI-powered smart grids and meters could also help consumers optimise their electricity use. Domestic end users, plagued by the surge in energy costs in the wake of the Ukraine war, have yet to enjoy lower bills because often they are locked into long term contracts. Only those consumers that have invested in a heat pump, a charger for their electric car, or a storage system, are able to benefit from negative prices, spokesperson for Germany's association of local utilities VKU said. Those on fixed priced contracts will only feel a positive impact from negative power prices once they have pulled down average market prices over the long term.",

To that end, the HPPCL has allotted the construction of three solar projects totalling 47 MW, the CM said in a statement. One of these projects has been completed, he said.  The foundation stone of the Pekhubela project was laid by Sukhu on December 2, 2023.  The plant started power generation on 15 April this year and was formally inaugurated today.  Sukhu said the project is expected to produce 6.61 crore units of electricity annually and Rs 19.17 crore in revenue for the state at a rate of Rs 2.90 per unit.  The project features 82,656 solar modules with electricity being transmitted through the Rakkad-Tahliwal transmission line.  The Pekhubela solar project is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 2,532 tonnes annually, according to the statement.  The HP government has invited tenders for seven additional solar projects with a combined capacity of 72 MW through HPPCL, it said.  Detailed project reports are being prepared for four solar power projects with a capacity of 54 MW, whereas pre-feasibility reports for ten solar power projects with a cumulative capacity of 77 MW are also in progress, it said.",

WHY IT'S IMPORTANTGrowth in solar and wind power pushed renewable generation to a record 30% of global electricity production in 2023, up slightly from 29.4% in 2022. Most of the addition came from China, a country EY sees as one of the leaders in renewable energy development, alongside the U.S. and Germany. A report by the International Energy Agency earlier this month, however, showed that climate plans taken up by different countries, besides 14 of a total of 194 nations, are not yet in line to meet the target. Investors face higher capital costs due to a steep interest rate environment. \"The sector should prepare for two or three years (at least) of more constrained financing and raised expectations from investors,\" EY stated. Battery energy storage systems could play a vital role in a more volatile grid, the report says. The deployment is forecast to quadruple to 572 gigawatts (GW) or 1,848 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by 2030, much of which would be adopted at grid-scale, it adds.  CONTEXTMore than 100 countries at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai last year had agreed to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 and cut down the use of fossil fuel and emissions, a move seen as vital to avert the worst effects of climate change. The pledge made at COP28 is one of the several energy-related announcements that include new measures and funding to combat methane emissions, agreements to cut coal use and nuclear energy promotion.

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: As midday will peak on the summer solstice today, 21 June 2024, 20 per cent of the world&rsquo;s electricity will come from solar, up from 16 per cent last year, according to energy think-tank Ember.Ember added that the US and India are expected to have a similar solar share in June 2024 at 6.9 per cent and 7.1 per cent, respectively, below the global average of 8.2 per cent. The share on average across 2023 was at 5.6 per cent in the US and 5.8 per cent in India.According to the think-tank, in June, global solar generation typically has a seasonally higher share due to the longer summer days in the northern hemisphere, where it estimates that 89 per cent of the world&rsquo;s solar panels are installed.&ldquo;The share of solar in total electricity generation will reach 8.2 per cent in June 2024, up from 6.7 per cent in June 2023. Across the whole of 2023, solar generated a record 5.5 per cent of global electricity,&rdquo; it said.It further added that China, which is the world&rsquo;s largest solar market, accounted for 36 per cent of global solar generation in 2023. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s share of solar in total electricity generation is expected to reach 9.6 per cent in June 2024, up from 7 per cent in June 2023. On average, for the year 2023, solar&rsquo;s share in China&rsquo;s electricity generation was 6.2 per cent,&rdquo; said Ember.&ldquo;Battery costs have collapsed, meaning solar power is already being used in the evening, not just in the daytime. Solar power is the fastest growing source of electricity and will undoubtedly rise to become the biggest source of electricity, and ultimately of energy,&rdquo; said Kostantsa Rangelova, electricity analyst at Ember.In the EU, solar share across June is expected to be more than double the global average at 20 per cent, up from 17 per cent in June 2023. On average, for the entire year 2023, the EU&rsquo;s solar share was 9.2 per cent. For Spain, which has one of the highest solar shares in the EU and the world, the share of solar in June 2024 is expected to be even higher at 30 per cent.Ember&rsquo;s analysis shows that there are now 34 economies that generated more than 10 per cent of their electricity from solar in 2023. Although China is by far the biggest installer of solar panels, its share in 2023 was well below this threshold, at 6.2 per cent. However, 66 per cent of countries still generate less than 5 per cent of their electricity from solar, including many with insolation above the global average. Considering the falling costs and increase in technological efficiency, solar is set to see increased adoption in these countries in the future.",

This innovative system is designed to convert agricultural residues like paddy straw from hydrophobic to hydrophilic states using a mechanical steam blast technique, which can reduce straw volume by as much as 85%. This not only simplifies transportation and digestion but also enhances the methane yield potential by 16-18% for paddy straw.Furthermore, the advanced digesters employed in these plants can complete a production cycle in just 20 days, significantly speeding up Bio-Gas production. This rapid turnaround is expected to greatly benefit India's pursuit of sustainable and efficient energy solutions.",

            "articleBody": "SYDNEY: The Australian government on Thursday granted Norwegian energy giant Equinor and Oceanex Energy a licence to study the feasibility of building a wind farm in waters off its east coast as it looks to boost clean energy projects. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the potential Novocastrian Wind project, more than 20 km (12.4 miles) offshore Newcastle in the state of New South Wales, could generate over 2 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, enough to power 1.2 million homes. If feasibility is proven, Oceanex, which has lined up Equinor as a partner, can apply for a commercial licence to build an offshore wind project, Bowen said. Australia is shaping up to be the next big market for offshore wind farms - which are much bigger and far more productive than onshore wind farms - after a law setting out a framework for their development was passed in November 2021. The feasibility licence allows developers to undertake environmental assessments and geotechnical surveys. The decision comes a day after the opposition Coalition on Wednesday proposed building seven nuclear plants to replace coal-fired power by 2050, in a country where nuclear power is currently banned. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the policy \"a recipe for an economic catastrophe\" that would raise costs for taxpayers. The Albanese-led centre-left Labor government has been looking to ramp up renewable energy projects to meet its net zero emission target by 2050 and replace coal-fired power. It is targeting 82% of power supply to come from renewables by 2030, but remains well short of the target, at around 40% now, even after pledging to underwrite new wind, solar and battery projects with more than A$40 billion ($26.7 billion). Last month, the government gave the go-ahead for six projects, including proposals by wind giants Orsted and Iberdrola, to study the feasibility of building wind farms off the state of Victoria. ",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) on Wednesday said it has entered into a joint venture with biofuels company GPS Renewables Pvt Ltd to foster sustainable energy solutions in India. \"This association will pave the way for the formation of a 50:50 joint venture company dedicated to advancing biofuel adoption across the country,\" the firm said in a statement.  The agreement was signed by Mainak Chakraborty, CEO &amp; co-founder of GPS Renewables and Santanu Gupta, ED (Alternative Energy) at IOC.  \"The joint venture will focus on integrating advanced biogas technologies to convert organic waste into compressed biogas (CBG), a cleaner and renewable energy source. This will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions while providing a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels,\" it said.  By leveraging their combined expertise, IOC and GPS Renewables aim to accelerate the deployment of Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) plants nationwide.  These initiatives complement IOC's long-term low-carbon development strategy and will help the firm achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2046.  CBG will help cut dependence on imported fossil fuels and support the rural economy by creating local employment opportunities.  While IOC is India's largest oil refining and fuel marketing company, GPS Renewables is a full-stack biofuels firm offering technology and project solutions for climate-positive biofuel projects.  Starting from captive biogas plants, GPS Renewables has scaled up to set up some of the world's largest CBG plants, including the flagship CBG plant in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.",

But if you add up all the pledges, they may come to 2.7 to 2.8 degrees centigrade. These are only pledges, who's even monitoring the action behind it.\"He also discussed TERI's evolution since its establishment in 1974, transitioning from a focus on energy and resource research to becoming a central player in international climate change debates. \"From 1974, a very different time, TERI was set up in the shadow of very fundamental, and seismic changes taking place in the whole energy market, globally,\" he said.Sinha stressed the urgency of accelerating the energy transition, linking it directly to reducing carbon emissions, which comprise 75 to 80 per cent of all global emissions. He added, \"We have a solution, mostly at hand, for how to decarbonize electricity, through the faster rollout of renewables.\"Sinha called on TERI to lead by example in driving the necessary changes to mitigate climate impacts and encouraged a more aggressive approach to policy and innovation.",

Sri Lanka's Adani Group renewable project entails two wind energy projects; a 250 MW in the northeastern district of Mannar and a 234 MW project at Pooneryn in the north. The total investment was to be USD 750 million. On Tuesday, a three-member bench of the apex court gave the prime minister, the Cabinet and the Adani Group three weeks to file preliminary objections to the rights petition against the project. An environmental rights group had claimed in court that a decision by the Cabinet to treat the Adani wind power project as a Sri Lanka-India government-to-government venture was illegal and that it would cause immense damage to the migratory bird population causing environmental hazards. They had also challenged the action by Minister of Environment Pavithra Wanniarachchi to exclude the Mannar district's Viddathalathivu area from being a forest reserve, an action taken to facilitate the project. The Sri Lanka government said the Adani group investment was vital to achieving its target of 70 per cent of its power needs to renewable energy sources by 2030. In May, the government approved a 20-year power purchase agreement with Adani Green Energy to develop 484-megawatt wind power stations in the northeast region.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The second Modi government had the right intentions in dealing with environmental degradation and climate change but there wasn't enough focus on implementation, top environmentalist Sunita Narain has said. In an interaction with PTI editors here, Narain said successive administrations have diluted the environmental clearance system to the extent it no longer works.  \"Overall, my assessment is that the government had the right words and the right intentions. If you look at the government's policies, you can't argue that anything was per se wrong. Renewable energy, drinking water, waste management... all were on the table. So you put the whole package together, it's all there. My assessment is that there wasn't enough focus on implementation,\" Narain said.  In its second term, the Modi government focused on several initiatives, including scaling up renewable energy, improving forest cover, combating desertification, reducing air pollution, conserving wetlands, providing potable piped drinking water to all households, and eradicating single-use plastics.  The Modi-led government - now in its third term -- also made significant amendments to forest, wildlife, and environmental laws in the last five years, some of which drew criticism from opposition parties and environmentalists.  According to Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), new imagination is required to advance key government programmes concerning the environment.  \"A lot of these programmes have reached a point where we have not been able to deliver the goods. If we take the question of cleaning up rivers, we haven't been able to clean our rivers. We are still in a situation where we are taking clean water from our rivers and giving back sewage.\"  She said governments should pursue development the old-fashioned way.  \"Development in the old-fashioned way was about learning from the ground, changing your approach, and then relearning. You come back, policy gets infused, you learn from it, and you do things differently. So, in this echo chamber, you cannot have imagination,\" said Narain.  She added that the government has \"closed its ability\" to listen to people and learn from what's happening on the ground, and stressed that gathering feedback is essential to infuse new imagination into its programmes.  \"It has closed its ability to listen. Every point or position which may not be agreeable becomes dissent,\" she said.  \"You're not an enemy of the state if you point out that the Ujjwala scheme, brilliant as it was, is not leading to the gains because women don't have the money to buy refills. It's something that everybody knew about two years ago, but if you discuss it, it becomes, 'Oh, but you're against the Ujjwala programme',\" Narain added.  The environmentalist said previous governments weren't courageous enough to take new ideas on board but were definitely more open to listening.  \"But if you ask me to compare this government to past governments in terms of environmental track record, I will tell you very clearly they are all both bad and good,\" Narain said.  She was also member of the government-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority from 2002 to 2020.  Asked how much time it will take India to have clean blue skies and rivers, she said it all depends on the government's ability to implement its projects and make some inconvenient decisions.  \"The environmental clearance system is not working either for the environment or for development. It is only working for a breed of consultants or auditors and others who look at projects and clear them. All governments have cleared projects, even the Congress government, the UPA government. All governments have progressively diluted the decision-making system, making it weaker and weaker. It makes no sense today,\" she said.  Narain claimed most environmental impact assessment reports are \"cut-and-paste documents\".  \"So all that process has been diluted. Today we know that document comes, there is a committee, faceless people, no accountability. They sit and decide on whether this project should be granted clearance or not. How do they grant it clearance? By making sure that it has 100 conditions which cannot be enforced. There is no system even to make sure that those conditions are actually enforced,\" she said.  Narain said the regional offices of the environment ministry responsible for ensuring compliance are understaffed.  \"They don't have the ability to go and even check whether that condition has been enforced or not. It's a system which is broken. The entire focus of the government for the last five years has been... let's speed up the process. I have no problem. Speeding up is good. Loss of time is bad for economics. Why would I want a three-year process to get clearances? The cost of the project goes up.  \"I want an effective, hard, tough decision-making process which balances the good versus the bad. The environmental clearance process was to bring a balance between environment and development. If you break down the process, you dilute the institutions, you make them spineless. You basically make it into a system which doesn't work,\" she said.  How did successive governments respond to climate and environmental protests over the years?  Narain said government processes have inbuilt ways of managing people's opinions so that they do not become protests.  \"You had a public hearing process. A public hearing was supposed to be broadcast and was supposed to be done in a way that you listen to people. Now those processes have been diluted. Even if people come and say... nobody listens to them, and the project is still cleared. If you listen to those views at that time, the issue does not become a point of conflict,\" she said.  \"Not everybody who comes to protest is a paid lackey of the competitor. I think this distrust has to be fixed because there are issues by which people are genuinely affected, and there need to be institutional processes to listen to them,\" the environmentalist said.",

            "articleBody": "India has been ranked 63rd on a global Energy Transition Index released on Wednesday by the World Economic Forum, which said the country has shown significant improvement across energy equity, security and sustainability. European nations dominated the top ranks with Sweden topping the index, followed by Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and France in the top five.  China was ranked 20th.  The improvement shown by India and some other developing countries such as China and Brazil assumes significance as 83 per cent of countries have moved backwards from last year in at least one of the three energy system performance dimensions -- security, equity and sustainability.  Taking note of various initiatives taken in India, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said the country is leading the way in creating outcomes that can be replicated elsewhere.  It said the governments can also consider creating awareness and policy interventions, such as guidelines for energy-efficient built infrastructure and incentives for retrofitting, to shape an enabling environment for accelerated adoption.  \"The developing world has an opportunity to rewrite the rules and show the way to successfully transform energy demand -- an example of reverse innovation is frugal, scalable innovation originating in developed countries and then scaled across the world,\" it added.  On the role of China and India, the WEF said that with roughly a third of the global population, these two countries will play a critical role.  \"Both have experienced progress in renewable energy buildout, energy access improvements and energy security. However, the phase-down trajectory of coal will be a major driver of emissions. Additionally, these countries are in a strong position for green tech manufacturing,\" the WEF said.  Globally, the report said the energy transition to a more equitable, secure and sustainable energy system is still progressing but has lost momentum in the face of increasing uncertainty worldwide.  While 107 of the 120 countries benchmarked in the report demonstrated progress on their energy transition journeys in the past decade, the overall pace of the transition has slowed and balancing its different facets remains a key challenge.  \"While innovation growth has slowed, countries like China and India are leading in developing new energy solutions and technologies,\" it added.  The WEF also lauded the strides made by India in its clean energy infrastructure, with renewable energy and biomass comprising 42 per cent of its power generation capacity, making it the fourth-largest renewables market globally.  With annual investments nearing USD 10 billion, India is driving the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the production of green hydrogen.  \"However, the significant dependence on coal in both China and India continues to be a major factor in their emission intensity,\" it said.  Emerging and developing Asia, including populous nations like India and China, showed an 8 per cent improvement in ETI scores over the past decade, mainly in reducing energy intensity.  The WEF also noted India's focus on leveraging energy for income generation and supporting microenterprises through the productive use of renewable energy sources.  \"There is also a strong emphasis on ensuring the affordability and economic viability of these solutions, underscoring India's commitment to promoting sustainable energy practices that benefit local communities and drive economic growth,\" it added.  India's per capita emissions, at 1.7 tonnes of CO2, are already 60 per cent lower than the global average of 4.4 tonnes of CO2 per capita.  \"However, there is still a need to decouple growth from energy demand. This requires significant investment in energy efficiency, particularly during the development of new infrastructure and manufacturing capacity,\" it said while noting that India has been taking multiple initiatives in this regard.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: California has long been the dominant player in the US solar sector, but its share of national solar electricity output has fallen from 100 per cent in 2003 to under 30 per cent last year, data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows. That rapid drop in California's solar power share reveals that other states have now built up substantial solar capacity footprints of their own, and are helping to drive the country's ongoing efforts to replace fossil fuels with cleaner energy. Below is a breakdown of solar capacity development and generation trends in key US states.  TOP 5 California remains the top state in terms of solar generation capacity, with just over 20,482 megawatts (MW) as of early 2024, according to the EIA and energy data platform Cleanview. That capacity sum is up by 44 per cent since 2020, and indicates that California's generators continue to build out clean capacity at a rapid pace. However, in terms of total clean electricity generation, California has lost the top spot to Texas, which has sharply increased both wind and solar output over the past five years. Between 2020 and early 2024, Texas boosted solar generation capacity by 12,579 MW, which is more than twice the capacity gains posted by California over the same time frame. In terms of total electricity generation, California produced a record 68,816 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity from solar assets in 2023, compared to Texas' 31,739 GWh, according to energy think tank Ember. Those totals equated to just over 28 per cent of California's total electricity output, and 5.82 per cent of total electricity production in Texas. Florida has the third largest solar capacity in the US as of early 2024, with 9,585 MW, while North Carolina (6,710 MW) and Nevada (4,815 MW) round out the top five solar producers in terms of generation capacity. Florida generated 6.76 per cent of its electricity from solar farms in 2023, while North Carolina generated 9.3 per cent and Nevada generated 26 per cent, Ember data shows. Collectively, the top 5 solar producers lifted solar capacity by 28,428 MW since 2020, and account for around 59 per cent of total national solar capacity, according to the EIA.  SECOND TIER SOLAR STARS Georgia, Arizona, Virginia, Colorado and Ohio have the next largest solar capacity footprints in the US Virginia brought on the largest volume of solar capacity within that second tier group since 2020 (2,433 MW), followed by Ohio's 2,049 MW. Those new capacity additions have catapulted Ohio from the 29th largest solar capacity base in 2019 to 10th largest as of early 2024, EIA data shows. Ohio also brought on the fourth largest amount of capacity (1,676 MW) nationally within the past year and looks primed to leap even higher up the capacity rankings, once the planned Oak Run solar project's 800 MW of further capacity is completed. In terms of the share of electricity generated by solar assets, Arizona ranked top among the second-tier producers, generating around 10 per cent of all electricity from solar sources last year. Colorado ranked second with 9 per cent, followed by Virginia (6.56 per cent), Georgia (6.09 per cent) and Ohio (1.32 per cent).  FAST GROWTH Outside of the top 10, several other states are also posting rapid growth in solar generation capacity. Utah, New York, New Mexico, Wisconsin and South Carolina are the next largest states by total installed solar capacity, and added an average of 900 MW of capacity since 2020. Wisconsin alone added 1,407 MW of capacity during that window, which helped solar boost its electricity generation share from 0.36 per cent in 2020 to 2.35 per cent last year. Utah generated nearly 14 per cent of its electricity from solar last year, while New Mexico sourced 8.2 per cent, New York 5 per cent and South Carolina 3.3 per cent. For the United States as a whole, solar power generated just under all utility-supplied electricity in 2023, according to Ember. But solar's share of daily generation can easily surpass 70 per cent in key markets such as California, especially during bright, sunny days. And with total solar generation capacity climbing sharply throughout the country, solar power's share of total electricity generation looks set to scale fresh record highs in 2024. By Gavin Maguire",

            "articleBody": "Ottawa: Canada has for the first time blocked a sale of stockpiled rare earth elements mined in its far north to a firm in China, which dominates the sector, a senior government source said Tuesday.But more such interventions could follow as Ottawa \"cracks down on Chinese investment in Canada's mining sector,\" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Australia's Vital Metals was planning to sell the minerals to China's Shenghe Resources, but Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson \"stepped in to facilitate a deal so that the materials could stay in Canada,\" the source said.The stockpile was sold instead for Can$3 million (US$2.2 million) to the Saskatchewan Research Council, which is constructing processing facilities.Canada views critical minerals as a matter of national security and a key part of its strategy to decarbonize its economy. Rare earth elements and other critical minerals such as lithium, cadmium, nickel and cobalt are essential components in electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines and other technologies.Investment and export restrictions were imposed targeting primarily China, which dominates the critical minerals sector, while billions of dollars in government incentives have aimed to hasten local mining and the construction of new battery plants, for example.In a statement, Wilkinson's office said Canada is \"taking steps to develop secure domestic critical minerals value chains to reduce foreign reliance.\"\"When it comes to financing questions from mining companies operating in Canada, the answer cannot simply be investment from Chinese state-owned industries,\" it said.Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne in 2022 ordered three Chinese resource companies to sell their stakes in Canadian critical mineral firms, after tightening investment rules.Earlier this year, Montreal-based SRG Mining touted a plan to redomicile to the United Arab Emirates to avoid Canadian scrutiny of a deal to sell a nearly 20 percent stake of the company to a Chinese firm.But it backed off the deal with Carbon One New Energy Group in March after a warning by Champagne not to seek to skirt the Canadian rules.Vital Metals' stockpile from its Nechalacho mine in the Northwest Territories was to have been processed at a planned facility of its own in Saskatchewan, but construction of the plant was halted after the company's Canadian unit filed for bankruptcy.",

            "articleBody": "Gautam AdaniNew Delhi: The Adani Group is focusing on making massive investments in the twin areas of energy transition and digital infrastructure, and the next decade will see the conglomerate invest over $100 billion dollars in the energy transition space, Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Group said today.Speaking at an infrastructure event organised by CRISIL in Mumbai, Adani said the company plans to further expand its integrated renewable energy value chain that today already spans the manufacturing of every major component required for green energy generation. \"We are confident that we will produce the world&rsquo;s least expensive green electron that will become the feedstock for several sectors that must meet the sustainability mandate. And to make this happen, we are already building the world&rsquo;s largest single site renewable energy park in Khavda, in the district of Kutch,\" he said. The project will generate 30 GW of power at a single location, taking the company's total renewable energy capacity to 50 GW by 2030.\"It is anticipated that by the year 2030, the world will need 100 to 150 GW of additional green energy just for the AI data centres. We already have India&rsquo;s largest order book for data centres and are now in discussions for additional gigawatt-scale green AI data centres which we are uniquely positioned to deliver,\" Adani said.He also said that the global energy transition market was valued at around 3 trillion dollars in 2023 and is expected to grow to nearly 6 trillion dollars by 2030, and thereafter double every 10 years till 2050.\"India aims to install 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This ambitious target will require annual investments of over 150 billion dollars,\" Adani said, adding that the energy businesses that helps to enable this transition will also create opportunities to monetize carbon credits. Adani said that by the end of 2031-32, the year India has targeted to become a 10 trillion-dollar economy, the cumulative spend on infrastructure will exceed 2.5 trillion dollars.He said that he consider the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) program, that has earmarked a projected investment of Rs 111 lakh crore over the period 2020-25, as a benchmark of how the government can put in place a national view of over 9,000 infrastructure projects across sectors like energy, logistics, water, airports, and social infrastructure.",

            "articleBody": "MELBOURNE: Australia's main opposition party on Wednesday announced plans to build Australia's first nuclear power plants as early as 2035, arguing the government's policies for decarbonizing the economy with renewable energy sources including solar, wind turbines and green hydrogen would not work. The policy announcement ensures the major parties will be divided on how Australia curbs its greenhouse gas emissions at elections due within a year. The parties haven't gone to an election with the same carbon reduction policies since 2007. \"I'm very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward,\" opposition leader Peter Dutton told reporters. Seven government-owned reactors would be built on the sites of aging coal-fired electricity plants in five of Australia's six states, Dutton said. The first two would be built from 2035-to-2037 and the last in the 2040s. The estimated costs would be announced at a later date, he said. The current center-left government has rejected nuclear power generation in Australia as too expensive. Too many coal-fired generators would have been decommissioned before nuclear power could fill the gap. Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen accused the conservative opposition Liberal Party of serving Australia's influential coal and gas industry lobbies. \"It's not really an announcement. We know that Mr. Dutton wants to slow down the rollout of renewables and he wants to introduce the most expensive form of energy that's slow to build,\" Bowen told reporters. \"But today, we've seen no costs, we've seen no gigawatts, we've seen no detail. This is a joke. It's a serious joke because it threatens our transition\" from fossil fuels, Bowen added. Bowen's Labor Party came to power in the 2022 elections promising deeper cuts to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 than the previous coalition government had committed to. The previous Liberal Party-led government promised to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Labor promised a 43% reduction and the Parliament enshrined that target in law, creating difficulties for any future government that wanted to reduce it and offering certainty for investors. Dutton has ruled out announcing a new 2030 target before the next election. But the major parties have agreed on a net-zero emissions target by 2050. Dutton said Labor could not reach its 2030 target with a policy toward relying solely on renewable energy. A Liberal Party-led government would use nuclear power, renewable energy sources and \"significant amounts of gas,\" Dutton said. \"I want to make sure that the Australian public understands today that we have a vision for our country to deliver cleaner electricity, cheaper electricity and consistent electricity,\" Dutton said. Australia has historically been one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis because of its heavy reliance on abundant reserves of cheap coal and gas. Constant conflict between the major parties over the past 17 years on how to reduce emissions led to a carbon tax introduced by a Labor Party government in 2012 being repealed by a Liberal Party-led government in 2014. Australia's only reactor has produced nuclear isotopes for medical use in the Sydney suburb of Lucas Heights since 1958. Dutton said the country could only now consider introducing atomic power generation because the major parties had agreed in 2019 to the AUKUS partnership with the United States and Britain which will deliver Australia a fleet of submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: China's heavy spring rains have enabled the country to use its massive cascade dams more fully, boosting hydroelectric output sharply and reducing the need for coal-fired generation in May. Hydroelectric generation surged to 115 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in May 2024, up from 82 billion kWh in the same month last year, when a prolonged drought lowered river levels. Hydro generation was the second highest for the time of year in the last decade and not far below the record 122 billion kWh following heavy rainfall in the spring of 2022. The centrepiece of the system is a series of six enormous cascade power stations, stretching 1,800 kilometres (1,118 miles) along the Yangtze, with 110 individual generators and a combined maximum output of 72 million kilowatts (kW). Stations at Wudongde, Baihetan, Xiluodu, Xiangjiaba, Three Gorges and Gezhouba can meet the annual electricity needs of 54 million people and save up to 15 million metric tons of coal if fully utilised, according to Xinhua. But prolonged drought between the middle of 2022 and the end of 2023 meant generation was sharply reduced, including at the newly finished Baihetan, the world's second largest hydroelectric project. Since the start of April, however, spring rains across southern China have been heavier than average, swelling river volumes and enabling much more use to be made of hydro stations. The system is bracing for the imminent arrival of even heavier rainfall in July and August during the wet phase of the East Asian Monsoon. If monsoon rainfall is average or higher, generation is likely to set a record this summer, surpassing the previous high four years ago, given the massive expansion of capacity since 2020. In 2020, China had installed 370 million kW of hydroelectric capacity and generated a record 1,214 billion kWh over the year. By 2024, capacity had climbed by 14% to 423 million kW, creating potential to set a new record.  Chartbook: China hydro generation  In May, China also generated record amounts of electricity from wind and solar farms, as a result of the deployment of additional generating capacity over the last two years. Wind generation increased to 77 billion kWh from 74 billion kWh in May 2023 and 59 billion kWh in May 2022, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics. In the same month, solar generation soared to 36 billion kWh from 24 billion kWh a year ago and 21 billion kWh in 2022. Increases from hydro (+33 billion kWh), solar (+12 billion kWh) and wind (+3 billion kWh) last month were more than enough to meet consumption growth while diminishing the need for thermal power (-17 billion kWh). As a result, thermal generation, mostly from coal-fired units, declined to 454 billion kWh in May 2024 from a seasonal record 471 billion kWh in May 2023. Lower coal combustion means lower carbon dioxide emissions - helping progress towards the government's target of emissions peaking before 2030. But most of the country's major potential hydro sites have been developed so further increases in generation are likely to be limited. Longer term progress towards peaking emissions will depend on growth in wind, solar and nuclear, as well as policies to increase energy efficiency and dampen load growth.By John Kemp",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India and the US must remain at the forefront of developing critical technologies as part of a larger strategic interest, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said on Tuesday in presence of his American counterpart Jake Sullivan. Doval's comments came a day after he and Sullivan unveiled a raft of transformative initiatives to deepen India-US cooperation in areas of artificial intelligence, semiconductor, critical minerals, advanced telecommunication and defence space. \"The US and India have got to remain at the forefront of technology in case we need to protect and defend our value systems and it is part of a larger strategic interest,\" Doval said. The National Security Advisor (NSA) was addressing the iCET (India-US initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology) industry roundtable hosted by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The iCET was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden in May 2022 with an aim to forge greater collaboration between India and the US in areas of critical technologies. On Monday, Doval and Sullivan carried out a comprehensive review of the implementation of iCET during a meeting. In his remarks at the CII event, Doval highlighted the role of industry in technology and the progress of iCET since its inception, according to a CII statement. \"iCET has achieved more than we could imagine,\" Doval said, highlighting the progress made across the defence innovation roadmap and startups, and emphasised the importance of the semiconductor industry. In his address, Sullivan noted three important buckets for technology partnerships, the first being innovation, the second as production, and the third being deployment. The top Biden administration official highlighted the importance of innovation and emphasised the need for government support for the private sector. There exists bipartisan support for Indian industry in the US, he said adding that building the ecosystem and supply chain is the key to production. Sullivan said that the core of iCET is about the idea of India and US being able to support each other and to encourage greater collaboration in the technology ecosystem, jointly innovate and find solutions to challenges. Both the NSAs assured the industry that they welcome industry highlighting specific issues and due diligence will be done to resolve any barriers which hold back deeper and closer India US ties. The Initiative for iCET represents a landmark agreement between the two countries on emerging technologies such as AI, semiconductors, biotech, and defense innovation. On Monday's meeting on iCET between Doval and Sullivan, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said both sides took stock of the \"significant strides\" made by India and the US toward deepening and expanding strategic cooperation across key technology sectors including space, semiconductors, advanced telecommunications, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, critical minerals and clean energy. \"They also recognized the immense potential that is yet to be explored and harnessed in terms of deeper technology cooperation between the two countries in these sectors,\" it said in a statement on Tuesday. It said both sides discussed the way forward to further facilitate mutual collaboration and address outstanding barriers in trade, technology, and industrial cooperation. The CII roundtable brought together industry leaders from both countries, as India and the US seek to mobilize private sector investment and partnerships across strategic technology sectors. The US industry had representation from Thayer Mahan, General Atomics, Jeh Aerospace, Holtec, Cummins, Alsym Energy and Axiom Space. Indian industry leaders included representatives from 3rdiTech, BHEL, Bharat Forge, Bharti Airtel, Bhukhanvala Industries, Centum Electronics, L&amp;T, Tata Advanced Systems, Tata Power and Tejas Network. \"The industry enlightened the NSAs on their experiences thus far in terms of their bilateral collaboration, their vision on how to take the collaboration forward, and specific areas where government facilitation can play a key role in addressing particular barriers to unshackle further collaboration,\" according to the MEA. Chandrajit Banerjee, the director general of CII, stated that under iCET India and US are working on sectors such as AI, biotech, critical materials and minerals, semiconductors among others to help enable deeper engagement between the two nations. Sullivan visited Delhi from June 17 to 18, in the first trip to India by a senior Biden Administration official after the Modi government came to power for the third term. The US National Security Adviser was accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior US government officials and industry leaders. Sullivan's visit to India came three days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden had a brief conversation on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy's Apulia region.",

The summit, supported by government and private partners, also featured pitches from 10 other climate action startups in India that are generating revenue and ready to scale their solutions.  \"We aim to catalyze USD100 million in investments into Indian climate tech startups on behalf of individual and angel syndicate investors by 2030,\" said Priya Shah, general partner at Theia Ventures, a seed-stage climate tech fund. Theia is the investment partner for SusCrunch 2024.  Gagan Agarwal, founder of Planet Electric, unveiled high-performance electric trucks at the event, while Kuldeep Jain, founder and managing director of CleanMax, shared insights about building a large renewable energy company in India.  The summit also marked the graduation of the first cohort of SusVentures, a SusMafia program in collaboration with the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS Pilani) mentoring early-stage climate entrepreneurs.  In the first batch, 48 student entrepreneurs from BITS campuses built 14 startups in sectors like circular economy, energy efficiency and electric vehicles.  Five student startups mentored by SusMafia were showcased, including AgriVolt (agri-voltaics for industries), Positive Zero (software for sustainable fashion brands), JouleLess (wireless IoT devices) and SwiLato (an app to reduce vehicle emissions).",

High capital costs and network gridlock are major obstacles that could hinder necessary acceleration.The report emphasized the pivotal role of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in overcoming these challenges, particularly in mature markets where network gridlock has become acutely problematic. According to EY, BESS is crucial for stabilizing and strengthening grid infrastructure and enabling more distributed energy resources to connect.Arnaud de Giovanni, EY Global Renewables Leader, underscored the importance of scaling up BESS capabilities. \"Scaling up battery energy storage systems can help solve multiple problems holding up clean energy progress,\" said Giovanni. He highlighted four key areas for investors to focus on: building a resilient investment case, maintaining technology competitiveness, establishing the optimal business model or financing structure, and mitigating supply chain risks.The RECAI also introduced a new ranking for global markets based on their attractiveness for BESS investment. The United States, bolstered by a 30% tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, ranked first. China and the United Kingdom followed, benefiting from strong government support and advanced energy market designs, respectively.Ben Warren, EY RECAI Chief Editor, noted the rising interest and complexity in BESS investments. \"Investor interest in BESS is on the rise,\" Warren commented, adding, \"BESS investments are a long-term commitment; they are also highly localized and carry more risk than some other clean energy investments.\"EY projects a fourfold increase in global BESS deployment from 2023 to 2030, reaching 572 GW/1,848 GWh, highlighting the growing role of energy storage in the dynamic energy sector.",

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sudden drop in Russian fossil fuel exports to Germany, Berlin has introduced several pieces of legislation to accelerate solar power expansion, part of Berlin's plan to cover 80 per cent of its energy needs from renewables by 2030 and to become climate neutral by 2045. New solar power capacity grew by more than five gigawatts (GW) in the first third of this year, as 56 per cent of businesses and over 60 per cent of real estate owners in Europe's biggest economy are interested in investing in solar power systems, BSW said, citing a May survey by YouGov. BSW said it expects a double-digit percentage growth in installations and solar storage capacity in 2024, meeting the government targets of 19 GW of new annual capacity to reach 215 GW, or 25 per cent of its domestic electricity consumption, by 2030. In the first four months of this year, newly installed photovolatics capacity on commercial rooftops rose by 81 per cent while solar installations on open spaces grew by 74 per cent compared to the same period last year. In the residential sector, new installations rose by 1 per cent. \"Following a significant solar boom in Germany's residential areas, commercial rooftops and underperforming open spaces are now being electrified with solar technology,\" BSW head Carsten Kornig said in a statement.

            "articleBody": "MENOKEN: Some day, the passenger jets that soar 35,000 feet (10.6 kilometers) over Dan McLean's North Dakota farm could be fueled by corn grown on his land and millions of other acres across the Midwest. It's a vision the US airline industry embraces and agricultural groups see as a key to ensuring strong future sales of ethanol, a fuel that consumes more than one-third of the nation's corn crop and offers a cleaner-burning alternative for the nation's airlines. But making that dream a reality hasn't been easy, in part because even as farmers would benefit from a huge new market for corn, the plan relies on federal tax credits triggered by capturing carbon dioxide at refineries and then moving the gas hundreds of miles through pipelines that would snake across the Midwest, including beneath farmers' fields. Some of those farmers, along with environmentalist and property rights groups, have gone before regulatory authorities in several Midwest states to oppose the lines, and frequently they have succeeded in at least slowing the process. A key decision is expected soon in Iowa. \"This whole thing is private industry -- rich private industry -- getting tax money, strictly tax money to bury this stuff,\" said McLean, who opposes a line that would cross his farmland east of Bismarck. \"That tax money is coming out of everybody's pocket, and they're going to walk away from it, and we're going to be left with a big poisonous pipe running across the country.\"  Supporters have faced such criticism for years as they seek approval of pipelines and tax credits. The credits would mean profits for refineries and help make the cost of the new fuel competitive with traditional jet fuel. But opponents see the pipelines as an expensive and potentially dangerous effort that tramples on property rights and fails to reduce greenhouse gases.  Gaining approval of pipelines has proved arduous. Several companies have dropped their pipeline plans in the face of opposition and delay. The leading remaining company is Summit Carbon Solutions, which is seeking to build a 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) pipeline system through five Midwestern states - North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa - with carbon dioxide emissions ultimately buried underground in North Dakota.  North Dakota regulators last year denied a siting permit for Summit but later agreed to reconsider. South Dakota regulators in September rejected Summit's application, but company officials said they would file again. Summit must seek approval from individual counties in Nebraska, and one county earlier this year denied a permit. In Minnesota, regulators are doing an environmental review with future hearings planned. An upcoming decision by the Iowa Utilities Board about whether to grant a pipeline permit and approve Summit's eminent domain requests will be key to the larger effort throughout the Midwest. Iowa is the nation's leader in corn and ethanol production. To the renewable fuels industry, failure to gain approval of the pipelines could jeopardize a giant new aviation fuel market they believe would continue decades into the future, even as electric vehicles gradually replace gas-powered cars and traditional vehicles get more efficient. \"There's a lot at stake here. We have a market that we can open up that can really underpin rural prosperity for the next two or three decades,\" said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. Essential to their efforts is a complicated formula that regulators established to approximate how much each ethanol plant contributes to global warming. Ethanol production already produces less carbon than gasoline production, but the industry must reduce that further to qualify for tax credits that require biofuel have a carbon score at least 50 per cent lower than gasoline. The Treasury Department recently tweaked that formula, taking into account the role farming practices, like planting cover crops and using no-till techniques, play in reducing carbon production. However, the rules require farmers to take all those steps so it will still likely be hard for ethanol to qualify without either carbon pipelines or a combination of several other expensive measures, like ensuring an ethanol plant is powered by renewable energy or biogas.  That's why many in the biofuels industry argue that carbon capture pipelines are the best option to obtaining tax credits. Without the sustainable aviation fuel market, Shaw and others contend corn prices could ultimately collapse in future years as demand from motorists wanes.  Currently, the roughly 200 US ethanol plants have the capacity to produce 18 billion gallons of ethanol annually, though some are idle so the industry produces about 15 billion gallons a year, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Passenger jets now burn about 25 billion gallons a year and that is expected to grow to 35 billion gallons annually by 2050. And whereas most gasoline is now blended with 10 per cent ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel would use a 50 per cent blend of ethanol. It also requires about 1.7 gallons of ethanol for every gallon of jet fuel. \"We refer to carbon capture and sequestration as the key that unlocks the sustainable aviation fuel market,\" Shaw said. Ethanol trade groups estimate that federal tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel, combined with the existing credit for renewable fuels, can provide between $1.85 and $2.25 per gallon depending on the carbon intensity of the each ethanol plant. California, Minnesota and Illinois also have separate tax credits that can be added to the federal credits for fuel sold in those states. With one of the biggest state tax credits of $1.50 in Minnesota or Illinois, some sustainable aviation fuel could receive nearly $4 per gallon in tax credits. There is also a separate federal tax credit available for carbon sequestration but the rules won't allow producers to claim it simultaneously with the main federal credit for sustainable aviation fuel, resulting in a smaller total tax credit. The biggest ethanol trade groups - the Renewable Fuels Association and Growth Energy - say all tax credits combined would help make sustainable aviation fuel competitive with traditional jet fuel that has been selling for about $2.5 to $3 a gallon. And costs could drop if ethanol plants start producing the jet fuel on a large scale. One small plant in Georgia is now producing 10 million gallons a year of sustainable aviation fuel from ethanol, but Geoff Cooper, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said he expects the industry's capacity to grow over the next five years to close to 800 million gallons annually.  Agricultural economists have estimated farmers would receive about $441 million more by 2050 if sustainable aviation fuel boosts ethanol demand from the current current 15 billion gallons to 28.5 billion gallons.",

It is a basic principle of respect between countries and therefore they must remove those solar panels as soon as possible or we are going to do it,\" Boric told reporters during a visit to Paris.Chile and Argentina share a border of about 5,000 kilometers (more than 3,000 miles).",

            "articleBody": "Australia extracts 52% of the world's lithium, the vast majority of it exported as an ore to China for eventual refining and use in batteries, notably in China's world-dominant electric vehicle industry.Premier Li Qiang toured a Chinese-controlled lithium refiner in Perth on Tuesday, a sign of his country's vast appetite for Australian \"critical minerals\" essential to clean energy technologies.Li ended his four-day fence-mending visit to Australia by stopping in at Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia, a 51-percent Chinese-owned venture comprising a mine for hard rock lithium ore, and a lithium refinery.Along with at least a dozen other officials, China's second most powerful man donned a white helmet during a rainy visit to the facility south of Perth in resource-rich Western Australia.Australia extracts 52 per cent of the world's lithium, the vast majority of it exported as an ore to China for eventual refining and use in batteries, notably in China's world-dominant electric vehicle industry.But despite being a huge Australian customer, China's involvement in the country's critical mineral industry is sensitive because of its dominance of global supply chains.Australia has only recently begun refining lithium rather than exporting the ore.And the government has announced a strategic plan to develop new supply chains with friendly countries for critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and so-called rare earths.Earlier this year, the government ordered five China-linked shareholders to sell off a combined 10 per cent stake in Northern Minerals, a producer of the rare earth dysprosium.National security threatsSuch foreign ownership was against Australia's \"national interests\", Treasurer Jim Chalmers said.About 99 per cent of the world's dysprosium -- used in high-performance magnets -- is currently produced in China.China has invested in critical minerals in Latin America, Africa and Australia over the past 10-20 years, said Marina Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.Developing supply chains independent of China is \"fine and dandy\" but unlikely to be achieved even in the short to medium term, she said.\"We are facing a very time-pressing issue that is fighting against climate change -- so that issue should be at the centre of the discourse,\" Zhang said.\"But unfortunately the Western allies are taking the approach that China's dominance across the supply chains of critical minerals is imposing national security threats,\" she said.China's narrative, however, was that it was investing and making a contribution to sustainability and environmental protection, the analyst said.The Chinese premier's agenda included a visit to a private research facility for clean energy-produced \"green hydrogen\" -- touted as a fuel of the future to power heavy-duty items such as trucks and blast furnaces.Kicking your customersThe research centre in eastern Perth is owned by a renewable energy arm of Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue metal mining group.Forrest welcomed the resolution of a diplomatic spat that sparked Chinese trade sanctions against a slew of Australian exports in 2020. China's trade measures have recently been largely dismantled.\"Any government of Australia which goes out of its way to annoy its biggest customer is probably going to stop being that customer's favourite supplier,\" Forrest told The Australian in an interview ahead of the visit.\"You can't run around kicking your customers and still expect to sell a lot of boots.\"",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Investments in India&rsquo;s key infrastructure sectors &mdash; renewable energy and roads &ndash; and real estate are expected to grow 38 per cent in fiscals 2025 and 2026 compared with the previous two fiscals to Rs 15 lakh crore, according to research agency CRISIL Ratings.It said that the surge will ride on India&rsquo;s need for creation of sustainable infrastructure by adding more green power to the energy mix, improving physical connectivity through a denser road network, as well as rising demand for residential and commercial real estate.&ldquo;The underlying demand drivers in these three sectors remain strong, with regular policy interventions fuelling investor interest. This has also supported healthy credit risk profiles of private players and strengthened their execution and funding capabilities,&rdquo; said Krishnan Sitaraman, senior director and chief ratings officer, CRISIL Ratings.The research firm noted that for renewables, the key growth driver is demand for sustainable energy transition. &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s target is driving up auctions, which has created a strong pipeline. India saw auctions of 35 GW in fiscal 2024, the highest ever in a single fiscal, resulting in a strong pipeline of 75 GW. This will primarily drive implementation of 50 GW capacity over the next two fiscals,&rdquo; it added.In the roads sector, the need for improved physical connectivity, which helps in efficiency gains for the economy, has driven healthy awarding over the past few fiscals years, barring the last one. Strengthened order books of road developers, at 2.5 times of revenue, will support 11 per cent growth in highway construction, which is seen at 12,500 km per year over the next two fiscals years. CRISIL highlighted that for real estate, net leasing of commercial office space will see demand growth of 8-10 per cent this fiscal and the next. &ldquo;The primary drivers of the same will be global capability centres eyeing India&rsquo;s large talent pool and competitive rentals, as well as healthy demand from domestic sectors. Demand growth for residential real estate will sustain at 8-12 per cent this fiscal and the next, aided by favourable affordability and premiumisation,&rdquo; it added.It said that the growth momentum in these three sectors is expected to be further aided by policy enablement, which has reduced risks.&ldquo;For renewables, higher import duties have enabled a domestic ecosystem for module production. This not only resulted in import dependence and price volatilities but also facilitated better control on supply-chain,&rdquo; it added. In roads, too, the confidence of the private sector has been boosted through the hybrid annuity model (HAM) and improvement in concession agreements, with more-equitable risk sharing between developers and concessionaires. HAM provides upfront right-of-way and provision for descoping and delinking, mitigating some of the key execution risks.CRISIL further added that residential real estate has also seen supportive policy interventions, the key being the implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, which has improved transparency and enabled timely completion of projects, thus enhancing stakeholder confidence. &ldquo;Regular policy interventions in these sectors have also increased investor interest, thus providing opportunities to developers to unlock equity capital. Cumulatively ~Rs 2 lakh crore of equity capital has been deployed in these sectors over the past two fiscals driven by strong investor participation,&rdquo; said Manish Gupta, Senior Director and Deputy Chief Ratings Officer. He added that a key enabler here has been the emergence of vehicles such as infrastructure investment trusts and real estate investment trusts. The capital inflows from investors have helped improve credit profiles of private players, thus strengthening their ability to fund future growth.That said, there are some risks to watch out for as the growth momentum could be impacted if these play out in a meaningful way.In renewables, timely commissioning of storage and storage-linked capacities6 remains a key risk given their higher tariffs compared with the usual renewable capacities. These storage-linked capacities have so far had low traction on the ground in finding off-takers, with nearly 7 GW of the ~9 GW projects yet to find buyers.In real estate, while reduction in inventory in recent years has added to the resilience of the sector, discipline in new launches and, consequently, the impact on inventory going ahead will remain monitorable.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Top executives of the renewable energy industry believe the transition under the new minister Pralhad Joshi would be smooth and represents a pivotal moment for the clean energy sector in India, but he would need to ensure that policy continuity is exercised to reinforce investor confidence and drive advancements.With the appointment of key ministers in the new Cabinet, Prahlad Joshi, formerly the minister of coal, assumed office as the new and renewable energy minister on 12 June.&ldquo;This is a smooth transition. To accelerate clean energy deployment at the pace needed to meet the 2030 targets, the renewable energy sector will need strong alignment between the Centre and the states and also between different parts of the central government,&rdquo; Sumant Sinha, founder, chairperson and chief executive officer, ReNew, told ETEnergyWorld.He added that the new government will continue its focus on achieving the target of 500 GW by 2030, catalyzing growth of the green hydrogen industry and boosting domestic manufacturing. &ldquo;India&rsquo;s energy demand is set to continue to soar in the coming years, and ramping up the share of renewables in the energy mix will remain an important policy goal for our energy security,&rdquo; said Sinha.Kailash Tarachandani, CEO, Inox Wind, is optimistic that the new leadership will bring renewed vigor to accelerate the adoption and integration of renewable energy in India. However, there are several expectations tied to the new regime that could substantially benefit the renewable energy sector.&ldquo;These include extension of ISTS waiver, incentives for green power consumption, accelerating transmission infrastructure development, state-level policy and regulation alignment, among others,&rdquo; Tarachandani told ETEnergyWorld. Elaborating on each aspect, he said that when it comes to ISTS waiver, extending it for renewable projects beyond June 2025 would be a significant step in supporting the sector's growth.While it would be beneficial if the government announces schemes to incentivise green power consumption among retail consumers, encouraging wider adoption of renewable energy.On accelerating transmission infrastructure development, he said, &ldquo;While the planning and development of transmission infrastructure by CEA and Power Grid have improved, it still falls short of meeting the national targets for new renewable energy capacities. A more integrated alignment with developers and stakeholders is essential.&rdquo;On state-level policy and regulation alignment, he added that they are looking forward to such policies becoming more proactive in aligning with the Green Energy Open Access Rules 2022. &ldquo;States should be encouraged to provide banking facilities at nominal charges and limit levies such as cross-subsidy and additional surcharges to promote new green energy projects,&rdquo; he said.Regarding distributed grid substations, he said that setting up more distributed grid substations and associated lines of smaller capacities in high-yield areas could reduce the need for extensive 33 KV and 220 KV lines. &ldquo;This would allow projects to be built closer to grid substations, enhancing efficiency,&rdquo; he added.He further said that the government should introduce schemes and incentives that promote research and development, which would improve technology, resulting in higher wattage solar panels, higher megawattage wind turbines, and ultimately reducing per unit generation costs and improving efficiency.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The DERC has released its draft regulations for renewable purchase obligation (RPO), mandating a 29.91 per cent green energy purchase this year for all stakeholders, including discoms, officials said on Monday. RPOs mandate all electricity distribution licensees to purchase energy from renewable sources.  The Draft Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (Renewable Purchase Obligation and Renewable Energy Certificate Framework Implementation) Regulations, 2024 has been issued by the DERC, which is seeking public comments till July 2, they said.  Under the draft regulations released by the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC), all stakeholders including discoms, must comply with specified RPO targets as a percentage of their total annual consumption.  The DERC has specified an RPO target of 29.91 per cent for 2024-25 and 30.01 per cent for 2025-26, as per the draft regulation.  Non-compliance of the RPO targets will result in a penalty of 10 paise per unit for all obligated entities, officials said.  The distributed RPO targets are in line with the Ministry of Power's notification under Section 14 of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, dated October 20, 2023. Distributed RPO can be met through solar rooftop net metreing installations, officials said.  The RPOs comprise wind, hydro and other sources of renewable energy.  Eligible consumers can choose green power from several sources, such as purchasing from power exchange through open access, requisitioning from discoms, from captive power plants, purchasing renewable energy certificates, self-generation, among others, they said.",

            "articleBody": "MELBOURNE/RIO DE JANEIRO: Mining giant Brazil has big ambitions to build a rare earths industry as Western economies push to secure the metals needed for magnets used in green energy and defence and break China's dominance of the supply chain. Working to its advantage are low labour costs, clean energy, established regulations and proximity to end markets, including Latin America's first magnet plant which would provide a ready buyer for the metals. But low rare earths prices, technical challenges and nervous lenders pose challenges to the Latin American nation's hopes to propel itself into the world's top five rare earths producers. The pace at which Brazil's rare earths projects come together will be a test for how successful the West may be at building a new advanced industry almost from scratch to break China's grip. Brazil holds the world's third-largest rare earth reserves. The country's first rare earths mine, Serre Verde, started commercial production this year.   Output is set to grow, analysts, mining CEOs and investors say, supported by Western government incentives that are also accelerating a global rare earths refining and processing industry. \"Brazil as a source of potential rare earths is a very exciting proposition because there have been some very meaningful discoveries made in the past couple of years,\" said Daniel Morgan of Barrenjoey investment bank in Sydney. \"I do think outside of China, Brazil's projects are the most economic greenfield projects available.\" The US and its allies, almost entirely dependent on China for rare earths metals and magnets, set out to build a separate supply chain by 2027 after deliveries were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic early this decade.  LONG HAUL China produced 240,000 metric tons of rare earths last year, more than five times the next biggest producer, the United States, according to US Geological Survey data. It processes around 90 per cent of the global supply of rare earths into permanent magnets used in everything from wind turbines to electric vehicles and missiles. For countries like Australia, Vietnam and Brazil looking to catch up, progress is slow. Serra Verde has taken 15 years to get into production. It is expected to produce 5,000 tons this year and could double output by 2030, its CEO said. \"Serra Verde and Brazil have significant competitive advantages that could underpin the development of a globally significant rare earths industry over the long term,\" Serra Verde CEO Thras Moraitis told Reuters. Those include attractive geology, access to hydropower, established regulations and a skilled workforce, he said. \"It is still a nascent sector which will require continued support to establish itself in a highly competitive market. Key processing technologies are controlled by a small number of players,\" he said. Brazil could have two or three more rare earths mines by 2030, potentially exceeding Australia's current annual output, said Reg Spencer, an analyst at broker Canaccord.   BASEMENT PRICES One major obstacle is a 70 per cent slump in rare earths prices over the past two years that has made it difficult for companies to raise funds for mines and processing. \"Getting money at the moment is tough,\" Nick Holthouse, chief executive of Australian-listed developer Meteoric Resources, told Reuters. Meteoric is targeting an investment decision in late 2025 for its Caldeira project in Brazil's Minas Gerais state which will produce light and heavy rare earths. In March, the US Export-Import Bank (EXIM) expressed interest in providing Meteoric up to $250 million for the project. The company also has a preliminary deal to supply rare earth oxides to a separation plant in Estonia run by Toronto-listed Neo Performance Materials. Brazilian Rare Earths, too, is in the early stages of developing a large rare earths deposit in the country's northeast, backed by Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart. Its CEO, Bernardo Da Veiga, highlighted Brazil's low operating costs as an advantage over rivals like Australia, where he said a truck driver at an iron ore mine would earn up to A$200,000 ($133,200) a year plus food and accommodation. \"That same truck driver in Brazil, doing the same job, earns like $15,000 a year and he rides his bike to work and brings his lunch. There's just no comparison.\"  COMPLEXITIES While labour is cheap, developers face technical hurdles. Unlike in China, many Western companies are still perfecting the complex processes for producing rare earth metals, a costly challenge that has stalled projects for years. To spur developments, the Brazilian government launched a 1 billion reais ($194.53 million) fund in February to finance strategic minerals projects, including rare earths. It also wants to build an industry for transforming these minerals into alloys for batteries, wind turbines and electric motors, the Ministry of Mines and Energy said in a statement. The challenge is to stimulate production and build partnerships to promote element separation technologies and supply chain development, the ministry said. It is also looking into rare earths recycling. Among companies talking to the government about recycling technology is Australia's Ionic Rare Earths, which has a pilot recycling plant in Belfast and a tie up with Brazilian developer Viridis Mining and Minerals, its CEO Tim Harrison said. Brazil is also building a magnet factory due to start operating later this year as a proof of concept, Flavio Roscoe, president of Minas Gerais' state Federation of Industries (FIEMG) said. \"Our objective is to be a developer, a multiplyer of this technology,\" Roscoe said. \"Brazil has the opportunity to be the world's option to China.\"",

It added that this growth rate is expected to continue up to 2030, if the present increase in policy momentum continues.&ldquo;In the next 10 years, we forecast that 410 GW of new offshore wind capacity will be installed, bringing offshore wind deployment in line with global targets to install 380 GW by 2030,&rdquo; GWEC noted. It said that the majority of capacity will come at the turn of the decade, with two-thirds installed between 2029 and 2033. &ldquo;This anticipated growth will be driven by the arrival of the next wave of offshore wind markets like Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brazil, Colombia , Ireland, India and Poland,&rdquo; said the report titled &lsquo;Global Growth Framework for Offshore Wind&rsquo;. According to Ben Backwell, CEO, GWEC, installing almost 11 GW of offshore wind is the leading edge of a new wave of offshore wind growth. &ldquo;Policy progress - especially across the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas - has set us on course to regularly install record-breaking capacity annually, and pass the 380 GW target set up by the Global Offshore Wind Alliance. That means offshore wind is on course to achieve the tripling ambition set at COP28 in Dubai,&rdquo; said Backwell.India has over 70 GW of offshore wind potential which the central government wants to tap and has already published a tentative tender trajectory for sea-bed lease in this decade. In February this year, the Solar Energy Corporation of India notified a request for selection for the allocation of sea-bed lease rights for 4,000 MW offshore wind power projects. There is a likelihood of notification of viability gap funding linked tender this year, said the report.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON/BRUSSELS: British wind and solar farms exporting power to continental Europe could face CO2 fees from 2026 - even though they don't produce any emissions - unless the UK and European Union can agree changes around the EU's carbon border tax. The charges, set out in a little-noticed clause of the CO2 levy law, could hit revenues of renewable energy projects in the UK, add to already-high EU power prices and even lead to higher emissions, industry sources and analysts told Reuters. \"It's a problem on both sides,\" said Adam Berman, deputy director of industry group Energy UK. \"(It) disincentivises clean power in the UK at the moment in which we're trying to ramp up provision of clean power, and it's going to increase (power) prices in northern Europe.\" The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will impose a CO2 emissions fee on imports to the EU of steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity and hydrogen, unless the exporting nation has equal CO2 pricing policies. Under its current design, the CO2 fee for power would be calculated using a default value based on average and historic power generation emissions. The British energy industry says that will unfairly penalise renewables. \"It is an issue that we are conscious of and one that we have raised, that the UK has raised, with the EU,\" Catherine Stewart, the UK Treasury's deputy director for trade policy, told an event in Brussels last month. A European Commission spokesperson said it would continue talks with all countries, including the UK, on the design of the carbon levy before finalising its application from 2026. The extra cost of the charge could make it uneconomic to export excess clean power from Britain to Europe at certain times when demand is weaker, renewables generation is high, and power prices are low, analysts said. Analysis from Aurora Energy Research, shared with Reuters, showed as much as 3 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable power generation, enough to power up to 2,000 homes a year, could be curtailed by 2030 if the fee proves a disincentive to exporters. \"You are adding a tax on exporting, so this essentially reduces the profit margin every time you want to export,\" said Pranav Menon, GB Power &amp; Renewables Lead at Aurora. In 2030, the carbon border fee could knock 5% off the price British renewable projects can earn for their power, Aurora said. Reduced access to cheap British electricity could increase wholesale power prices by up to 4% in markets like Ireland and Northern Ireland's Integrated Electricity Market which import a lot of power from the UK, the Aurora analysis showed. If European countries boost coal and gas power generation to make up the shortfall, CO2 emissions could even rise - by as much as 13 million tonnes a year, equivalent to emissions of 8 million cars, an earlier analysis by AFRY suggested. A European Commission spokesperson said renewable power exports will be able to avoid the CO2 fee if they can comply with certain criteria and prove their origin. But industry figures say that could be tough. \"Most of the electricity (across interconnectors) is traded anonymously ... so it's almost impossible to demonstrate what that carbon content is,\" said Pieter-Jan Marsboom, products and services manager at UK-Belgian power interconnector Nemo Link.  UK ELECTION British and EU diplomats have quietly begun discussing the issue, but the highly political nature of any post-Brexit deals between the two means no progress is expected before the UK general election on July 4. Some industry groups are already in talks with the Labour Party, which polls suggest is on course to comfortably win the election, in the hope that it would push in government for a deal with Brussels on the CO2 levy. The Labour Party did not respond to requests for comment. One option would be to link the EU and UK carbon markets, exempting UK power producers from the tax. \"The best way to deal with the (CBAM), and to stop the UK exporters paying a tax to the EU that could otherwise go into the UK budget, would be by having (carbon market) linking,\" said UK power generator SSE'S Group Head of Policy and Advocacy Alistair McGirr. So far, neither Brussels nor London has jumped at that idea. Former UK climate change minister Graham Stuart told Reuters in March that the two sides could examine the possibility of linking under their post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The European Commission spokesperson said the bloc is open to linking its carbon market with others, but this \"must stem from a mutual wish from both parties\". \"This remains to be explored,\" the spokesperson said.",

Installed at a cost of Rs 12.5 crore, the grid-connected rooftop solar power plant will save Rs 30 lakh in electricity bills every month, he said while addressing the official programme here. \"Today, we took a giant leap forward in our goal to become a Net-Zero Govt, as I inaugurated a 2.5 MW Solar Project in Janata Bhawan, making #AssamGreenSecretariat, India's first Green Secretariat,\" Sarma said in a post on X after the function. From now onwards, the secretariat complex will run entirely on solar power, resulting in savings of Rs 30 lakh every month on electricity bills, he added. The Chief Minister also said the government has decided that all official complexes will be fitted with solar panels, beginning with the medical colleges and universities across the state. The power installations at all government offices will have automatic disconnection facilities at 8-9 pm, except home, finance and CM secretariat, he added. \"So far, the electricity bills of all ministers, senior officials and other staff staying at official quarters were being paid by the government. This 75-year-old practice will stop in July. We will pay our bills on our own,\" Sarma said. After implementing all these steps, which will result in saving of cost and power both, the state-run Assam Power Distribution Company Ltd (APDCL) will explore the possibility of reducing power tariff by Re 1 from April 1, 2025 to provide relief to consumers, he added.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: PwC India anticipates an upswing in the India markets, especially in small to mid-size M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) transactions and growth fundings driven by increasing investors' confidence. The year 2023 witnessed the emergence of a nuanced M&amp;A landscape, with investors showing interests in diverse strategies and larger-scale ventures, even amid an overall decrease in PE investment, said Sanjeev Krishan, Chairperson, PwC in India.  While PE deals were higher in volume, strategic deals dominated the top deals -- and domestic deals with group-level consolidations were a prominent theme. The first quarter of 2024 marked a resurgence in deal value and volume.  According to a PwC report, top 10 deals of 2023 included JV buyouts, strategic investments, PE buyouts, and stock mergers, and contributed to 21 per cent of the total deal value. While PE deals were higher in volume overall, strategic deals dominated the top deals with domestic deals and group-level consolidations as a significant theme.  \"On a sectoral basis, traditional sectors including retail and consumer and healthcare and pharmaceuticals are in the lead. We anticipate an upswing in the India markets, especially in small to mid-size M&amp;A transactions and growth fundings,\" Krishan told PTI.  He was responding to a query on the changing landscape of M&amp;A in India.  The optimism around M&amp;A, he said, is based on three key factors -- the improving financial markets indicate an increase in investor and CEO confidence; deal-making has reached an inflection point with pent-up buyer demand and a build-up in seller assets; and accelerating global megatrends have created a need for firms to reinvent their business models, which can be accelerated through M&amp;A.  According to Krishan, sectors like e-commerce, healthcare and biotechnology, renewable energy, EVs and EV infrastructure, infrastructure, banking, financial services and insurance, IT services, and technology (including AI &amp; semiconductors) show exciting prospects.  \"Going forward, we could expect a shift towards growth funding and a possible venture capital revival. We could also see an increase in controlling stake deals, and a rise in portfolio exits through capital markets and IPOs,\" he said.  In keeping with the transformation trend, the same might be visible with PE operating models as well -- increased buyouts, platforms and bolt-ons, as well an increased focus on sustainability and ESG integration, he added.  On PwC's expansion plans in India, Krishan said each of the service lines -- advisory, assurance and tax -- has grown and recorded a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in the range of 20-25 per cent.  \"We are also making changes in how we operate to ensure that we are better aligned to India's 'Viksit Bharat' agenda and contribute to it in a meaningful manner,\" he said.  In terms of headcount, he said the current size stands at 27,000 people across India, including around 700 partners.  Krishan further said PwC India has been focusing on bringing in talent across key areas including transformation, emerging technologies, GCC, ESG, risk, and deals.",

Wickremesinghe, who was travelling in the northeastern district of Mannar to inspect the development work in the region, said that the preliminary work of the feasibility study was over and the final phase would be completed soon. This proposal and the prospect of a power grid connection between the two nations are likely to be discussed during the visit of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to Lanka this week. Wickremesinghe said a commercial venture to sell the excess renewable energy to India would also be discussed during the minister's visit. On Saturday, the Lankan foreign ministry here announced that Jaishankar would arrive in Colombo on June 20. However, there was no official announcement on Jaishankar's visit from India's Ministry of External Affairs. If confirmed, this could be Jaishankar's first official stand-alone visit abroad after he was appointed India's External Affairs Minister in the new government early this month. Officials here confirmed that all Indian projects in Sri Lanka, including the Adani group's wind power project in Mannar and the creation of an industrial zone in the eastern port district of Trincomalee, would be discussed during the visit. Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda has been quoted as saying in the local media that Sri Lanka would raise the contentious issue of illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters by Indian fishing, including bottom trawling. The Palk Strait, a narrow strip of water separating Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from both countries. Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each other's waters.",

Similarly, 2,000 hectares will be allotted for the second solar park of 1,000 MW, of which 1,194 hectares are in Surasar, and about 807 hectares are in Bhanavatawala village, it said.  Approval has been given for allotment of 900 hectares in Sardarpura village to set up the third solar park of 450 MW in Bikaner. These solar parks will be developed by Rajasthan Akshay Urja Nigam in three phases under the Solar Park Scheme of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy of the central government, it said.  Sharma has also approved the allotment of 910 hectares in Bhadla village of Phalodi district to NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd for setting up a 500 MW solar project.  The chief minister said through these projects will help fulfil the state's resolve to be self-reliant in the field of energy.  He said these projects will not only create employment opportunities at the local level, but also give new impetus to economic activities in the region.  Sharma said these solar projects will also play an important role in environmental protection and will reduce carbon emissions by about 2 lakh tonnes annually.  Through these projects, an investment of about Rs 10,000 crore will be made in the state, the CM said.  Being an MNRE approved project, 33 per cent grants will be received and it can be completed in the next two years.  According to the statement, the state government signed MoUs worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore on March 10 between Rajasthan State Electricity Generation Corporation Ltd, NTPC Ltd, NTPC Green Energy Ltd, Coal India Ltd and NLC India Ltd to set up 3,325 MW thermal projects and 28,500 MW renewable energy projects under joint venture.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Essar Group plans to invest Rs 30,000 crore over the next four years in setting up a green hydrogen plant at Jamnagar in Gujarat as the metals-to-infrastructure conglomerate eyes clean energy as a key pillar for its new phase of growth. The conglomerate is looking to decarbonise its oil refinery in the UK, construct a green steel plant in Saudi Arabia, and build an LNG and electric ecosystem to decarbonise long-haul heavy trucks, Prashant Ruia, director of Essar Capital, which manages the group's portfolio of investments, said.  It is also considering an entry into mining of critical minerals, mainly used in electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind-turbine magnets.  Essar Future Energy plans to develop 1 gigawatt of hydrogen capacity along with associated green molecules capacity of 1 million tonne per annum in Jamnagar over the next four years, he said in an interview with PTI.  \"We are going to invest around Rs 30,000 crore (in the green hydrogen project in Jamnagar),\" he said.  Essar will use 4.5 GW of renewable energy by a sister concern Essar Renewables to split water molecules to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen, the cleanest known source of energy in the world, so produced can be used to power vehicles, generate electricity, power industry and heat homes and businesses.  Hydrogen, which on burning produces only water, however cannot be shipped and is instead used to make green ammonia which can be easily transported.  \"The idea is to create green molecules that can be transported directly rather than green ammonia. Because you carry green ammonia and then you convert it into hydrogen. That cost is very high. So we are trying to build a complex which can make green molecules from hydrogen and largely in the biofuels space and export that,\" Ruia said.  The conglomerate, which turned debt-free in 2022 after selling some infrastructure assets, will expand its capacity to generate electricity from coal alongside building a renewable energy platform.  \"The idea is to grow to about 10,000 MW over the next 3-5 years,\" he said.  This includes Essar Power expanding its 1,200 MW Salaya-DevBhoomi Dwarka thermal power plant by an additional 1,600 MW to meet Gujarat's base-load needs.  In the realm of green mobility solutions, Essar is focused on building an LNG and electric ecosystem to decarbonise long-haul heavy trucks, contributing to a cleaner transportation sector, he said.  It has a fleet of 450 to 500 LNG-powered trucks that are used by different industries for their logistics needs, he said.  Trucks are the biggest polluters on the road, producing some 110 tonne of carbon dioxide per truck. There are 4 million trucks in the country and the number are slated to double in the near future.  Replacing diesel in trucks with LNG, helps cut CO2 emissions by 30-35 per cent. Also, gas does not produce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx) which cause acid rain and air pollution.  Alongside, the group also has a fleet of electric trucks.  Emissions from electric vehicles are zero.  \"So what we're trying, if you take the combination of the two you can reduce about 60-70 per cent of the CO2,\" he said.  Essar is also building a retail network to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to trucks, he said adding LNG-powered trucks can run for 1,300-1,400 kilometers on a full tank while electric trucks have a range of around 150-km.  \"So short-range is electric and longer range can be LNG,\" he said.  Besides, the group is producing gas from coal seams from a block in West Bengal, he said.  Its arm, Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Limited (EOGEPL), India's leader in the coal bed methane industry, contributes nearly 65 per cent of the country's total coal bed methane production and aims to increase its contribution to India's total gas production to 5 per cent within the next five years.  Gas produced from coal-seams, called coal-bed methane, can be used as CNG for running automobiles as well as generating electricity and making fertilizer.  \"We are today India's largest CBM player. We do about a million cubic meters of gas per day which is very small,\" he said. \"Our idea is to grow that so we are investing Rs 2,000-3,000 crore to increase the gas-based portfolio.\"  The firm is also exploring for shale gas in the Raniganj CBM block in West Bengal.  \"India has not yet had a commercial success shale. We all know the revolution in the US because of shale. So we feel that there are some opportunities there. We are going to explore that... so please do not get excited yet but we are trying,\" he said.  Essar plans to invest USD 3.6 billion to decarbonize its Stanlow refinery in the UK and another USD 4 billion to set up a green steel plant, which will use hydrogen, in Saudi Arabia.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Energy efficiency could slash India's greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 per cent, according to insights shared at the ETEnergyworld India Net Zero Forum. The discussion, part of a panel on \"Tech and Innovation - Leading the way for India&rsquo;s Energy Journey,\" saw industry leaders underline the critical role of advanced technologies in achieving these significant reductions.Ashok Kumar, Deputy Director General at the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Ministry of Power, underscored the potential of energy-saving measures. He said, \"Energy efficiency is projected to contribute significantly to climate change mitigation, with estimates from entities like the IEA showing that it could account for 40 to 50 per cent of emission reduction efforts.\"C. Laxma Reddy, Executive Director of ONGC Ltd, added a historical perspective on the environmental impact of traditional energy sources. \"We owe a degree of gratitude to the oil and gas industry for its role in delaying the onset of climate change. Had it not been for oil and gas, we might have relied more heavily on even more polluting sources like wood and coal,\" Reddy noted.The panel also discussed the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the energy sector. Rajiv Agarwal, Director (Technical) at Engineers India Ltd, highlighted their role in enhancing operational efficiencies. \"AI and ML are transforming predictive maintenance in the oil and gas industry, which traditionally spends significant amounts on maintaining complex equipment. Now, AI tools help monitor critical indicators like machine vibrations and operating temperatures, significantly enhancing maintenance efficiency,\" Agarwal explained.Raman Kalra, Senior Partner &amp; VP at IBM Consulting, pointed out the advantages of AI and ML in grid management. \"AI and ML are proving highly beneficial at the low-voltage grid and substation transformer level, improving focus, preventing outages, and reducing breakdowns and maintenance needs,\" said Kalra.Shubhashis Dey, Director of Climate Policy &amp; Climate Finance at Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, emphasized the need for focused investment in energy storage solutions. \"For RTC power, energy storage system is one of the most important aspects which government and industry should look into. Observing how China has advanced, similar incentivization and structuring of infrastructure funds are necessary to support the ecosystem changes required for implementing solar and other battery storage solutions,\" Dey remarked.Sudhir Pathak, Head of Central Design &amp; Engg at Hero Future Energies, touched on the reliability challenges associated with renewable energy. \"Renewable energy is great when it works, but it can be tricky when things go wrong,\" said Pathak.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a significant convergence of industrial heavyweights, the ETEnergyworld India Net Zero Forum witnessed a robust dialogue among leaders who committed to intensifying their efforts towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards and achieving ambitious net zero targets. The panel discussion, themed \"The Intersection of ESG and Net Zero in India,\" served as a platform for these corporate stalwarts to outline their strategies and address the multifaceted challenges in their sustainability endeavors.Capt. Prashant Widge, Head of ESG and Public Affairs at AP Moller &ndash; Maersk, South Asia, elaborated on how Maersk is embedding ESG into the core of its operations. He stated, \"For us, ESG is a holistic approach and going forward an enabler of doing business. Maersk is a values and purpose-driven corporation. Net impact of society is of paramount importance for Maersk. We undertake asset recycling of ships, containers.\"Echoing the sentiment, Dev Tripathy, Director of Finance at Philips India, shared insights into the environmental impact of their industry, likening it to the shipping or aviation sectors. \"We are one of the industries which contribute 4.4 per cent of the carbon dioxide industry and can be compared to the shipping or aviation industry. In India, 17-20 per cent of the population is addressed by us. We have a huge responsibility. Our latest MRI machines have been innovated and are eco-designed and with reduced helium inputs without compromising the quality,\" Tripathy remarked.Ramnath Vaidyanathan, AVP and Head of Environmental Sustainability at Godrej Industries Ltd, highlighted the pragmatic challenges of net zero commitments within the supply chain. \"We have a net zero target of 2035. Industry is not at that level wherein you can ask your suppliers to adhere to net zero obligations,\" he noted.From a construction and urban development perspective, Aun Abdullah, Head of ESG at Lodha, emphasized the critical role of ESG in the growth trajectory of the country. \"For us, ESG is not a compliance issue, it's important for the growth of the country in a tangible way. If urbanization were to happen, then energy security, social mobility, and climate security is essential. 50 per cent of emissions come from buildings and decarbonization is important. The biggest problem in the country is data scarcity and supply chain inefficiencies,\" Abdullah explained.UPL's Head of Sustainability, Harshal Sonawane, unveiled the company's goal for substantial carbon sequestration. \"We want to sequester 1 giga tonne of carbon back to the soil globally by 2040. Agri-food ecosystem contributes almost 34 per cent to the overall greenhouse emissions. Fertilizer, water, and trash management is important for net zero ambitions,\" he said.Sourav Gupta, Chief Risk Officer at Pipeline Infrastructure Ltd, cautioned about the need for grounded and viable ESG strategies. \"While we are pushing ourselves for target dates, our ESG pursuits need to be realistic, commercially viable, and we ensure that we do not resort to greenwashing being overtly zealous,\" Gupta added.The discussions also touched upon leveraging advanced technologies such as AI to enhance ESG practices, furthering the industry&rsquo;s capacity to meet sustainability targets effectively.",

Laying the foundation stone of a 25 mw solar power plant at Namrup in Dibrugarh, he said this would be the state's contribution towards the environment. \"We are already in the process of producing 200 mw of solar power. Within this year, the work for the rest will begin,\" Sarma said. The Namrup plant will be built at a cost of Rs 115 crore and once commissioned, it will add to the state's multi-pronged strategy to move towards a green energy regime, he said. The project, a joint venture between Assam Power Generation Corporation and Oil India Limited, is expected to be complete by July 2025. Sarma said when he was sworn in as chief minister in 2021, the peak-hour demand in the state stood at 1,800 mw, and has now increased to 2,500 mw because of the rise in the number of industries and electrification of villages. The state produces a mere 419 mw of power, and it has to purchase around 2,100 mw on a daily basis, he said. \"Initiatives such as the solar power project at Namrup will augment the state's power generation capacity, and will contribute greatly towards reducing reliance on power purchased from outside the state,\" he added. Seven solar power plants are functional in the state at present, producing 175 mw daily, Sarma said. The power plants in Sonitpur district's Barchalla and Dhubri district's Khudigaon are at various stages of development, while the construction of the 1,000 mw solar power plant at Karbi Anglong would begin soon, he said.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Asserting the need to decentralise the water and energy production system, Housing and Urban Affairs Additional Secretary D Thara on Friday asked real estate developers to change the way they build housing projects and make them self-sustainable. Speaking at the 3rd convention of realtors body Naredco's women wing 'NAREDCO Mahi' on Friday, she asked real estate developers to make provisions of rainwater harvesting compulsory in their projects and also add playing area for children.  \"It's very important to change the way we are building houses. Let us not get water from outside. Can you get water for your own buildings, for your own use and energy from your own buildings, for your own use,\" Thara said when asked about her wish list from the developers' fraternity.  \"The world has to change from centralised energy and water production to decentralised citizen-based water and energy production. Rainwater harvesting cannot be an addendum to our buildings. It has to be part of integral hardcore infrastructure,\" she observed.  Thara also told builders to explore the provisioning of cool pathways powered by solar energy in housing societies.  Naredco President G Haribabu regretted that the real estate sector still does not have as many women entrepreneurs as required for its potential because their participation is still about 8-10 per cent, whereas in other professions such as medical and nursing, women's participation reaches almost 40 per cent of the total capacity.  He said the time has come for each real estate player to consider increasing the enrolment of women in the real estate sector.  Naredco Chairman Niranjan Hiranandani highlighted that in the first cabinet meeting of the new NDA government, construction of 3 crore housing units was cleared for the next five years, of which 2 crore would be built in rural areas, while the remaining 1 crore would be constructed in urban areas.  \"This would give a new direction to the real estate sector for its all-around transformation,\" he said.  Hiranandani also demanded that the government should launch a Rs 25,000 crore programme for the rehabilitation of slum dwellers in and around Mumbai.  NAREDCO Vice Chairman Rajan Bandelkar also appreciated the emphasis of the new government to construct an additional 3 crore housing units in the affordable housing sector, saying it would be another landmark to register higher growth in the Indian real estate sector.  NAREDCO Mahi President Ananta Singh Raghuvanshi said the association has been doing its best to promote women empowerment in real estate.",

            "articleBody": "WASHINGTON: A policy group led by the United Steelworkers union and domestic manufacturers is calling for the U.S. to enact stronger trade barriers to Chinese imports after President Joe Biden imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, solar panels and other strategic goods. The Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) on Friday published a report on China's excess industrial capacity that echoes concerns raised by the Biden administration and U.S. allies in recent months, saying quick action was needed to stem a rising tide of cheap and subsidized exports that threatens U.S. jobs. The group called for the return of a long-expired import surge protection tool that was created when Beijing joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the event that turned China into a global export powerhouse. The so-called Section 421 safeguard was designed to allow the U.S. to impose temporary tariffs to ease market disruptions caused by surges of imports from China's low-cost manufacturing base that was welcomed into the global trading system 23 years ago. The idea was to give domestic industries some breathing room as China transitioned to a market economy with a more level playing field - a transition that never came. Section 421 was invoked only once, in 2009 by then-President Barack Obama, at the request of the United Steelworkers, whose members were being laid off by U.S. tire plants hit by a flood of Chinese imports. The action temporarily raised the tariff rate on Chinese tires to up to 35% from the 4% WTO rate, but Section 421 expired in 2013. With new import surges threatened in new industries including EVs, solar and semiconductors, as well as continuing surges in older sectors such as steel, glass and tires, Section 421 should be revived and modernized, AAM said. \"Beijing has failed to abide by its WTO commitments and remains a non-market economy,\" AAM said in the report. \"It's state-driven support for critical sectors is causing massive overcapacity and threatens import surges in the United States, necessitating the reinstatement of the Section 421 tool,\" AAM said in the report. It called for changes to allow such duties on Chinese import surges from plants in third countries, such as Mexico or Vietnam and a faster process to impose the tariffs before permanent damage to U.S. output is done. It also said the relief options should be broader and longer in duration. The report laid out job losses and plant closures in the U.S. paper, glass, steel and tire industries caused by Chinese imports, and said that the U.S. needs a more proactive approach to avoid a repeat in newer sectors. Excess capacity is a \"feature, not a bug\" of China's state-driven economic model, it said.  G7 CONFRONTS CHINA The recommendations were published as leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies met in southern Italy, where Biden is pressing his administration's case for the G7 to present a \"wall of opposition\" to China's industrial policies and subsidies. It also follows this week's decision by European Union officials to impose punitive tariffs of 17.4% to 38.1% on Chinese EVs to combat a finding of excessive government subsidies for the sector. AAM President Scott Paul said he was encouraged by the U.S. and EU tariff actions, calling Biden's move a watershed moment to get out in front of China's overcapacity at a time when Washington is investing heavily in a new energy transition. The European tariffs show that Biden \"is not alone in his concerns about China's EV overcapacity and subsidies. This is validation that there are widespread concerns about Beijing's policies and practices.\" Among other protections, the group recommended several steps aimed at countering China's circumvention of U.S. tariffs by shifting production to third countries such as Mexico and Vietnam, including passing proposed legislation to strengthen U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws to cover production from third-country investments, and strengthening rules of origin requirements in U.S. free trade agreements to exclude Chinese content.",

SECI is a reliable and better customer than discoms,\" Pratap noted.The discussions reflected a consensus on the urgency of enhancing policy frameworks and financial mechanisms to accelerate India's journey towards achieving its net zero ambitions effectively.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: Oklahoma may be better known as a top-five producer of oil and natural gas within the United States, but its energy sector is fast becoming a shining star in the renewables field as well. Between 2018 and 2023, Oklahoma boosted clean electricity generation by 35 per cent, more than twice the national average and exceeding the growth pace of clean energy giant California over that period, data from energy think tank Ember shows. Oklahoma's power producers also cut total fossil fuel-powered generation by nearly 12 per cent since 2018, which again was double the rate seen nationally and sharply exceeded fossil fuel use cuts in Texas and California during the same time frame. Higher clean power output along with cuts to fossil fuel use have helped Oklahoma's power sector cut emissions by 20 per cent since 2018, vastly exceeding the 7 per cent emissions cut posted by Texas over the same period and the 14 per cent drop in national emissions. And thanks to continued growth in wind generation capacity so far in 2024, Oklahoma looks set to emerge as a key driving force behind national energy transition efforts alongside its better known clean power producers. WIND POWER Aggressive expansions to wind generation capacity have been the main driver of Oklahoma's clean energy growth, with wind's share of the state's electricity mix jumping from around 32 per cent in 2018 to 42 per cent in 2023. Oklahoma's electricity generation from wind farms jumped by 38 per cent over that five-year span, and in 2022 the state produced more electricity from wind than from any other source. Natural gas has re-emerged as Oklahoma's primary power source from 2023, but sustained growth in wind capacity looks set to ensure clean power's share of the electricity mix continues to expand. From 2020 through 2023, Oklahoma's wind capacity grew by an annual average of 1,049 megawatts (MW), which sharply exceeded the growth rates of all other states except Texas during that window, according to energy data portal Cleanview. During the first quarter of 2024 Oklahoma added a further 403 MW of wind capacity, which was second only to Texas' 449 MW and indicates that Oklahoma could set a new state record for wind capacity additions in 2024. CARBON INTENSITY CUTS Oklahoma's clean power drive has been a relatively recent development. While Texas' power system has generated more than 10 per cent of its electricity from clean sources since 2000, Oklahoma's clean power share only crossed the 10 per cent threshold in 2012, Ember data shows. But since then, clean power output has accelerated rapidly, and has accounted for more than 40 per cent of Oklahoma's annual electricity supply since 2021. This retooling of Oklahoma's power system from primarily fossil fuel based to heavily powered by clean sources has in turn led to a rapid reduction in the state's power sector carbon intensity. Since 2018, the carbon intensity of Oklahoma's electricity generation has fallen from around 384 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilowatt hour (KWh) to 297 grams of CO2 per KWh by 2023. That 23 per cent fall in carbon intensity is again far greater than the 14 per cent fall in national power intensity over the same period, and also exceeds the 10 per cent fall in California and 18 per cent drop in Texas over the same period. Oklahoma's carbon intensity has also dropped from registering consistently above the national average through 2016 to being consistently below the national average since then, which has further reinforced the state's reputation as an emerging clean energy leader.  WIDENING TRANSITION Oklahoma's energy consumers have also made significant shifts to usage patterns and sources. Oklahoma's car drivers posted the largest yearly jump in electricity use for electric vehicle (EV) charging of all US states in 2023, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The 74 per cent jump in Oklahoma's electricity demand for EV charging far exceeded the growth rate in surrounding states and the national average (45 per cent) last year, and highlights how households can also help drive power sector decarbonization. But the state's power producers remain the most critical source of clean energy progress. If they can continue to roll out new clean generation capacity while curbing fossil fuel use, the state could soon eclipse its larger rivals and emerge as a new darling of national energy transition efforts.By Gavin Maguire",

            "articleBody": "The late economist Milton Friedman, the patron saint of conservative capitalism, didn&rsquo;t have much use for government involvement in business. But he made an exception for pollution. If an industry spoils the environment, he often said, then the government should tax it until it cleans up its act. Because if polluters can pollute for free, then they are essentially stealing wealth and well-being from everybody else.When he said that in the 1960s and &rsquo;70s, he was talking about smog and the like. But as scientists and oil companies knew then, and we all know now, carbon dioxide is another form of pollution, one that is heating the world and threatening human civilisation. Making polluters pay a price for this negative externality, as Friedman would call it, is an idea that is not only conservative and capitalist and moral but also a boon to both the environment and federal budgets. So, naturally, the world&rsquo;s shining bastion of conservative capitalism, the United States, consistently rejects Friedman&rsquo;s idea. Fortunately, plenty of other countries are getting on board with it. And they may soon enough drag the US into joining them. Fifty countries now have national systems for pricing carbon, involving a carbon tax, emissions trading or a combination of both, according to the latest World Bank tally. These systems cover 24% of the world&rsquo;s carbon emissions, up from just 7% in 2013.  Dozens of local governments have their own mechanisms, including California, Massachusetts and Washington. Nineteen countries and 13 more local governments are actively debating or preparing to take up the practice, including six more US states. The US government is one of just three members of the Group of 20 nations that are in no hurry to price carbon. The other two are Russia and Saudi Arabia (and even Saudi Arabia is at least about to launch a voluntary carbon-credit market, for whatever that&rsquo;s worth). This is not what you would call good company, though it is perhaps understandable &mdash; all three are large producers of fossil fuels. Refusing to price carbon amounts to a $700 billion annual gift to US oil companies.But the pressure to change is building, even if the pace is still too slow. Carbon pricing raised a record $104 billion in revenue last year, a far cry from the trillions needed annually to deep-six fossil fuels and avoid the most catastrophic climate change. US involvement would move the needle significantly.Europe, of all places, may be the source of the most pressure. The European Union is transitioning to a carbon tariff, called the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, that will be fully in place in 2026. This will charge foreign exporters for the emissions they generate in the production process, which will move the market&rsquo;s invisible hand to favor cleaner production. And it will be fair because EU producers already pay a price for carbon as part of the union&rsquo;s cap-and-trade system. The tariff and the trading system work together to set a carbon price that everybody pays.Another key detail about the CBAM is that it gives exporters a break if they can prove they&rsquo;ve already paid a carbon fee in their home countries. That will push those countries &mdash; including the US &mdash; to set their own carbon price or get left behind, MIT economist Catherine Wolfram noted in a recent session at Harvard University&rsquo;s Climate Action Week.Not that there aren&rsquo;t plenty of other great reasons for the US to jump on board. At the session with Wolfram was Harvard economist James Stock, who estimated that adding a carbon tax to the Inflation Reduction Act&rsquo;s clean-energy incentives would cut US carbon emissions by 66% by 2035, easily surpassing the Biden administration&rsquo;s stated goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030. Without it, the country is on a path to climate failure.&ldquo;No models indicate the 2030 US climate target would be met with the IRA alone,&rdquo; Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said on the panel. He has proposed legislation for both a domestic carbon price and a border tariff. &ldquo;If we want a pathway to climate safety, it will require we do what&rsquo;s economically and morally right and price carbon pollution.&rdquo; A carbon tax could also raise $2 trillion over a decade, Wolfram said, putting a huge dent in the federal budget deficit when everybody is starting to panic about it again. That estimate is consistent with other studies &mdash; though a new one from researchers at the University of British Columbia suggests a global carbon tax could raise $2 trillion per year, enough to cover a universal basic income for the entire planet. As Whitehouse noted, US manufacturers are already two-thirds less carbon-polluting than those in, say, China. This means Europe&rsquo;s tariff will benefit them even if the US doesn&rsquo;t lift a finger to impose its own price. But doing so would benefit them even more while also tweaking China. That calculus has inspired bipartisan interest, including a bill by Republican Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina proposing their own carbon tariff. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Liam Denning noted, Cassidy has gone out of his way to deny his tariff would amount to carbon pricing. Without a domestic carbon price, a border tariff probably wouldn&rsquo;t be fair enough to withstand World Trade Organisation scrutiny, Wolfram suggested. Still, the bill was another encouraging sign that momentum is growing toward the US finally taking Milton Friedman&rsquo;s advice. It can&rsquo;t happen soon enough.",

            "articleBody": "MUNICH: Bavaria will make use of laws that allow it to buy more than 85 hydropower plants from Uniper in the southern German state, its premier said on Thursday, undermining the nationalised utility's plans to boost renewable energy. Officials from Bavaria and Uniper have said the state government can enforce a transfer against Uniper's will, or that of its owner, Germany's federal government. Bavaria has a long tradition of seeking to manage its own affairs, and there is no love lost between its conservative premier Markus Soeder and the federal government led by centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Bavaria, which said it would begin transferring the assets from 2030, would have to pay compensation and honour contracts. Soeder told the state parliament on Thursday that Bavaria had so far not managed to reach an agreement with Uniper. His government was acting on the principle of \"local energy in local hands\", he added. It was not immediately clear how much compensation Bavaria would have to pay and how many megawatts of capacity would be affected. A Uniper spokesperson said running hydropower plants required considerable capital and skilled personnel. \"Uniper and its predecessor companies have proven over many decades that they can operate the plants safely, efficiently and environmentally friendly (...)\", he added. Uniper has hydropower plants in Germany and Sweden. It operates 99 river plants in Germany, mostly in Bavaria, according to its website. While its main revenue source is still its natural gas business, the Duesseldorf-based utility aims to grow in renewable energy. Uniper was rescued by the German government in 2022 after Russia cut and then suspended gas supplies, forcing the group to buy gas at sky-high prices on the spot market. Berlin is preparing to sell its Uniper shares on the stock market. Sources in February told Reuters it may divest 20%-30% in a first step next year. ",

            "articleBody": "TOKYO: Japan, a major coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyer, could be energy-independent by 2060 thanks to expansion of solar and wind power together with storage batteries, said Jarand Rystad, chief executive of the Rystad Energy consultancy. Japan imports most of its energy resources, with the Middle East, Australia and the United States being its top suppliers. The government's strategy calls for a reduction in LNG and coal to under 40% of the power generation mix by 2030 from more than 60% now. But analysts say Japan is moving slower it needs to. \"Japan's mindset is that we have to import energy because we have no energy ourselves. But with the development in renewable energy technologies, I think that statement doesn't need to be true,\" Rystad told Reuters. According to Rystad, Japan could be energy-sufficient by having 45% of solar power, 30% of wind generation led by offshore farms, 5% of hydropower, another 5% of biomass and e-fuel with nuclear power providing the remaining 15%, by 2060. \"All Japan needs is to continue installing as much solar as it did in the years before 2020. From 2014, you installed between 10 and 12 gigawatts on the peak,\" Rystad said. Japan installed about 4 GW of new solar capacity last year, with its total outstanding solar capacity reaching 87 GW, the world's third biggest behind China and the United States. Rystad said mixing agriculture with solar panels - which also provide the shade preferred by some types of crops - as well as solar rooftops above roads, among other solutions, could help to expand the use of such power. \"The combination of offshore and onshore wind and solar, geothermal and biomass with solid backup from both battery and pumped hydro, should actually enable Japan to see self-dependency in energy in 40 years, or by 2060 even,\" he said.

            "articleBody": "PARIS: The French renewable energy sector is bracing for a sharp slowdown in wind and solar projects if the far-right wins a majority in upcoming elections, just as new legislation was expected to boost the industry in nuclear-dominant France. President Emmanuel Macron's shock decision on Sunday to call a snap election could hand political power to Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party, leaving it in charge of domestic policies including energy. The RN has pledged to end subsidies for renewables and wants to halt expansion of wind power, including pulling down already installed turbines. The party would instead invest in nuclear, hydropower and hydrogen, according to its website. \"It is clear that an RN-dominant parliament would facilitate the implementation of legislation that would at least slow down the development of renewable energy projects,\" said a spokesperson at Velocita Energies, a unit of China's Envision Energy, which operates wind farms in France. Shares in Engie, France's largest wind farm operator, have dropped 6.1 per cent since Monday, wiping 2.1 billion off its market value. France lags its neighbours on renewable energy with about 45 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind and solar power capacity, and has fallen behind targets set by the European Commission. Around 65 per cent of its power supplies came from nuclear in 2023. But the government was due to introduce legislation on Thursday outlining plans for a rapid expansion of solar and wind farms, with a formal consultation expected to start on June 27. The plans included targets to double the annual pace of solar installations to reach 75-100 GW in 2035, with 40-45 GW of onshore wind installations and 18 GW of offshore wind capacity planned over the same period. The legislation, already delayed for almost a year, will now be shelved ahead of elections to kick off on June 30. The RN would likely not dismantle existing wind turbines due to the threat of legal action, but new permitting could stop if the RN holds power, said a manager at a European utility with wind farms in the country, who declined to be named. Government support for solar panels was expected to cost around 590 million euros in 2024. Onshore wind power however would generate nearly 3 billion euros for the state, according to an assessment by the French Energy Regulatory Commission. A slower renewables rollout could also impact France's ability to cover its energy demand over the next 15 years before it builds new nuclear reactors, added Rana Adib, executive director at renewable energy lobby group REN21. \"France must contribute to the European energy system by developing, alongside nuclear power, renewable energy sources which have demonstrated their strengths and competitiveness and will be essential, taking into account the cost and timetable for deploying new nuclear power,\" Engie said in a statement.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: Gains by right wing parties in the recent European Parliament elections may stall the development of a slew of renewable energy projects across Europe. Populist, nationalist and eurosceptic parties are on course to win just under a quarter of seats in the next European Union (EU) assembly, according to the chamber's own projections. And with nationalist prime ministers already leading Hungary, Italy and Slovakia, and right wing parties gaining influence in Germany, France, Spain and The Netherlands, the tenor of Europe's political landscape looks set for an overhaul. Spiralling living costs and concerns over rapid rises in immigration were major drivers of votes for right wing parties across the region, who will now help set European Union policies for the next five years. Pushback against the mounting costs of the green energy transition was also a vote-getter in countries with large farming sectors that have been hit hard by rising energy and fertilizer costs in recent years. A more right-leaning parliament may make it harder to pass ambitious climate policies during the upcoming term, and may even lead to the scrapping of some renewable energy development plans if project timetables get extended or pricing terms get revised unfavourably.  CLEAN PIPELINE Across Europe as a whole, there are roughly 650,000 megawatts (MW) of clean energy capacity in pre-construction, which is when plans are designed and the necessary permits and resources are lined up, Global Energy Monitor (GEM) data shows. That planned total compares to around 714,000 MW of clean energy capacity already in operation across Europe, and means that Europe's total clean generation capacity would roughly double if all the pre-construction projects come to life. Just over 75 per cent of Europe's clean energy projects in pre-construction are within the 27 nations that form the European Union, and so may now come under closer scrutiny by incoming parliament members who may not share the same ambitions as their predecessors.  BREAKDOWN Of the roughly 491,000 MW of clean energy capacity in pre-construction within the EU, 61 per cent is for wind projects and 35 per cent for solar farms. Nuclear reactors account for an additional 3 per cent of the planned clean capacity, while hydro dams account for a further 2 per cent. Around 25,000 MW of oil and gas infrastructure are also in the pre-construction phase, compared to around 195,000 MW of oil and gas projects already in operation, GEM data shows. Regionally, Northern Europe hosts the lion's share of planned projects, with just over 302,000 MW of clean capacity in pre-construction. Southern Europe has the next largest share of planned clean capacity, with around 250,000 MW, followed by Western Europe's 57,300 MW. Eastern Europe has around 40,160 MW of clean capacity in pre-construction. WIND VS SOLAR, NORTH VS SOUTH Wind farms account for 85 per cent of the planned capacity in Northern Europe, where wind power currently accounts for around 43 per cent of operating clean power capacity. The roughly 256,000 MW of wind projects in pre-construction compares to just under 68,000 MW of wind capacity already in operation in Northern Europe, and so would result in a nearly four-fold jump in wind capacity if completed. Sweden has the largest pipeline of wind capacity in pre-construction (95,516 MW), followed by the United Kingdom (89,063 MW), Ireland (37,772 MW), Spain (33,943 MW) and Italy (29,464 MW). Greece, Denmark and The Netherlands also have large wind development plans in the pre-construction phase. In Southern Europe, solar power holds the largest share (60 per cent) of the 250,000 MW of clean capacity pipeline in pre-construction. Of the nearly 150,000 MW of solar in pre-construction in Southern Europe, Spain (86,762 MW) and Greece (52,323 MW) account for the largest pipelines. In Eastern Europe, nuclear plants account for the largest share of the 40,159 MW of clean power capacity in pre-construction (17,000 MW), followed by 13,149 MW of wind projects and around 5,500 MW of solar. Western Europe's largest pipeline in pre-construction is wind power, accounting for around 40,500 MW of the 57,300 MW total planned clean capacity.  POLITICAL FALLOUT The rise in right wing candidates across Europe does not necessarily mean there will be greater opposition to clean energy projects, as many policymakers view greater supplies of home-grown energy as a source of national security and jobs. But many of the incoming bureaucrats who are riding the populist wave of support may hold other priorities, such as promoting economic growth and low-cost manufacturing bases, over power sector decarbonisation. As such, these lawmakers may have the power to slow or blunt legislation that aims to speed up Europe's energy transition, which could result in fewer clean capacity projects reaching completion than are currently planned.

            "articleBody": "WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's grip on a key federal energy commission will last beyond his first term, giving a boost to the Democrat's push for renewable energy regardless of the election results in November. The Senate moved to ensure that political reality as lawmakers approved two new members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and set up a vote on a third new panelist as soon as Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said confirmation of the three nominees would allow FERC to \"keep its quorum and continue its mission of providing Americans with affordable, reliable, safe energy.'' The five-member commission oversees natural gas pipelines and other energy infrastructure, including transmission of electricity across state lines. The panel approved a long-awaited rule last month making it easier to transmit renewable energy such as wind and solar power to the electric grid - a key part of Biden's goal to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 2050. The rule is aimed at boosting the nation's aging power grid to meet surging demand fueled by huge data centers, electrification of vehicles and buildings, artificial intelligence and other uses. Earlier this week, the agency approved a request by the nearly $8 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline to begin sending natural gas across rugged mountainsides in West Virginia and Virginia, despite longstanding objections from environmental groups, landowners and some elected officials.  On Wednesday, the Senate approved the nominations of Democrat David Rosner and Republican Lindsay See for three and four-year terms, respectively, on the commission. Senators also limited debate on Democrat Judy Chang's nomination to a five-year term. A final vote on Chang's nomination to replace Democrat Allison Clements could occur as soon as Thursday. If approved as expected, the vote would give Democrats a working majority on the commission until at least June 2026, when the term of Democratic Chairman Willie Phillips is set to expire. \"A fully seated, bipartisan FERC provides more opportunity for advancing long-lasting, sensible energy infrastructure policy,'' said West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \"When it comes to fairly assessing all interests, five heads are better than one,'' Manchin said Wednesday. \"Bringing together five different people, with five different life experiences and perspectives, helps ensure that all affected interests will be heard and fairly considered and assessed'' by the energy commission. Rosner, See and Chang \"are very different people, from very different backgrounds,'' said Manchin, who supported all three nominees. \"What matters most is their willingness to work with one another, to consider and assess fairly different interests and points of view, and to put partisan passions aside in favor of the public interest.'' Rosner, a former FERC staffer, has spent the past two years on Manchin's Democratic staff on the energy committee. See, who serves as solicitor general for the state of West Virginia, argued the state's case challenging a major U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule on power plant pollution before the Supreme Court. Chang, of Massachusetts, is a former undersecretary of energy and climate solutions for the state government. Manchin said he knows Rosner well: \"I have seen firsthand his expert knowledge on energy issues, his fairness, his nonpartisan approach to every problem we've had, and his ability to work with both sides on these issues, and he's done that tremendously.'' Manchin, a political moderate who plays a crucial role on energy issues, called See \"a very capable and experienced lawyer\" who is \"well-qualified to serve on the commission.'' Chang, who now teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School, led energy policy under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. \"I can think of no better preparation for serving on a bipartisan commission than working for a Republican administration in a very blue state,'' Manchin said. Rosner's nomination was approved, 67-27, while See won approval, 83-12. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia opposed both nominations, saying he continued to be unhappy about federal approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a longtime Manchin priority. \"I voted no on rubber-stamping the same old people to FERC,\" Kaine said in a statement.",

            "articleBody": "BONN: With just five months to go before this year's U.N. climate summit, countries cannot agree on the size of a global funding bill to help the developing world fight climate change - let alone how to split it. The decision is set to dominate the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan in November, where nearly 200 countries need to agree on a new annual financing target for helping poorer countries cut their emissions and protect their societies in a harsher, hotter world. The new target will replace the yearly $100 billion that rich countries had pledged in climate finance from 2020. That goal was met two years late. But preliminary talks this week in Bonn, Germany, have yielded no major breakthroughs. Instead, the talks ending on Thursday have again exposed the unyielding rifts among the world's biggest economies over who should be paying most to fight climate change - and how much. Representatives from climate-vulnerable nations said it was hard watching wealthy nations fall late with past payments of climate finance while quickly approving new funds for military responses to war or spending billions subsidising CO2-emitting energy sources.  \"It seems like money is always there when it's a more 'real' national priority for the country,\" Michai Robertson, negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, told Reuters. \"It's really tough to see that,\" he said. GETTING THE NUMBER RIGHT The new financing target is the core tool that global climate talks can deliver to fund projects that reduce planet-warming emissions - such as renewable energy or low-carbon transport. With all countries due to update their national climate targets next year, negotiators fear failure could lead to weaker efforts. \"How are you going to move forward if there's no financing?\" said South African climate negotiator Pemy Gasela. Her country is among many developing nations warning they cannot afford to cut emissions faster without more financial support - in South Africa's case, to swap a heavy reliance on CO2-emitting coal for clean energy. Yet wealthy countries are wary of setting a target too high and risking it going unmet. The missed $100 billion target became politically symbolic in recent U.N. climate talks, stoking mistrust between nations as developing countries argued the world's economic powers were abandoning them. Diplomats in Bonn have circled the issue of how much money to put on the table. While countries agree $100 billion is too low, there is little chance they would agree to summon the $2.4 trillion per year that the U.N. climate chief in February said was needed to keep the world's climate goals within reach. Neither the European Union or the U.S. have suggested a number for the goal, although both acknowledged this week that it must exceed $100 billion. The 27-country EU is currently the biggest provider of climate finance. The elephant in the negotiation rooms, some diplomats told Reuters, was the upcoming U.S. presidential election, in which Donald Trump is seeking to return to office. The previous Trump administration pulled the world's biggest economy out of the Paris climate agreement. Negotiators said they worry a future Trump administration could halt U.S. climate finance payments, leaving it to other wealthy nations to meet the annual pledge.  But some countries in Bonn have made suggestions.  India, and a group of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, have said the overall financing target should exceed $1 trillion per year, to reflect the spiralling needs of poorer countries as climate change worsens. The Arab countries propose that rich nations provide $441 billion in public funding per year in grants, to leverage a total $1.1 trillion per year from broader sources. Small island countries vulnerable to climate change have also pushed for stricter rules on what counts toward the target, suggesting preventing loans with interest rates above 1%, to avoid adding to poor nations' already-high debts.  Most public climate funds provided by developed nations are loans, according to the OECD. DECIDING WHO SHOULD PAY Countries are also at odds over who should contribute.  There are about two dozen, long-industrialized countries currently obliged to contribute to U.N. climate finance. That list was decided during U.N. climate talks in 1992, when China's economy was still smaller than Italy's. The EU wants China - now the world's biggest CO2 emitter and second biggest economy - and high wealth-per-capita Middle Eastern countries to contribute for the new goal. The U.S. has also argued for adding more countries in the donor base.  However, the Arab countries and China firmly opposed this idea, with Beijing reiterating China's status as a \"developing country\" under the U.N. climate convention.  \"We, the developing countries, have no intention to make your number look good or be part of your responsibility, as we are doing all we can do to save the world,\" China's negotiator told other diplomats during negotiations on the finance target in Bonn on Tuesday. Neither camp of countries has compromised on who should pay, said Joe Thwaites, who tracks climate finance negotiations for the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council.  \"Negotiations were difficult and things are moving slowly,\" he said. As talks continue beyond Bonn, some negotiators said government ministers could raise the issue at higher level meetings such as G20 ministers' gatherings in Brazil ahead of COP29. ",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's infrastructure companies will need to invest between $190 billion and $215 billion in the next seven years to meet the country's goal of achieving 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030, according to estimates from ratings agency Moody's. An additional $150 billion to $170 billion will be required for the expansion and enhancement of electricity transmission, distribution, and energy storage systems.Abhishek Tyagi, a Vice President and Senior Credit Officer, Moody's, noted, \"The sizeable pipeline of announced projects will keep the financial leverage of renewable power companies rated by Moody&rsquo;s high over the next 2-3 years &ndash; a credit negative &ndash; but the leverage of government-related issuers will remain moderate over the same period, given their relatively strong balance sheets.\"While India is aggressively expanding its renewable energy capacities, Tyagi added, \"We expect the strong growth in India's renewable energy capacity to continue, although coal will remain a major source of electricity generation over the next 8-10 years.\"Government policies and stable regulatory frameworks are expected to support the credit quality of these investments. These policies have already assisted in increasing the share of renewable energy to about 43 per cent of India's total power capacity mix in fiscal 2023 and 2024, contributing significantly towards the country&rsquo;s 2030 transition targets and its 2070 net-zero ambitions.Simultaneously, ICRA, an affiliate of Moody&rsquo;s in India, predicts increased spending on transportation infrastructure, with significant investments expected in roads, ports, and airports. The Ministry of Roads, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has seen its budgetary allocation for the road sector rise to INR 2.7 lakh crore in fiscal 2025, marking a 22 per cent compound annual growth rate over the past decade.Girishkumar Kadam, ICRA&rsquo;s Senior Vice President and Group Head, Corporate Ratings, said, \"India&rsquo;s road construction is expected to grow by 5 per cent-8 per cent to between 12,500 km and 13,000 km in fiscal 2025, following a robust expansion of around 20 per cent in fiscal 2024.\"Investments in airport infrastructure are also on the rise, with around INR 55,000 crore to INR 60,000 crore committed over the next 3-4 years for the development of new greenfield airports, as well as expansions and enhancements of existing facilities.Overall passenger traffic at airports is forecasted to increase by 8 per cent-11 per cent to between 407 million and 418 million passengers in fiscal 2025, supported by a resurgence in both leisure and business travel, as well as increased international connectivity. Additionally, India's rapid digitalization is expected to drive approximately INR 1.5 lakh crore into investments in data centers over the next 5-6 years, boosting the country's digital infrastructure capabilities.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The PLI scheme is expected to attract investments of Rs 3-4 lakh crore in the next four years and generate 2 lakh jobs as large projects in sectors, including semiconductor, solar module and pharmaceutical intermediaries, are expected to take off, a top Icra executive said on Wednesday. Icra Executive Vice President and Chief Ratings Officer K Ravichandran said that going ahead private sector capex is expected to pick up in oil and gas, metals and mining, hospitals, healthcare and cement sectors.  However, taking the private sector capex to record high levels would require the government to give some tax breaks so that people have more disposable income in their hands.  \"Under the PLI scheme, we are expecting Rs 3-4 lakh crore of additional investments in the next 3-4 years. Going ahead, semiconductor, solar module, and pharmaceutical intermediaries are some areas where large projects are expected to happen which can be capital and employment-intensive. They would be generating 2 lakh jobs in different sectors,\" Ravichandran told PTI in an interview.  The PLI scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors, including telecommunication, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell batteries, drones, and pharma, with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.  PLI schemes have witnessed over Rs 1.03 lakh crore of investment till November 2023, and employment generation of over 6.78 lakh.  With regard to private sector capex, Ravichandran said private capex pickup is expected in oil and gas, metals and mining hospitals, healthcare, and cement. These are the sectors that are expecting large outlay over the medium term. However, unlike earlier years, this time the capex is more towards the green energy side, renewable energy and electric vehicles.  \"For us to reach a high level of capex we need to do something on the demand front. Consumption at the lower end of the market, in rural areas, is subdued. On the demand front, we need to do more through tax incentives or other means...,\" he said.  Capacity utilisation in various industries is hovering around 75 per cent for quite some time and demand push would be key to go to the next level of investments in the private capex front.  Ravichandran said that the government is unlikely to change the Rs 11.11 lakh crore public sector capex spending budgeted for the current fiscal.  \"I don't think infra spending will go up from the current level. The government will adhere to the fiscal consolidation path. Going up on the budgetary outlay for infrastructure is going to be difficult given the need to reduce the debt level...So the private sector will have to pick up the tab,\" he said.  The government's capex allocation has more than doubled from Rs 4.39 lakh crore in the 2020-21 fiscal, to Rs 11 lakh crore in 2024-25.  Although in monetary terms, the capex allocation in the budget has increased in percentage terms, the increase in allocation has decelerated in 2024-25 to 11 per cent, from around 35 per cent in the previous three financial years.",

            "articleBody": "COPENHAGEN: Renewable energy group Orsted will install a Tesla Megapack battery storage system linked to Britain's Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm, the Danish company said on Wednesday. Energy storage is becoming increasingly important as production of renewable energy rises, because the wind might not blow or the sun shine during the peak hours when most consumers turns on their lights and appliances. \"The battery will help ensure that renewable energy is used in the best possible way by storing it when demand is lower and then releasing it back into the system when it's really needed,\" Orsted's UK and Ireland chief Duncan Clark said in a statement. This would help reduce price volatility for consumers by making more power available, including during peak periods when energy is traditionally more expensive, Orsted said. The system, set to be operational by 2026, will be co-located with the onshore converter station at Swardeston in eastern England, and will have a capacity of 600 MWh, equivalent to the daily energy usage of 80,000 UK homes. Orsted did not disclose the size of the battery investment. ",

            "articleBody": "SHANGHAI: Chinese solar panel manufacturers said they are seeking immediate government intervention to curb investment and industry collaboration to arrest a plunge in prices of solar cells and modules, as the industry faces overcapacity. Financial incentives and a government push have helped China become the solar panel factory of the world, accounting for about 80% of global module capacity. Analysts expect Chinese manufacturers to add up to 600 gigawatts (GW) this year, enough to meet global demand through 2032. However, with no end in sight for the plunge in prices, industry officials and analysts said intense competition was threatening to drive smaller producers into bankruptcy. Rapid capacity additions drove down prices of China's finished solar panels by 42% last year. \"Survive - that's the goal,\" Li Gang, chairman of Seraphim Energy Group said at the International Solar Photovoltaic and Smart Energy conference on Tuesday. Between June 2023 and February 2024, at least eight companies cancelled or suspended more than 59 GW of new production capacity, equivalent to 6.9% of China's total finished panel production capacity in 2023, according to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA). \"We need to join our forces together to avoid overinvestment,\" Gao Jifan, chairman and CEO of Trina Solar and honorary president of CPIA told the conference. Gao sought government regulation of new investment in the sector to plug further losses, while SiNeng Electric's president Duan Yuhe asked the Chinese state planner to intervene. Gongshan Zhu, chair of the Asian Photovoltaic Industry Association, warned new companies against rushing into the sector, saying industry profits had plunged 70% due to overcapacity and falling prices, while exports were curbed by trade barriers imposed by the United States. \"If you're just a copycat, it will not be sustainable for you,\" Zhu said, adding that the situation has been exacerbated by local governments investing for the sake of boosting employment. Industry executives speaking at the conference also called for an end to race-to-the-bottom price competition, and suggested bidding processes take into account levels of research and development, instead of just pricing. Some company officials, such as Wuxi Suntech Power Chairman Fei Wu, said consolidation had already begun. The industry's prospects were expected to worsen this year and more small companies were likely to go out of business, he added. ",

The focus will primarily be on expanding renewable energy capacity and integrating advanced technologies to stabilize the grid.Anujesh Dwivedi, Partner at Deloitte India, outlined several steps critical to reaching the 500 GW renewable energy capacity target. \"To accelerate renewable energy capacity addition, achieving the goal of 500 GW RE capacity by 2030 will necessitate additional measures beyond current interventions,\" Dwivedi noted. He emphasized the need for corporate RE procurement through Green Open Access, continuous support for RE manufacturing, and dedicated programs for new solar applications. The implementation of Distributed RE Obligation (DREO) and facilitating easier access to green finance were also highlighted as key measures.Furthermore, Dwivedi mentioned the importance of investments in power distribution networks to manage the rising frequency of extreme weather events and downstream distribution network overloading. He also stressed the need for grid automation to integrate large-scale distributed renewable energy and electric vehicles effectively. \"An announcement has been made for the addition of 80,000 MW of new coal-based thermal power plants by 2031-32,\" he added, indicating upcoming implementation measures.On the service front, Dwivedi suggested a transformation in customer service orientation of State DISCOMs, proposing a reform akin to the Passport Seva Kendra model to enhance customer interactions.Echoing the sentiment of robust policy frameworks, Pratik Agarwal, MD, Sterlite Power and Chairman, Serentica Renewables, praised the previous term's efforts in advancing green energy initiatives and transmission development. \"I extend my congratulations to the Ministry for their commendable efforts over the past five years,\" said Agarwal. He expressed his anticipation for continued policy support to ensure a comprehensive turnaround of discoms and extend the ISTS waiver to sustain renewable energy adoption.In addition, a Power Ministry official commented on the strategic focus for the upcoming term. \"The next phase is about consolidating our gains in the renewable sector and ensuring our grid is robust enough to handle this transition. We are looking at enhancing our interconnectors with neighboring nations and investing in energy storage solutions,\" the official stated.With a combination of new and ongoing projects, including the integration of innovative technologies like Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs), the ministry aims to diversify India's energy mix and prepare for large-scale renewable energy integration.",

The surge in power consumption was driven by severe and prolonged heatwaves across the country and strong manufacturing activity. The demand in May marks a significant rise compared to the same period in 2023.The peak demand for electricity also hit historic highs, reaching 250 gigawatts (GW) on May 30, further underscored by rising temperatures that soared to 50.5 degrees Celsius in Churu, Rajasthan on May 29. The intense heat significantly increased the usage of cooling equipment, contributing to the spike in power consumption.In addition to the weather, manufacturing activity remained robust, with the Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index (PMI) comfortably above the expansionary mark of 50, recording figures of 58.8 and 57.5 in April and May respectively. This industrial vigor played a crucial role in the increased power demand from the commercial and industrial sectors.Reflecting on the impact of these trends, a CRISIL analyst said, \"Power demand is likely to have grown about 13 per cent compared with April-May 2023. Indeed, in May, power demand is estimated to have surged to around 156 billion units, logging a roughly 15 per cent on-year increase.\"This record demand highlights the challenges and pressures on India's power grid, emphasizing the need for robust infrastructure and energy management strategies to handle such peak loads, particularly during extreme weather conditions.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Global hydropower capacity grew by 13.5GW to 1,412GW in 2023, with pumped storage hydropower (PSH) increasing by 6.5GW to 182GW, according to the latest World Hydropower Outlook published by the International Hydropower Association (IHA). Despite this growth, the report indicates a downward trend, risking the achievement of global decarbonization targets by 2050.A growth rate of just over 26GW per year from now to 2030 is needed to meet net zero targets. \"Hydropower is the backbone to a reliable energy and water system. As well as providing electricity, it provides storage, flexibility, reliability to support solar/wind, access to clean water, irrigation, and drought and flood control,\" said Eddie Rich, CEO of IHA.To double hydropower capacity by 2050, a cumulative investment of approximately US$3.7 trillion is required, or about US$130 billion annually, more than double the current level of funding. \"Whether we like it or not, more droughts and floods due to climate change will mean an increased need to invest in water infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs. Where possible these should be powered,\" Rich added.The IHA&rsquo;s assessment of the &ldquo;big 100&rdquo; pipeline of projects under development indicates that this acceleration is within reach for the early years of the next decade, but more action is needed to raise this rate of delivery further. Malcolm Turnbull, IHA President, stated, \"The more variable power that is developed through solar and wind, the more hydropower will be required to provide balance and flexibility when the wind doesn&rsquo;t blow, and the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine.\"Globally, China, Brazil, the US, Canada, and Russia were the top five countries for installed hydropower capacity in 2023. Almost half of the new installed capacity was in China. In Africa, hydropower already provides 40% of sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s power, but 90% of the continent&rsquo;s potential remains untapped. South America relies on hydropower for 45% of its electricity supply, with over 13GW of projects in the pipeline.",

This growth was led primarily by electric two-wheelers (E2Ws) and electric three-wheelers (E3Ws), which contributed 94 per cent of the total EV sales across all categories for the year.E2Ws emerged as the frontrunners, with sales totaling 1,009,356 units, indicating a notable y-o-y growth of 29 per cent. This category constituted a substantial 57.60 per cent share of the overall EV sales in FY2024. The rise in E2W penetration was mainly attributed to increased awareness and the introduction of improved product models comparable to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.E3Ws, both passenger and cargo, showcased a remarkable 56 per cent y-o-y growth, registering sales of 634,969 units in FY2024. This segment stands out as the most electrified, with an overall 52.34 per cent EV penetration in the three-wheeler category. \"Favorable cost economics, increasing logistic demand, and enhanced demand for last-mile mobility have driven growth in this segment,\" the report noted.The electric car (E-Car) category saw sales reach 99,085 units, indicating a remarkable y-o-y growth of 82 per cent in FY2024. Despite the consistent upward trend in sales since FY2021, the level of electrification penetration has remained relatively unchanged due to the concurrent increase in the number of ICE buses.Electric bus (E-Bus) sales totaled 3,708 units during FY2024, demonstrating the highest y-o-y growth of 85 per cent. However, the report noted that despite this consistent upward trend, the level of electrification penetration has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years.Karnataka led in E2W penetration with 11.63 per cent, in the E-Car category with 4.24 per cent electrification, and in the E-Bus category with 9.77 per cent among the top five states. Uttar Pradesh had the highest three-wheeler passenger electrification rate, with approximately 84 per cent of the category electrified. Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh each surpassed 60 per cent electrification in the three-wheeler cargo category in FY2024.",

He was accompanied by his wife, daughter and son-in-law.  Before taking charge, the minister along with his family members took off his footwear and offered prayers.    Pralhad Joshi, RSS loyalist &amp; five-time MP, returns as union ministerPralhad Joshi, a fifth time BJP MP from Dharwad, Karnataka, close to PM Narendra Modi and BJP leader Amit Shah, played a key role in passing crucial bills during 17th Lok Sabha.See More Details Speaking to reporters, Joshi said under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a lot of development has happened in this sector and the country stands fourth globally in renewable energy in terms of installed capacity.  \"The PM has put faith in me to lead this department and I will try to work hard to live up to his expectations,\" he said.  On the priorities for the sector, he said, \"This (new and renewable) sector is already contributing towards India's energy security, and we will work in this direction. I will also review the 100-day plan which has now changed to 125 days.\"  A long-time BJP worker, Joshi, was allocated the portfolio of New &amp; Renewable Energy on Monday in the Narendra Modi-led NDA government.    Old team, new beginnings: Big four intact, PM Modi sends big messageBesides big four, PM's core team of ministers have also retained their portfolios. Nitin Gadkari (road transport and highways), Piyush Goyal (commerce and industry), Dharmendra Pradhan (education), Sarbananda Sonowal (ports, shipping and waterways), Virendra Kumar (social justice and empowerment), Ashwini Vaishnaw (railways, electronics and information technology), Hardeep Puri (petroleum and natural gas) and Bhupender Yadav (environment, forest and climate change) will continue running the ministries they were handling in the last five years. Some of them have shed additional portfolios that were allocated when others left the council of ministers in the past.See More Details He replaces R K Singh who lost the Lok Sabha election from the Arrah constituency.  Joshi is a five-time member of Parliament from the saffron party's bastion of Dharwad in Karnataka.

            "articleBody": "Islamabad: The World Bank has approved an additional loan of USD 1 billion for cash-strapped Pakistan to support the China-backed Dasu hydropower project in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. According to a report in the Express Tribune newspaper, this constitutes the third major financing by the global lender for the project, which earlier secured USD 588.4 million for preparatory works and an additional USD 700 million for constructing the transmission line to transmit electricity from the project.  The Dasu hydropower project, situated approximately 300 km north of Islamabad in the unruly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, is being developed by China Gezhouba with funding from the global lender and has endured at least two deadly terrorist attacks targeting Chinese nationals involved in its construction.  The World Bank in a press release on Monday said it has approved USD 1 billion additional financing for the DASU Hydropower Stage I (DHP I) Project.  \"This financing will support the expansion of hydropower electricity supply, improve access to socio-economic services for local communities, and build the Water and Power Development Authority's (WAPDA) capacity to prepare future hydropower projects,\" it said.  Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, said the country's energy sector suffers from multiple challenges to achieve affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.  \"The DASU Hydropower Project site is one of the best hydropower sites in the world and is a game changer for the Pakistan energy sector. With a very small footprint, the DHP will contribute to 'greening' the energy sector and lowering the cost of electricity,\" he said in the release.  The World Bank said upon completion, the hydropower plant will have an installed capacity of 4,320-5,400 MW.  \"DHP-I is an essential project in Pakistan's efforts to reverse its dependence on fossil fuels and reach 60 per cent renewable energy by 2031,\" said Rikard Liden, Task Team Leader for the project.  The additional financing will facilitate the expansion of electricity supply and potentially save Pakistan an estimated USD 1.8 billion annually by replacing imported fuels, and offset around 5 million tons of carbon dioxide, he said.  \"The annual economic return of DHP-I is estimated to be around 28 per cent,\" the press release quoted Liden as saying.  In March, a suicide attack claimed the lives of five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver at the project site. In July 2021, ten Chinese nationals were killed and 26 others injured in a suicide attack on a bus en route to the Dasu Hydropower Project.  Cash-strapped Pakistan provided USD 11.6 million in compensation to the Chinese nationals affected by the terrorist incidents.  China Gezhouba Group Company (CGGC) serves as the contractor for the Dasu Hydropower Project.  Pakistan urgently requires cheaper electricity resources to reduce reliance on expensive imported fuel-based power generation. High electricity costs have prompted households, factories, mosques, and hospitals to turn to solar power generation, increasing the burden on those still connected to the national grid, the Express Tribune newspaper reported.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Modi government will continue to balance development with environmental protection and conservation, Bhupender Yadav said on Tuesday after taking over as Union Environment minister. Yadav's role as Environment minister will be crucial as India proposes to host the international climate talks (COP33) in 2028. If accepted, it would be the next major global conference in India after the G20 Summit last year.  Listing the major achievements of the Modi-led government, which enters its third consecutive term, he said, \"India met the quantitative and qualitative targets set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - the national climate plan to achieve Paris Agreement goals - nine years ahead of schedule.\"  \"Our achievements in emission reduction and the renewable energy sector are significant milestones of the Modi government over the past decade,\" Yadav told reporters. The minister, who also expressed satisfaction with the progress of the cheetah project, said Prime Minister Modi launched Mission Life at COP26 in Glasgow to promote mindful consumption of resources and called upon people to plant one tree each in the name of their mother to address rising temperatures, desertification, and biodiversity challenges. \"Both planting trees and protecting them are important,\" he said. He said that India marked 50 years of Project Tiger and 30 years of Project Elephant last year and initiated the MISHTI programme to protect mangrove ecosystems.  According to Yadav, India has implemented crucial reforms in the environment sector and launched several key initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilience and Infrastructure and International Big Cat Alliance. India achieved two quantifiable targets under its first NDCs -- reducing GDP emissions intensity by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels, and achieving 40 per cent installed power capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030. Both were ahead of schedule. The country now aims to reduce emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels and achieve 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. It has also committed to becoming a net-zero economy by 2070.  Kirtivardhan Singh, the BJP MP from Gonda and a first-time minister in the Modi government, has been appointed Union minister of state for Environment. Yadav, who took over as Environment minister from Prakash Javadekar in the second Modi government in July 2021, defended India's dependence on coal at international climate talks in Glasgow and Dubai. He previously served as the Union Labour and Employment minister, a portfolio now allotted to Mansukh Mandaviya. Under Yadav's leadership in the Environment ministry, India's climate actions were rated the fourth strongest in an annual performance index released by Germanwatch in 2023, an improvement of one place from the year before. His accomplishments also include a ban on identified single-use plastic items, and an increase in Ramsar sites - wetlands of international importance - in India. The country made significant amendments to forest, wildlife, and environmental laws during his previous term, some of which drew criticism from opposition parties and environmentalists.",

JA Solar is leading the charts followed by Trina Solar and Jinko Solar at the second and third position.The research firm evaluated over 30 solar PV module manufacturers on nine different criteria, including module manufacturing experience, vertical integration, financial performance, capacity utilisation, and more, said the official press release.The report said that eight out of the 12 ranked module manufacturers are self-sufficient in cell capacity. Tongwei and Risen are the only manufacturers in the ranking that were fully vertically integrated through the whole supply chain from polysilicon to module, it added.According to the report, seven out of the 12 ranked manufacturers are each expected to exceed 100 GW of module production capacity by 2027. The total capacity of wafers and cells of the top 10 ranked companies is expected to reach 830 GW in the next three years, which is enough to satisfy global demand twice.&ldquo;In terms of capacity and growth rate, 10 out of the 12 manufacturers had over 100 per cent growth in the past four years,&rdquo; stated the report.The report found that the top 10 ranked manufacturers continue to expand despite the oversupply of manufacturing capacity. At the same time, manufacturers are focused on becoming more vertically integrated.&ldquo;Our new module manufacturer ranking comes at an optimal time in the evolution of the solar PV supply chain. Manufacturing capacity across the global solar value chain has expanded dramatically, as we&rsquo;ve reported for over a year,&rdquo; said Yana Hryshko, head of solar supply chain at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report.Hryshko said that the ranking reflects a comprehensive summary of the most important criteria that buyers care about when purchasing solar PV modules. The scoring criteria focuses on the items that buyers ask about most frequently in their requests for quotations or requests for proposals, she added.",

            "articleBody": "TWIN FALLS: The federal Bureau of Land Management's preferred alternative for a proposed large-scale wind energy farm in southern Idaho would shrink its size by nearly half and move it farther from a national historic site.  The proposed Lava Ridge wind farm has drawn opposition from government leaders, local ranchers, and people who have said, among other things, that the project endangers the Minidoka National Historic Site, where Japanese Americans were detained during World War II. The agency detailed its preferred alternative to the original plan in its final environmental review released last week. It would decrease the number of wind turbines to 241 from 400 and cap the maximum height of the electricity-generating turbines at 660 feet (201 meters), KTVB-TV reported.  The plan also places the closest turbine to the historic site at 9 miles (14 kilometers) away. The agency said adjusting the corridor configuration aims to help \"preserve the visitor experience of the remote nature of the former incarceration site.\" As proposed in 2020, it would have been built within about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) of the visitor center for the historic site. Nonprofit organization, Friends of the Minidoka, is one group that has been concerned the project could destroy the the experience they want to preserve at the site. Robyn Achilles, the organization's executive director, said in a statement that most of the detailed historical research provided by the group to the Biden administration to enable them to better protect the historic site was disregarded in this decision.  The Biden administration \"needs to do a better job and make a real commitment to protect Minidoka and our heritage, or we will be dealing with Lava Ridge and other projects forever,\" Achilles said.  Idaho Republicans U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson and U.S. Sen. Jim Risch both expressed their continued opposition to the project in social media posts last week. Risch said he would continue to fight what he called an \"unnecessary and ill-begotten project.\" The Biden Administration has prioritized permitting renewable energy projects on public lands by 2025 as part of its response to climate change. Magic Valley Energy, which is a subsidiary of New York-based LS Power, proposed the Lava Ridge energy project and has said it would increase economic activity in the area in part by creating jobs and increasing local government tax revenues. Luke Papez, senior director of project development for LS Power, said in a statement that the agency's new preferred alternative appears to strike an appropriate balance between the protection of environmental resources and the need for additional domestic energy production. The Bureau of Land Management released its draft environmental impact statement in early 2023 with two preferred alternatives. A 90-day comment period then generated more than 11,000 public comments and 1,400 scoping comments, officials said. The final environmental review's preferred alternative decreases the \"area disturbed\" by nearly 50%, from 8,395 acres to 4,492 acres (3,397 hectares to 1,817 hectares).  \"The preferred alternative also reduces potential impacts to sage grouse, large wildlife migration routes and winter concentration areas, cultural resources, Jerome County Airport and agricultural aviation uses, public land ranchers, and adjacent private landowners,\" BLM's news release said.  If the new preferred alternative is selected, BLM estimates the project's construction to generate $21.9 million in tax revenue annually and contribute $138.9 million in total economic output. The BLM said the preferred alternative was created through engagement with landowners, ranchers, Tribal Nations, federal, state and county elected leaders, organizations, the BLM's Resource Advisory Council for the area and the National Park Service.  Without any changes, the Bureau of Land Management's preferred alternative would be finalized in July.",

            "articleBody": "TOKYO: Battery storage company Eku Energy aims to expand its global energy storage capacity to 9 gigawatt-hours by 2028 from about 1.3 GWh now, to help hasten the energy transition and maximise the use of renewables, the head of its Japanese unit said. Eku Energy, jointly owned by Macquarie Group's green investment fund and Canadian pension fund British Columbia Investment Management, in April announced its first project in Japan to build a 30 megawatts/120 MWh battery energy storage system in Miyazaki prefecture on the southern island of Kyushu. As resource-poor Japan expands renewable energy to meet decarbonisation goals and enhance energy security, battery usage is expected to rise to smooth out the intermittent supply of solar and wind energy. Eku Energy has agreed a 20-year offtake agreement for the latest project with utility Tokyo Gas. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year, with an aim to begin operation in July 2026. It is capable of storing enough electricity to power about 63,000 households for four hours. \"We are targeting to expand our battery energy storage system capacity worldwide to 9 GWh by 2028, up from the current around 1.3 GWh already in operation or announced,\" Kentaro Ono, Eku Energy Japan's managing director, told Reuters last week. The company is developing energy storage in Britain, Australia, Italy and Japan. There is no Japan-specific target, but Eku Energy aims to develop a significant number of projects because the country is the world's fourth-largest electricity consumer and a power trading market system is being put in place, Ono said. Battery storage is expanding rapidly worldwide, led by China and the United States. Japan, which lags behind, is expected to see growth thanks to government support and institutional changes such as the development of a market for adjusting electricity supply and demand. In Japan, as renewable energy deployment expands, output cut requests from utilities to balance power supply and demand have become more frequent nationwide, wasting potential clean energy that could otherwise be utilised.",

            "articleBody": "HANOI/HOA BINH: Lights are off and air conditioning is down at the headquarters of Vietnam's state-run electricity provider EVN as the country's top power utility tries to \"lead by example\" to avoid a repeat of last year's crippling blackouts, an official tells visitors. But many businesses around Vietnam's capital Hanoi appear to be ignoring the call to conserve power, keeping decorative but otherwise purposeless neon lights on the outside of high-rise buildings on all night. The difficulties in curtailing consumption illustrate the challenges facing Vietnam a year after sudden outages caused losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to multinational manufacturers with investments in the Southeast Asian country. Vietnam is pursuing a patchwork agenda of energy-saving measures, grid upgrades, regulatory reforms and a massive increase of coal power as it seeks to avert electricity shortfalls, according to government data and interviews with officials and experts. But Trinh Mai Phuong, EVN's communications director, explains during a media visit that even the biggest infrastructure upgrade underway, a new $1 billion transmission line connecting the centre of the country to the highly industrialised north that was hard hit by blackouts last year, may not be enough. \"I would not say it is a game changer,\" he said of the line that could be completed as early as this month, noting power consumption is expected to hit record highs in the coming weeks as the country braces for more heatwaves. The soaring power demand is making it increasingly difficult for Vietnam to meet climate change commitments while providing enough power to satisfy large investors such as Samsung Electronics, Foxconn and Canon. Broader sector-wide reforms are needed over the longer term, foreign investors and analysts said. EMERGENCY MEASURES In the short term, Vietnam is banking mostly on coal to provide enough reliable electricity. It may be just enough - or not - but either way it may signal a blow to the country's commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Coal use rose massively in the first five months of 2024, with coal-fired power plants accounting on average for 59% of electricity output, exceeding 70% some days, according to EVN data. That was up from nearly 45% in the same period last year and 41% in 2021, when Vietnam began drafting plans to cut coal that persuaded international donors to commit $15.5 billion to help phase out the fuel. Thanks to a new coal-fired power plant that came online in 2023, coal accounted for 33% of total installed capacity last year, up from 30.8% in 2020, taking Vietnam further away from the goal of lowering that to 20% by 2030. Energy conservation is another key pillar of the plan. EVN and its local units have encouraged energy-hungry clients, including foreign manufacturers, to save power with tailored measures, especially in peak hours. But that risks Vietnam's reputation as a reliable place for investment and could affect future manufacturing expansion plans, according to foreign investors who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media. The matter should be addressed by solving generation and distribution issues, and not from the consumption side, two foreign investors said. Vietnam's industry ministry did not reply to a request for comment. CLEANER OPTIONS Vietnam is using only a fraction of its installed solar and onshore wind capacity due largely to administrative hurdles. It has not approved regulations to kick-start offshore wind projects and delays dog projects to build power plants fuelled by imported liquefied natural gas, which is cleaner than coal. The four energy sources together should account for more than 40% of installed capacity by 2030, according to the government's plans, though analysts are sceptical. Hydropower is projected to fall to less than 20% of installed power generation by the end of decade from more than 30% in 2020. But some capacity is being added in the north where needs are higher. One of Vietnam's largest hydropower plants at Hoa Binh is adding two General Electric turbines to its existing eight, which will boost its total capacity to 2.4 gigawatts from less than 2 GW now by the second half of 2025, said Dao Trong Sang, EVN's manager of the expansion project, during a visit to the dam. The Hoa Binh plant, combined with the new transmission line that brings electricity to the north from separate plants, may add 8% capacity to the power-hungry north.  REFORMS NEEDED The power crisis cannot be solved without long-awaited reforms, experts say, though progress to date has been slow. In April, the industry ministry issued an updated methodology for determining electricity prices, a step towards possibly reviving projects stuck for years because of a lack of clarity about tariffs. However, the methodology could force developers to shoulder excessive risk, complicating their access to finance, said a Vietnam-based official who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media. A separate draft decree enabling manufacturers to buy electricity directly from producers is seen as close to approval after years of internal debate, according to several analysts. The use of direct power purchase agreements (DPPAs) could make it easier for multinational companies to avoid higher tariffs on exports and boost the use of renewables to help them meet environmental, social and governance requirements. But the DPPA rules need to be combined with other reforms, such as clearer provisions to directly connect factories to power-generation projects, the official said.",

            "articleBody": "Investment in clean energy technologies will climb to $2 trillion this year, almost double the amount spent on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency.Two-thirds of the record $3 trillion invested in energy sources in 2024 will be devoted to sectors such as renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and efficiency, even as higher financing costs hinder projects, the Paris-based agency said. The remaining $1 trillion will go to coal, gas and oil &mdash; a level that&rsquo;s still too high to conform with global climate goals. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached an important landmark,&rdquo; IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in an interview as the agency published its annual World Energy Investment report. &ldquo;Clean energy investment is setting new records even in challenging economic conditions.&rdquo; Combined investment in renewable power and grids has overtaken the amount spent on fossil fuels for the first time. Some green projects have been impeded by rising interest rates, but this been offset by &ldquo;easing supply chain pressures and falling prices,&rdquo; the IEA said in its report. The growth is &ldquo;underpinned by strong economics, by continued cost reductions and by considerations of energy security&rdquo; heightened by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, it added. Solar power is leading power&rsquo;s sector&rsquo;s transformation, with investment in the area set to reach $500 billion this year &mdash; more than the money flowing into all other electricity generation technologies combined. Total investment in renewables and nuclear power for electricity generation has reached 10 times the amount directed at fossil fuel-fired generation, according to the report. When the Paris agreement on climate change was struck in 2015, that ratio stood at two-to-one.&ldquo;We see renewed momentum in nuclear power investments,&rdquo; Birol added.Developing EconomiesChina will account for the largest share of clean energy investment, with around $675 billion this year, as a result of strong domestic demand for solar power, lithium batteries and electric vehicles, according to the report. Still, clean energy investment in other emerging and developing economies remains low at about $320 billion, accounting for just 15% of the global total, it said. Nonetheless, the expansion of fossil fuel demand continues at a pace that leaves the world on track for potentially catastrophic climate change. Investment in new oil and gas supplies will increase by 7% this year to $570 billion, mostly concentrated in national oil companies in the Middle East and Asia, according to the report. In order to reach the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2025 &mdash; and limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels &mdash; spending on fossil fuels would need to be halved, while an additional $500 billion per year would need to be spent on renewables. &ldquo;When we look at these trends it is definitely encouraging, but they fall short,&rdquo; Birol warned. &ldquo;We are far from reaching the 1.5 degrees trajectory.&rdquo;",

Building on this foundation, Astik Mani Tripathi, Promoter and Director of GP ECO, anticipates that the Modi 3.0 administration will prioritize incentivizing private sector investments in large-scale battery energy storage systems, which are essential for enhancing the stability and resilience of renewable energy integration. &ldquo;With last year&rsquo;s peak energy demand hitting 250 GW due to unprecedented summer temperatures, and a significant contribution from solar and wind energy, it is paramount that such incentives are strategically implemented,&rdquo; Tripathi added.Anirudh Saraswat, Founder of Oriana Power, outlined comprehensive expectations from the government that include policy stability and support through consistent tariffs, subsidies, and incentives that encourage long-term renewable investments. &ldquo;We also need robust infrastructure development particularly in modernizing the national grid to handle increased renewable inputs, and easier access to financing through green bonds and low-interest loans from government-backed financial institutions,&rdquo; Saraswat elaborated. He also called for regulatory frameworks that accommodate emerging sectors like Compressed Biogas (CBG), Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), and green hydrogen, alongside stringent sustainability regulations to promote circular economy practices.Echoing the need for a supportive framework, Amit Jain, CEO and Country Manager of Engie India, emphasized the critical role of governmental policies in fostering a conducive environment for the growth of renewables, particularly solar energy, which is central to achieving Engie&rsquo;s ambitious goal of Net Zero Carbon by 2045. &ldquo;We look forward to regulatory simplifications that facilitate the seamless integration of renewable sources into the national grid, enhancing energy security and system stability,&rdquo; said Jain.Mahesh Girdhar, Managing Director &amp; CEO of EverEnviro Resource Management Private Ltd, stressed the importance of the government&rsquo;s role in facilitating low-cost funding and creating risk-sharing facilities to address the high capital and operational costs in the renewables sector. &ldquo;With robust economic growth forecasts for India from 2024-2028, it&rsquo;s crucial that the government prioritizes renewable energy, invests in technological innovation, and fosters public-private partnerships to build a cleaner and more sustainable India,&rdquo; he noted.Anujesh Dwivedi, Partner at Deloitte India, pointed out the achievements in addressing the demand-supply gap without significantly adding thermal capacity in the last five years. &ldquo;With the sharp rise in peak demand driven by economic growth and extreme weather patterns, it&rsquo;s now essential to focus on adding firm and dispatchable power. The government's plan to add 80 GW of new coal-based TPPs by 2031-32 requires a slew of policy measures for effective implementation,&rdquo; explained Dwivedi.Collectively, these industry leaders' insights reflect a pressing call for Modi 3.0 to implement strategic, supportive actions that would significantly advance India's renewable energy capabilities, aligning with global environmental goals and the nation&rsquo;s sustainable development agenda.",

            "articleBody": "MELBOURNE: Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on Monday said the opposition Liberal Party would renege on the nation's ambitious target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 if it wins elections due within a year. Albanese made Australian action on climate change an issue in elections due by next May in response to comments made by Peter Dutton, leader of the conservative opposition party. Dutton said in an interview with the newspaper that he opposed the centre-left Labour Party government's plan to reduce emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by the end of the decade, saying there was \"no sense in signing up to targets you don't have any prospects of achieving.\" Albanese said Australia would achieve the target despite a forecast by the Climate Change Authority, a government agency, last November of a reduction of between 37 per cent and 42 per cent. \"Peter Dutton is walking away from climate action. His decision to abandon the 2030 target means him walking away from the Paris Accord,\" Albanese told reporters, referring to the agreement struck by governments at a United Nations climate conference in Paris in 2015. \"If you walk away from the Paris Accord, you'll be standing with Libya, Yemen, and Iran, and against all of our major trading partners and all of our important allies,\" Albanese said. Opposition climate and energy spokesperson Ted O'Brien said Dutton was acknowledging that Australia would not meet the 43 per cent target that Parliament enshrined into law in September 2022. Parliament made the target a law to increase the degree of difficulty for any future government that wanted a less ambitious target. The Liberal Party will reveal its reduction target for 2030 closer to the next election, which Albanese could call from late 2024, O'Brien said. \"We are absolutely committed to the Paris Agreement. We are absolutely committed to achieving net-zero by 2050, and we will have a plan to do so,\" O'Brien told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \"What we have done is we've called Labour out\" for legislating a promise the government could not keep, O'Brien added. Opposition lawmakers voted against the legislated 43 per cent reduction target. A previous Liberal Party government promised in Paris in 2015 that Australia would reduce emissions by between 26 per cent and 28 per cent by 2030. The party remained in power until it lost elections in 2022 to Albanese's government. The Liberal Party has not changed its 2030 target since Paris but has matched Labour's pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The two sides of politics are proposing different paths to meet the 2050 target. Labour is proposing more renewable energy such as solar and wind-generated electricity, while the Liberal Party is proposing Australia's first nuclear-generated electricity. ",

            "articleBody": "BRUSSELS: A more rightward-leaning European Parliament will make it harder to pass ambitious EU climate policies, but the majority of Europe's current world-leading green policies are likely to stay put, lawmakers, officials and analysts said. Provisional results in the European Parliament election on Sunday night showed centrist parties holding a majority, but gains for right-wing and far-right parties sceptical of the EU's \"Green Deal\" package of environmental policies, and heavy losses for Green parties. \"I don't think that we'll be rolling back on (climate) policies. But I do think that it will be more complicated to get new policies off the ground,\" Bas Eickhout, head of the European Parliament's Greens lawmaker group, told Reuters. EU climate measures over the next five years will depend on the incoming European Commission, which is responsible for proposing EU laws. But the newly-elected European Parliament will get a say on every new green policy. Sunday's election result signals tougher maths to approve new EU climate measures. \"All new policies will be harder to pass. But backsliding is very unlikely,\" Krzysztof Bolesta, Poland's secretary of state for climate, told Reuters. \"It is possible that new ambition will be delayed, mostly for populistic reasons,\" agreed Julian Popov, who until April was EU member Bulgaria's environment minister. That could have consequences for an upcoming 2040 EU climate target, needed to steer the EU towards its 2050 net zero emissions target. The EU Commission has suggested the 2040 goal should be an ambitious 90% emissions cut, but it needs approval from both EU countries and the Parliament. The upcoming European Commission and Parliament will also face tough decisions on whether to introduce new policies to push industries towards that 2040 target. That includes farming, a sector whose emissions have barely fallen since 2005. But after months of protests across Europe by angry farmers, there is little political appetite to target the sector with new rules, especially if the cost of complying with them would drive up food prices for citizens already dealing with the biggest jump in living costs in a generation.  NO BIG U-TURN While new climate measures might face a tougher ride, a full-scale reversal of the dozens of EU climate policies passed in the last five years would be legally difficult. Those policies - which include renewable energy targets and a strengthened carbon pricing regime on power and industry - are fixed into EU law and already being rolled-out across the bloc's 27 member states. Many are already working. EU emissions are down by nearly a third from 1990 levels, and Europe is installing wind and solar energy capacity at record speed. Still, the election campaign saw mounting calls from the right to scrap some Green Deal policies - with a prime target the EU's 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. That policy has a 2026 review clause, on which the Parliament will get a say. \"It was an ideological folly, which absolutely must be corrected,\" Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni told online magazine Open last week. Three EU diplomats singled out the 2035 car policy as one that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will face significant pressure to weaken, including from some lawmakers in her centre-right European People's Party who want it scrapped. Von der Leyen needs support from a majority of lawmakers in the new European Parliament to win a second term. But broad climate policy rollbacks are unlikely, officials and analysts said. That's partly because the EU's existing climate measures add up to deliver its 2030 climate target - to cut net greenhouse gas emissions 55% from 1990 levels - which national governments and lawmakers both approved into EU law. \"There might well be changes in individual pieces of legislation, but what will be important to watch is how this adds up,\" said Mats Engstrom, senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.  DON'T CALL IT A 'GREEN' DEAL Contrary to the last EU election in 2019, when millions of young climate protesters took to Europe's streets, this year's campaign saw climate change usurped by issues including immigration, economic woes and struggling European industries. Meeting the EU's 2030 climate target will require investments of 1 trillion euros per year, a jump of around 356 billion per year compared with 2010-2020, according to the European Investment Bank. Investing in local industries was a campaign pledge across the political spectrum, as competition sharpens with the U.S. and China to produce green tech like low-carbon steel and electric cars. Some analysts said this focus would see the EU pass more funds and policies to support climate-friendly projects - but with the focus on helping industry, rather than being \"green\" and \"clean\". \"If it's about scaling up manufacturing of green technologies here in Europe, then that may be done in the name of 'industrial competitiveness' and not for the climate,\" said Linda Kalcher, Executive Director at think-tank Strategic Perspectives. \"It might be that we see the rhetoric shifting, but the action on the ground being the same,\" Kalcher said.",

The agreements represent two of the so-called &ldquo;four pillars&rdquo; that the pact rests on.&ldquo;I wanted to demonstrate to our partners that the US doesn&rsquo;t just say what our intentions are, but we show up,&rdquo; Raimondo said. &ldquo;We need to do the hard work of identifying opportunities, making connections, and being present in the region and in Singapore we&rsquo;ve done just that.&rdquo;The IPEF is part of a sweeping effort led by US President Joe Biden to counter China&rsquo;s deep-rooted economic influence in Asia. The other participating countries include Japan, India and South Korea, which all rank among the 10 biggest national economies in the world, with the 14 nations included representing about $38 trillion in economic output.While the accord on clean economy focuses on the transition to renewable energy and fighting climate change, the one on fair economy relates to taxation and corruption issues. The stakeholders earlier agreed on the supply-chain pillar, which aims to avoid the kind of bottlenecks that occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic, but they fell short of a deal on the final trade pillar over thornier issues such as rules for digital commerce and labor.A senior US commerce official did not comment on when or indeed whether the various sides would reach a deal on the final pillar. While noting that not all partners signed the accords Thursday, the official said a couple of countries are completing domestic processes and have indicated their intention to sign off on it soon.Raimondo announced earlier Thursday that a coalition including allied climate partners, BlackRock, GIC, the Rockefeller Foundation and Temasek has committed to invest over $25 billion in capital that can be deployed in the Indo-Pacific emerging market infrastructure. She also said the countries came today identifying over $23 billion of priority infrastructure projects and US industry is directly connected with the government on those investment opportunities.Singapore&rsquo;s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong earlier in the day said at the forum that the 10-nation bloc of Southeast Asian nations is keen to deepen ties with the US to benefit from the peace and prosperity brought by America&rsquo;s presence in the region.&ldquo;For decades, America&rsquo;s presence in Asia has brought peace and prosperity and created a stable environment for countries like Singapore to prosper,&rdquo; Wong said during his remarks at the forum. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Singapore has long been an advocate for the US to actively engage the region, especially Southeast Asia.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": "Geneva: Switzerland was on Sunday on course to approve a law aimed at accelerating the development of renewable energy as the country targets carbon neutrality by 2050, a polling institute said.A first projection by the gfs.bern institute suggested 69 percent of voters backed the law on \"a secure electricity supply based on renewable energies\", confirming polling trends before the referendum.Less than two months ago Switzerland became the first nation ever to be condemned by an international court for not doing enough to combat climate change, in a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.The new law was approved by parliament last year, and most environmental organisations back the legislation and its ambitions.However, a few smaller environmental groups that oppose it managed to garner enough support to trigger a referendum.They fear it will fast-track large-scale energy projects and see Switzerland's pristine Alpine landscapes plastered with wind turbines and solar panels.They also deplore limitations on the possibilities for local residents to launch appeals against the construction of new renewable energy installations.Retired economist Pierre-Alain Bruchez, who spearheaded the referendum push, said there was \"no reason to put solar panels on mountain pastures, when there is so much space\" on buildings.He launched the battle after learning of the Grengiols-Solar project, aimed at installing around 230,000 solar panels in the mountainous Wallis canton, at an altitude of 2,500 metres, calling it a \"vision of horror\".- Largest party opposes law -Switzerland's largest party, the hard-right Swiss People's Party (SVP), opposes the law, above all in the name of defending civil nuclear power, which provided 32 percent of total energy production last year.The SVP believes renewable energies do not guarantee energy security due to their fluctuating nature.The law is backed by major non-governmental organisations such as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature.It aims to boost wind and solar power's current miniscule contribution to Switzerland's energy mix and rapidly increase hydro power production so that the wealthy landlocked country is less dependent on importing electricity.The law envisages installing solar panels on building roofs and facades.It also eases planning conditions for wind turbines and large solar installations.The government acknowledges that court appeals against large energy projects \"will probably be less likely to succeed than before\".But it stressed that projects would be examined on a case-by-case basis and constructing large installations in \"biotopes of national importance\" and migratory bird reservations will remain outlawed, albeit with some exceptions.The law also outlines 16 hydroelectric projects, a sector which last year represented 57 percent of national electricity production. These involve building new dams or heightening existing ones.- Votes on health issues -Under Switzerland's direct democracy system, citizens can trigger  votes on topics by collecting 100,000 valid signatures within 18 months. Voting takes place every three months.At the cantonal level, in the Geneva region, a big majority voted in favour of banning the exhibition or wearing of symbols of hatred, in particular Nazi symbols, in public spaces.National votes were also taking place on three popular initiatives -- topics proposed by the public -- linked to health.One aims to cap health contributions at 10 percent of income, while another is also aimed at limiting health costs, with gfs.bern saying both propositions would be rejected.A third, against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, does not mention vaccinations but demands a patient's consent be obtained for invasive procedures that may affect their physical or mental integrity -- and that a person who refuses consent may neither be penalised nor disadvantaged.But the polling institute suggested the measure found little support among the electorate with some 75 percent voting against.Geneva residents were also deciding  whether to repeal a provision preventing nursing homes from refusing to allow assisted suicide on their premises.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Known for manufacturing wind turbines, Inox Wind Ltd has incorporated four wholly-owned subsidiaries to expand its capabilities to develop wind farms across the nation, the company informed in its filing on June 8. The company said that the subsidiaries have been \"established as special purpose vehicle (SPV) companies to develop wind farms in various parts of India.\"Junachay Wind Energy Private Limited, Dharvi Kalan Wind Energy Private Limited, Dangri, Wind Energy Private Limited and Kadodiya Wind Energy Private Limited are the companies added to its list. The company informed us that all four companies incorporated in the country have paid up capital of Rs 1,00,000 each and will begin their business operations. All the entities fall within the wind power industry. The Noida-based company is a subsidiary of the INOX Group. It produces wind turbine generators (WTGs) and offers services such as wind resource evaluation, site acquisition, infrastructure development, construction and commissioning, long-term operations, and maintenance for wind power projects. It was placed 167th on Business Today's 2015 list of India's 500 most valuable companies.Last month, the company announced a consolidated profit of Rs 36.72 crore for the March quarter of the current year, reporting an increase in its income. It reported a net loss of Rs 119.04 crore in the January-March quarter of the last fiscal year, according to the company's filing. \"Q4 has been a milestone quarter for the company as we successfully transitioned to 3 MW WTG supplies from 2 MW WTGs. Our EBITDA run rate in Q4 places us on a strong footing for FY25. Our debt levels have also come down drastically and we expect to be net debt-free within H1 FY25. The macro tailwinds are reflected in the strong order book, which stands at ~ 2.7 GW today. Our other initiatives, including ramping up operations and strengthening our balance sheet, coupled with our large order book, will translate into higher order execution from FY25 onwards, resulting in strong growth in profitability,\" Kailash Tarachandani, CEO of Inox Wind had said, commenting on the fourth quarter results. Company's total income for the financial year 2024 upped to Rs 563.03 crore from Rs 193.83 crore a year ago. Inox Wind Ltd secured the single largest wind project order of 1,500 MW from power utility CESC Limited during the quarter. The company also signed an agreement for the launch of 4.X megawatt wind turbines in India. ",

            "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, heading into his third term with a weakened mandate, wants India to embrace a new &ldquo;green era&rdquo; at the forefront of climate diplomacy and clean technology.To succeed, he&rsquo;ll need to balance those ambitions against a need to sustain growth and satisfy rapidly accelerating electricity demand, leaning on a fraying power system still heavily dependent on coal.Modi, who has cast himself as climate champion for much of the past decade, will be under pressure to make faster progress toward existing green targets, including pledges to hit net zero by 2070, install a mammoth 500 gigawatts of non-fossil energy by the end of the decade, and corral a global alliance on solar power that aims to secure $1 trillion in investment.But significant expansion in clean energy &mdash; India added over 100 GW of renewable capacity during past 10 years of Modi&rsquo;s government &mdash; has not been enough to satisfy steep demand growth and the limitations of the country&rsquo;s transmission and distribution networks.    With energy security a priority, coal still accounts for roughly three-quarters of output today and its use continues to rise. India plans to add close to 90 GW of coal projects by 2032 &mdash; about 63% more than the existing blueprint, published in May 2023.New Delhi has expanded coal mining to a record, extended the lives of power plants and pressed for the softening of language around fossil fuels at international climate talks. State miner Coal India Ltd., which until the pandemic was planning to diversify into solar power, is now prioritizing the spending of record sums to expand fossil fuel output.This is unlikely to ease under a new government.According to Ashwini Swain, fellow at New Delhi-based research organization Sustainable Futures Collaborative, a more fragile and fractious coalition could be prompted to push for projects that spread largesse and earn political support. &ldquo;Protecting the fossil ecosystem may seem to be aligned with the objective,&rdquo; he said.Of course, India&rsquo;s green ambition is real and the country, among the most climate-vulnerable globally, has been experiencing more frequent instances of extreme heat and drought.A pro-poor, pro-growth agenda does not need to rely on coal, which has shown itself to be costlier and less reliable than cleaner alternatives, said independent power analyst Alexander Rutter, who is based in Bengaluru. &ldquo;There is a real opportunity for the new government to radically rethink its strategy by doubling down on renewable energy and storage rather than on investments in new, uneconomic and unreliable coal plants,&rdquo; he said.But the investment requirements are steep, especially when it comes to infrastructure changes that will underpin a transition, from overhauling mobility in sprawling cities to power networks. In 2022, India&rsquo;s electricity planners calculated that in order to reach India&rsquo;s renewable goals, the cost of laying new cables alone would be around 2.4 trillion rupees ($29 billion).Renewable projects are still often built in barren areas, far from demand centers in cities and industrial hubs, where the power is consumed.Meanwhile, the fragile financial health of distribution companies connecting homes or factories regularly deprive them of reliable supplies. A 3-trillion rupee project led by the power ministry will go some way to fixing profitability, thanks to initiatives like smart metering, but progress is slow.    One potential change for the next five years will be the role of local parties, which may ease centralization and bring regional interests up the agenda, climate analysts and researchers said &mdash; and that includes spreading green manufacturing and clean energy benefits.&ldquo;A coalition government should allow more states to make claims on the growing green economy in India,&rdquo; said Rohit Chandra, assistant professor at the IIT Delhi School of Public Policy. &ldquo;The last decade saw most of this activity in four or five states, including Gujarat and Rajasthan.&rdquo;Those two states &mdash; also bastions of support for Modi&rsquo;s party &mdash; do enjoy the lowest cost of energy generation, but poorer regions will now have a greater political role, potentially pulling investments to less affluent areas.&ldquo;If we see more decentralization and more state-led growth, you could see some of these transition policies being intertwined with bread and butter economic aspirations, including health and education,&rdquo; said Shayak Sengupta, energy and climate fellow with the Climate at Observer Research Foundation America.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Open access solar installations rose two-fold in India to 1.8 gigawatts during January-March this year supported by several factors, including reduced module cost, US-based Mercom Capital has said. Solar power through open access is an arrangement where a power producer establishes a solar power plant to supply green energy to consumers.  India added over 1.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar open access capacity in the first quarter of the calendar year of 2024, posting a two-fold increase from 909.3 megawatts (MW) in Q4 2023, the report titled 'Mercom India Solar Open Access Market' said.  As of March 2024, the cumulative installed solar open access capacity stood at 14.3 GW.  Solar open access developers benefited from lower Chinese module prices and the suspension of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) order for projects commissioned through March 2024.  Additionally, lower power purchase agreement (PPA) prices, due to reduced project costs, further incentivized consumers to adopt solar open access.  \"Demand for green energy open access, especially solar, has been mounting, driven by the financial savings and initiatives to add renewable energy in the power procurement mix.  \"An additional push comes from the corporates leading climate change mitigation strategies. If not for the regulatory restrictions, green energy open access could be the driving force that helps India meet its non-fossil fuel targets,\" said Priya Sanjay, Managing Director at Mercom India.  In Q1 2024, Rajasthan led solar open access capacity additions, accounting for almost 28 per cent followed by Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra with 21 per cent and 12 per cent of capacity additions, respectively.  The pipeline of solar open access projects under development and in the pre-construction phase was over 18 GW as of March 2024. Almost 74 per cent of pipeline projects were in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.",

            "articleBody": "KATHMANDU: Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the membership of the International Solar Alliance that will help the Himalayan nation increase usage of solar power in its effort to combat the impact due to changing climate. The House of Representatives (HoR), or the Lower House on Thursday endorsed the proposal tabled by minister for energy, water resources and irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet through a majority vote.  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilise efforts against climate change through the deployment of solar energy solutions and announced on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Paris in 2015.  With the amendment of its Framework Agreement in 2020, all member states of the United Nations are eligible to join the ISA. At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.  Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as clean energy is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.  \"The installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal's development,\" he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.  A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.  Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government's move as he said, \"This is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.\"  Currently, Nepal has 13 projects generating 68.38 MW of solar power, according to Nepal's Energy Development Department. In September 2023, Nepal announced that it plans to develop 30,000 MW of electricity by 2035 and would club hydropower and solar power.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi/Mumbai: In the face of escalating copper prices, a key material in manufacturing of power equipment, India's renewable energy sector is confronting rising costs and budgeting challenges, industry sources say. Copper, crucial for manufacturing power equipment, has seen a price surge over recent months, influenced by heightened manufacturing activity in China and the US, alongside new US sanctions on Russian copper imports.&ldquo;Over the last year, copper prices have increased by 20 per cent, driven primarily by increased manufacturing activity in China and the US, along with fresh sanctions from the US on copper sourcing from Russia&hellip; These high copper prices adversely affect project costs,&rdquo; Kannan Krishnan, joint managing director, Jakson Green, Jakson Green, a energy transition platform backed by Jakson, told ETEnergyWorld.He said that there is no mechanism in existing PPAs to cover the change in cost due to macroeconomic factors. The developers have to bear the brunt from the equity portion.  Source: The London Metal Exchange&ldquo;We have seen that there is a definite and substantial increase in the prices of balance of system (BOS) components, specifically on the transmission, structures and cables, due to the increase in the spot-prices of copper and aluminium in the international commodity market&hellip; This looks like a demand and supply issue,&rdquo; a major renewable energy project developer told ETEnergyWorld on the condition of anonymity.BOS costs include the purchase of parts, permitting, labor and installation fees, and other necessary costs of projects.According to Simarpreet Singh, executive director, Hartek Group, a Punjab-headquartered engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm, accurate cost estimates become challenging, leading to potential project delays or the need to re-negotiate terms with suppliers and clients.&ldquo;This uncertainty can disrupt project timelines and affect our reputation for reliability and timely delivery,&rdquo; he said.Copper price in the past two months from April 2024 to till date has increased by 23 per cent, increasing overall BOS cost of renewable energy projects by almost 3.5 per cent, said Ashish Kumar Saxena, chief procurement officer, AMPIN Energy Transition, a Delhi-based independent power producer.&ldquo;This is really impacting landed renewable project costs in such a competitive Indian market,&rdquo; he added.How much copper is required in renewable energy projects?Copper is an essential material in a wide range of power sector equipment, including transformers, insulators, cables, and current transformer and potential transformer.When it comes to solar projects, about five tonnes of copper is required per megawatt (MW). While onshore and offshore wind farms require 4.3 tonnes and 9.6 tonnes of copper content per MW, respectively.Why did the price rise?The reasons behind the price rise include weak US dollar which can act as a disincentive to producers to increase output and copper supply, as copper ore production is concentrated in South America, particularly in Chile which accounts for around one-third of global mined copper supply.&ldquo;The supply of copper ores, the quality of the ores and the costs of extracting them also have an impact on the copper price. Meanwhile, unforeseen events like worker strikes, earthquakes, bad weather and geopolitical instability can force copper prices upwards,&rdquo; added Hartek Group&rsquo;s Singh.He added that fluctuating copper prices have a profound impact on EPC projects within the energy sector, and this volatility poses significant challenges. &ldquo;As copper prices rise, the cost of these critical components increases, leading to higher overall project costs. The primary consequence of these price fluctuations is the erosion of profit margins,&rdquo; he said.He added that EPC contracts in the private sector and renewable energy projects often operate on fixed pricing agreements, leaving the EPC companies unable to pass on the increased costs to clients.&ldquo;This situation forces us to absorb the additional expenses, which can severely strain our financial resources and impact our ability to maintain competitive pricing,&rdquo; he said.According to Sumit Jhunjhunwala, assistant vice-president and sector head-corporate ratings, ICRA, while the increase in copper prices would lead to an upward pressure on the capital cost for the solar power projects to a certain extent, the developers continue to benefit from the relatively low solar PV module prices.&ldquo;The modules constitute a major component of the capital cost for solar power projects. Over the past 12 months, the solar bid tariffs have remained in the range of Rs 2.5 to Rs 2.7 per unit,&rdquo; he said.On the basis of prevailing module costs and bid tariffs, the project economics remain favourable for the developers and are likely to have the ability to absorb a certain amount of escalation in capital cost, added Jhunjhunwala.According to the latest assessments by the rating agency ICRA, the production of refined copper is likely to be impacted by imminent production cuts from Chinese smelters due to falling margins. Additionally, new sanctions imposed by the US and the UK on Russian metals, including aluminium and copper, are set to intensify supply challenges, adding to the existing bottlenecks in the supply chain of India's renewable energy sector in the near term. This situation raises concerns about sustained cost escalations and potential project delays.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Adani Group plans to invest over USD 1 billion in setting up projects in Sri Lanka to generate electricity from wind in what would be the island nation's single largest foreign direct investment and the biggest ever power project, sources said. Group firm Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL) will set up two wind farms in Sri Lanka's Mannar town and Pooneryn village in the northern provide with a total installed capacity of 484 megawatt at an investment of about USD 740 million.  The related infrastructure that would transmit electricity to consumption centres will see further investment of over USD 290 million, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.  The projects will not just be Sri Lanka's largest renewable energy project but also the nation's biggest power project to date.  Last month, Sri Lanka had entered into an agreement to buy electricity from Adani's wind power stations for 20 years.  AGEL will be paid 8.26 cents per kilowatt-hours (kWh) as per the agreement. This is lower than up to 26.99 cents per kWh paid to thermal projects of state-owned CEB and 9.67 to 13.99 cents per kWh for wind projects. It is lower than 8.75 cents per kWh paid for Odamawadi solar project.  Adani Group is also involved in building a USD 700 million terminal project at the island nation's largest port in Colombo.  Sri Lanka, which suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages during an economic crisis in 2022, has enacted a new legislation to revamp the country's power sector and attract investment in renewable energy.  The move, which is in line with the commitments made under a USD 2.9 billion aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), seeks to reduce losses in the state-run power company Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and make the sector more appealing to investors.  Adani's project is also strategically important as it would restrict China's economic influence in the Indian Ocean, particularly Sri Laka's northern region, which is very close to India's southern mainland.  Sources said there has been talks at the government-to-government level between the two nations, and many other Indian firms, including state-owned, are also planning to set shop there.  There are also talks of setting up a Sri Lanka-India power transmission line for energy trade between the nations.  Sources said Adani's project has received Sri Lankan cabinet approval and a power purchase agreement (PPA) is being finalised, post which the Indian giant will begin work and deliver the project in 2 years.  While Sri Lankan government has negotiated an extremely competitive tariff of 8.25 cents per unit, which is much lower than the existing renewable and traditional energy tariffs, an anti-India lobby, which is said to be backed by China and fossil fuel suppliers, has begun a campaign against Adani.  The lobby groups are raising questions about the environment, due process not being followed, and tariffs.  While environmentally, the project was greenlit post a comprehensive EIA (Environment Impact Assessment) study done by an independent third-party expert, Adani has complied with all existing laws in letter and spirit, they said.  Sri Lanka's Electricity Act allows proposal under G2G mechanism and Adani's project falls under this.  The project was awarded to Adani following age-old process of government floating an RFP (request for proposal) and developers responding to it.  As per procurement guidelines, any tender needs to go through the same process of technical evaluation by Project Committee of CEB and thereafter tariff negotiation by Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee (CANC).  This was followed for Adani's project, they added.  The project has also been approved by the regulator Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).  Adani's tariff is lower than government's own wind power plant and the country's fossil fuel-based power.  The project will contribute to Sri Lanka's energy security, generate clean, renewable energy to the tune of 1,500 million units per annum, meeting energy demand of about 0.6 million households. It will generate 1200+ local employment opportunities, displace fossil fuel worth USD 270 million annually and cut CO2 emission by 1.06 million tonne a year.  Sri Lanka is fuel importer and is currently facing economic crisis. Hence the project will not only pump FDI into the nation, also cut fossil fuel import bill, sources said.",

The company, which also manufactures electrical charging systems, aims to supply an integrated renewable energy generation ecosystem as well as electric charging solutions in India.  \"We want to help communities, especially those in remote regions, with mobile and portable power systems,\" Ram said at the sidelines of the 2024 Clean Economy Investor Forum, organised under the auspices of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) here June 5-6.  Once remotely located communities get access to power, they would be able to connect to networks covering health and education, and other services, he added.  According to Ram, ZekiTek has already identified a potential investor in Gujarat. Once regulatory approvals and certifications are obtained, ZekiTek will start raising funds and shift its manufacturing facility from Brisbane to India.  The ZekiTek CEO sees huge potential for green and clean energy in India.  ZekiTek's ZekiGen system taps solar and wind energy to generate electricity and offers direct connections without requiring high investments in the distribution network, Ram explained.  ZekiGen systems are designed to operate 24 hours a day, generating and storing power through an in-built vertical wind turbine and solar panels, he said, adding that the system is also designed to tap wind energy created by fast-moving vehicular traffic in urban areas.  Besides, Ram said, the company is studying the potential of supplying DC (direct current) systems of 2 Kwh for two- and three-wheeler electric vehicles as well as replacing diesel-powered generators.  At present, ZekiTek is undertaking a pilot project in Fiji in partnership with the Australian government's Market Development Facility.",

EV companies would be responsible for managing these installations.Researchers at IIT-Jodhpur have unveiled a novel adaptor that allows electric vehicles to be charged using solar power. In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his vision for a system where electric vehicles could be powered by energy from rooftop solar systems.Nishant Kumar, an Assistant Professor at the Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Jodhpur, revealed that the adaptor is expected to cost under INR 1,000. Kumar emphasized, \"This could be particularly effective if the solar panel initiative succeeds.\"Kumar also highlighted the growing interest in electric vehicles (EVs), noting that government subsidies are currently in place to encourage their purchase.\"Our charging adaptor will connect to the solar panel on one side and to the company's charger on the other,\" Kumar explained. \"It includes two points that will supply power according to the requirement.\"Kumar mentioned that one significant challenge is extracting maximum power from a solar panel without a power converter, making a charging adaptor essential. He pointed out, \"The charger provided by the company cannot draw power from a solar panel and operate it.\"Addressing this issue is a global endeavor, Kumar added, with several countries, including India, actively seeking solutions. He said that setting up widespread charging infrastructure over the next five years would be formidable.\"Countries such as the US, Canada, China, Russia, India, and Australia are planning to install rooftop solar panels,\" Kumar stated.Kumar outlined a planned setup where a solar panel is mounted on a pole, equipped with a solar socket. EV companies would be responsible for managing these installations.Concerns about the scarcity of charging stations and resources for EVs persist among potential buyers. Kumar highlighted how battery depletion during travel, particularly in hilly and remote areas, exacerbates the problem.\"The adaptor will work with all types of vehicles, and a prototype has been created and tested successfully,\" Kumar confirmed. He added that the product would soon be available in the market.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India will face a significant increase in demand for critical minerals necessary to support its clean energy transition, according to a new study by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP). The report, titled \"Projecting Critical Mineral Needs for India's Clean Energy Transition,\" and has been authored by CSEP Senior Fellow Rajesh Chadha and Associate Fellow Ganesh Sivamani, outlines the mineral requirements for solar panels, wind turbines, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) as India aims to meet its climate action commitments.The study indicates that India's domestic supply of bulk minerals like iron ore, limestone, and bauxite is adequate. However, the country will need to import substantial quantities of non-bulk critical minerals, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite, which are vital for manufacturing clean energy devices and electric vehicle (EV) batteries.Rajesh Chadha said, &ldquo;There are several challenges in achieving India&rsquo;s net zero emissions targets by 2070, including mobilising adequate investments, solving technical and operational challenges, and creating a just transition framework. Another imminent concern is ensuring resilient access to the requisite green technologies and the raw materials needed for their manufacturing, referred to as &lsquo;critical minerals.&rsquo;&rdquo;For the fiscal year 2025, India will need approximately 58 tonnes of lithium, 17 tonnes of cobalt, 52 tonnes of nickel, and 609 tonnes of graphite. By 2047, these requirements are projected to surge, with lithium demand reaching 20,845 tonnes, cobalt at 5,914 tonnes, nickel at 18,599 tonnes, and graphite at 217,884 tonnes.Ganesh Sivamani said, &ldquo;The demand for minerals in the clean energy transition will rise manifold over the coming decades. Most of these have been identified as critical by an earlier CSEP study and the Ministry of Mines report on Critical Minerals for India. For these minerals, especially those with no known domestic resources, mineral-wise strategies are required to ensure robust access for India&rsquo;s manufacturing needs and climate change mitigation ambitions.&rdquo;Recycling is identified as a key strategy to reduce dependency on virgin ores. Improved recycling rates could save around 1,500 kilotonne of critical metals over the next two decades. For solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies, extending the lifespan of projects from 20 to 25 years could reduce mineral demand by up to 30% by 2047.The research highlights the cases in which India has access to these minerals domestically and the reliance on imported minerals (in either their raw, processed, or component-embedded forms) to meet the needs of the growing domestic clean energy equipment manufacturing sector. The results of the projections exercise can help policymakers devise strategies for secure supply chains of the minerals required for the clean technology transition.The report stresses the need for resilient strategies to secure the supply of critical minerals as India commits to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, a goal presented at COP26 in Glasgow. The government is urged to explore domestic extraction and processing of these minerals and consider international cooperation for resource acquisition and technology sharing.The study concluded that technological advancements and policy changes necessitate periodic updates to these projections. Ensuring a stable supply of critical minerals will be crucial for India's clean energy transition and broader climate objectives.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a significant move to bolster clean economy infrastructure, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) has launched the Catalytic Capital Fund, aiming to mobilize up to $3.3 billion in private investment. Announced at the IPEF ministerial meeting held in Singapore, this fund seeks to support the development of sustainable projects across emerging and upper-middle-income economies in the region.The fund was kick-started with initial contributions totaling $33 million from Australia, Japan, Korea, and the United States. These funds are intended to catalyze substantial private sector investment, marking a major step forward in regional efforts to enhance energy security and environmental sustainability.During the meeting, where the Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal represented India, IPEF partners also signed agreements focusing on Clean Economy, Fair Economy, and an overarching agreement on the economic framework designed to address 21st-century economic challenges and enhance regional engagement. Although India participated actively in the discussions and proceedings, it has yet to sign the agreements, pending the completion of domestic approval processes which are expected to conclude after the formation of the new government.These agreements are set to become effective after at least five IPEF partners complete their internal legal procedures for ratification, acceptance, or approval. The Clean Economy Agreement is particularly notable for its commitment to accelerating energy security and transition, enhancing climate resilience, and promoting technical cooperation and capacity building, all of which are areas where the new Catalytic Capital Fund will play a significant role.Barthwal highlighted India's substantial contributions to the development of cooperative bodies under the agreements and reiterated India's goals to become a major player in the global supply chain, leveraging its skilled manpower, natural resources, and supportive policies.A significant initiative introduced at the meeting was the Cooperative Work Programme on \"e-waste urban mining,\" led by India. This program aims to create a more sustainable e-waste management system through the exchange of current and emerging technologies, techniques, and activities for efficient recovery and recycling of materials, especially critical metals and minerals.The forum also reviewed the progress of the IPEF Upskilling Initiative, which has provided 10.9 million upskilling opportunities primarily for women and girls in the IPEF partner countries over the past two years, with India receiving four million of these opportunities.Looking forward, the ministerial meeting set the schedule for the first meeting of the three Supply Chain institutional committees to be held virtually in July 2024 and in person in Washington DC later that year. The next IPEF ministerial meeting is planned to be virtual in September 2024, with preparations for the first meeting of the IPEF Council and the Joint Commission set for 2025.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: As many as 69 sustainable infrastructure projects worth over USD 23 billion of investment opportunities were identified at the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) clean economy investor forum meet in Singapore, according to a statement. The statement of Singapore's ministry of trade and economy, which hosted the meet, out of the 69 projects, 20 investment-ready projects worth about USD 6 billion were presented to investors at business matching sessions.  Remaining projects worth about USD 17 billion were also identified as potential investment opportunities in future.  The forum brought together about 300 participants from the Indo-Pacific region's top investors, cutting-edge project proponents, innovative start-up entrepreneurs, ministers and senior government officials.  The Indian delegation was led by Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal.  Organised by Singapore's ministry alongside the 13 other IPEF partners, the forum aims to facilitate high-quality business and capital matching and build connections between the public and private sectors through insightful conversations with expert panelists.  It is a key initiative to advance the objectives of the IPEF Clean Economy Agreement, by mobilising financing in support of the development and deployment of clean energy and climate-friendly infrastructure and technologies in the IPEF economies.  The 14-member IPEF (Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity) bloc was launched jointly by the US and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23, 2022, in Tokyo. Together, they account for 40 per cent of the world's economic output and 28 per cent of trade.  The framework is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy. India has joined all the pillars except the trade.  Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam are members of the bloc.  \"A total of 69 sustainable infrastructure projects amounting to over USD 23 billion of investment opportunities were identified at the Investor Forum,\" the statement said.  All IPEF partners were invited to nominate sustainable infrastructure projects through a process facilitated by PwC Singapore.  The 20 investment-ready projects are in diverse areas including industrial parks, special economic zones, energy, agriculture and aquaculture, waste management, water and transport sectors, and were nominated by Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.  It added that the 14 countries announced new funding and projects at the forum to pursue investments in the clean economy.  Australia, Japan, Korea and the US announced the operational launch of an IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund, which is pooling resources to expand the pipeline of bankable clean economy infrastructure projects.  \"Japan will launch the Hydrogen Fund which aims to leverage private financing in strengthening cross-border hydrogen supply chains,\" it said adding the fund will also establish an \"IPEF window\" to deploy funding for activities undertaken in the region.  It is scheduled to start operations by the third quarter of this year.  DFC's (Development Finance Corporation) Board has also approved an equity investment as part of the USD 900 million Eversource Climate Investment Partners-II fund, which will provide capital, management, and expertise to innovative companies using new and existing capabilities to address climate change in India and Southeast Asia.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India offers huge investment opportunities worth over USD 500 billion, particularly in clean energy value chain including renewables, green hydrogen and EV, by 2030, the commerce ministry said on Thursday. This was stated by Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal, who is in Singapore for the two-day meet of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Clean Economy Investor Forum.  The meeting, which started on Wednesday, brought together the region's top investors, clean economy companies, and start-ups to mobilise investments into sustainable infrastructure, climate technology, and renewable energy projects.  The 14-member IPEF bloc was launched jointly by the US and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23, 2022, in Tokyo. Together, they account for 40 per cent of the world's economic output and 28 per cent of trade.

Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam are members of the bloc.  Barthwal, during the inaugural IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum, acknowledged the forum as a unique platform that brought global investors, policy makers, and academia under one roof, which would be instrumental in advancing sustainable infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific Region.  The secretary while addressing the forum underlined the huge investment opportunities that \"India offers of more than USD 500 billion, particularly in the clean energy value chain including renewables, green hydrogen and EV and its infrastructure transition, by 2030\".  Barthwal also highlighted key reforms around ease of doing business in India to improve business environment over the last decade.  During the two-day event, more than 300 participants from financial institutions, multilateral development banks, venture capital funds, project owners, entrepreneurs and government agencies from IPEF partners actively participated under the sustainable infrastructure and climate tech engagement tracks.  In the sustainable infrastructure track, after the screening, \"four companies (ReNew Power, Avaada Energy Pvt Ltd, Indusbridge Capital Advisors LLP. Founder, SEIP, and Powerica Ltd) from India were shortlisted for pitching their concepts on energy transition, transport and logistics, and waste management/waste to energy to global investors,\" the ministry said.  Similarly in the climate tech track, 10 Indian startups and companies (BluSmart, Recykal, LOHUM, Sea6 Energy, EVage Ventures, Kabira Mobility, Batx Energies, Newtrace and Alt Mobility, igrenEnergi, Inc.) were selected to pitch their innovative ideas, technologies and solutions that contribute to mitigating or adapting to climate change.  Further, the ministry said that the forum resulted in USD 23 billion investment opportunities for sustainable infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific.  The coalition estimates that its members, taken together, have over USD 25 billion in capital that can be deployed in Indo-Pacific emerging market infrastructure investments in the coming years.  DFC's (Development Finance Corporation) Board has also approved an equity investment as part of the USD 900 million Eversource Climate Investment Partners-II fund, which will provide capital, management, and expertise to innovative companies using new and existing capabilities to address climate change in India and Southeast Asia.  It added that the IPEF partners and the Private Infrastructure Development Group announced the operational launch of the IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund, which would deploy concessional financing, technical assistance, and capacity-building support to expand the pipeline of quality, resilient, and inclusive clean economy infrastructure projects in emerging and upper-middle income economies, for instance, projects in development include a renewable energy platform in India.  The fund's founding supporters include Australia, Japan, Korea, and the US, which plan to provide USD 33 million in initial grant to catalyse up to USD 3.3 billion in private investment.  \"A coalition of investors, including Singapore's Temasek and GIC, have committed to injecting USD 25 billion in infrastructure investments in emerging markets that are part of an economic alliance between the US and several Asia-Pacific countries,\" it added.  The event also witnessed signing of an offtake agreement between Sembcorp Green Hydrogen India, Kyushu Electric and Sojitz for production and export of 200 KTPA (kilotonne per annum) green ammonia from India to Japan.  The programme was attended by ministers from Singapore and Japan and Barthwal.  The agreement aims to increase production and export of 200 KTPA green ammonia in Phase-I (total 800 KTPA in 4 phases) at Tuticorin Port in India and export to Japan.  The project proposed above would further the objective of the National Green Hydrogen Mission implemented by India towards making the country as global hub for production and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives.  During an interaction with Indian companies and startups, Additional Secretary in the Department of Commerce and India's Chief Negotiator for IPEF Rajesh Agrawal said the forum provides an opportunity for Indian companies and startups to seek funding and collaborate with global investors.",

Sembcorp Green Hydrogen Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore's Sembcorp Industries has signed a Heads of Terms (HoT) with buyers Sojitz Corporation and Kyushu Electric Power Co Inc of Japan, paving the way to finalise a definitive green ammonia offtake agreement.  Work towards a front-end engineering design award for the project in India is underway following the completion of the feasibility study. Land for the facility in India has been secured, said Sembcorp.  As the lead developer and operator of the project, Sembcorp will utilise renewable energy to produce an initial 200,000 metric tonnes per annum of green ammonia from the Indian plant.  The HoT was presented at the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Clean Economy Investor Forum, and witnessed by Ken Saito, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan; Dr Tan See Leng, Second Minister for Trade and Industry, Singapore; and Sunil Barthwal, Commerce Secretary, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India.  The project brings together three IPEF members - Japan, Singapore and India, in a cross-border collaboration to accelerate the development of a low-carbon supply chain and advance the region's transition to a clean economy. It also demonstrates Sembcorp's commitment to drive energy transition, while leveraging its expertise and proven track record in India, where it has a gross renewables portfolio of 4.7GW.  A memorandum of understanding was signed by the three companies, as a consortium, on December 18, 2023, to explore supplying Japan with green ammonia produced in India.",

            "articleBody": "A two-year US tariff holiday on solar panels from Southeast Asia expires on Thursday, starting the clock ticking for American project developers to use the huge amount of equipment they stockpiled duty-free over that period by the end of this year. The dynamic could result in a mini-boom in already red-hot US solar installations, while also annoying the nascent domestic manufacturing industry which is keen to see developers make the switch to American-made gear. US solar developers accumulated around 35 gigawatts (GW) of imported panels in US warehouses since President Joe Biden lifted the duties on Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in 2022 to help speed domestic projects to fight climate change, according to energy advisory firm Clean Energy Associates. That is nearly as much solar capacity as the US will install during all of 2024, according to research firm Wood Mackenzie. The vast majority of the inventory is believed to have come from the targeted countries, and once the tariffs snap back into place on June 6, companies will have just 180 days to use that Southeast Asian stock or they will need to pay up. Companies have already dramatically increased project building, with utility-scale installations soaring 135% to 9.8 GW in the first quarter, according to Wood Mackenzie. \"The temporary tariff moratorium did its job to ensure a sufficient supply of solar modules to support the need for increased clean energy deployment,\" said Stacy Ettinger, senior vice president of supply chain and trade for the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. An attorney for US solar manufacturers who are seeking new tariffs on Southeast Asian imports said it was unrealistic to expect all the inventory to be used in the next six months. \"The tariff moratorium led to this surge and glut of inventories that we're seeing today, that has also contributed to the 50% price collapse in the market that is harming the US industry,\" Tim Brightbill, a trade attorney with Wiley Rein, said, referring to domestic manufacturers of panels. The glut of panels marks an about-face for the US industry, which until a year ago was struggling with tight supplies due to the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about solar equipment linked to forced labor, among other constraints. Solar imports surged since the beginning of 2023 and were up nearly 14% in the first quarter this year - with 88% of that from the targeted countries, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. The tariffs are meant to target imports by companies found to be dodging US duties on Chinese goods by finishing panels in the four Southeast Asian nations. The White House said last month that it would vigorously enforce the 180-day deadline to prevent stockpiling. SEIA did not address the deadline in its statement to Reuters. SEIA had lobbied against the circumvention tariffs, saying they would drive up project costs and threaten the nation's ability to address climate change. It did not lobby for an extension of the tariff holiday. ",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a significant shift towards sustainable energy, global investment in clean energy is poised to double that of fossil fuels in 2024, reaching nearly $2 trillion, according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) annual World Energy Investment report. The total global energy investment is expected to exceed $3 trillion for the first time next year, with clean technologies such as renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, and storage drawing the majority of the funds.The report marks a milestone as investments in renewable power and grid technologies had surpassed those in fossil fuels for the first time in 2023. The remainder of the investment, slightly over $1 trillion, will continue to flow into traditional energy sources like coal, gas, and oil.IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol highlighted the enduring appeal of clean energy, stating, \"Clean energy investment is setting new records even in challenging economic conditions, highlighting the momentum behind the new global energy economy. For every dollar going to fossil fuels today, almost two dollars are invested in clean energy.\"Despite the optimistic global outlook, the IEA report identified significant disparities, particularly in emerging and developing economies outside China. These regions are expected to see clean energy spending exceed $300 billion for the first time, led by nations such as India and Brazil. However, this investment still represents only about 15% of the global total, which is below what is needed to meet rising energy demands in these countries, where high capital costs impede new projects.China dominates the clean energy investment landscape, projected to invest approximately $675 billion in 2024. This investment is driven by strong domestic demand in key industries including solar, lithium batteries, and electric vehicles. Following China, Europe and the United States are expected to invest $370 billion and $315 billion respectively, collectively accounting for more than two-thirds of the global investment in clean energy.The report also underscores a significant increase in solar PV investment, set to reach $500 billion in 2024, as falling module prices stimulate new projects, making it the leading technology transforming the power sector.Additionally, the global upstream oil and gas investment is expected to rise by 7% in 2024, reaching $570 billion, predominantly driven by national oil companies in the Middle East and Asia. Despite this growth, the investment in clean energy by oil and gas companies was only $30 billion in 2023, accounting for a mere 4% of their total capital expenditure.The IEA also noted improvements in grid and battery storage investment, crucial for facilitating the clean energy transition. Investment in grids is anticipated to hit $400 billion in 2024, significantly up from the annual $300 billion recorded between 2015 and 2021. Investment in battery storage is expected to reach $54 billion in 2024, though this spending remains highly concentrated in advanced economies and China.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's power sector is set to witness significant investment flows, driven predominantly by renewable energy and electricity transmission projects, with an estimated $190 billion to $215 billion required for renewable energy capacity by 2030, said Moody&rsquo;s Ratings on Tuesday. An additional investment of $150 billion to $170 billion will be needed for electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure to support this expansion.India targets to achieve 500GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, necessitating an annual capacity addition of about 44GW. \"Power sector investments will be driven by renewable energy and transmission projects,\" said Moody&rsquo;s, emphasizing the vast capital required to meet these ambitious goals.Despite the renewable push, coal will not be sidelined and is expected to play a crucial role in meeting baseload power needs. According to Moody&rsquo;s, India is likely to add between 40GW and 50GW of coal-based capacity over the next five to six years to meet an expected annual power demand growth of 5%-6%. \"The utilization rate for coal-based capacity is likely to remain high at around 65%-70% despite these additions,\" Moody&rsquo;s noted.However, the substantial investment in renewables could lead to increased financial leverage for companies in this sector, primarily due to debt financing. \"The significant increase in capital spending for renewable energy companies, which is largely funded by debt, will lead to high financial leverage over the next three years, a credit negative,\" Moody&rsquo;s explained. In contrast, leverage for government-related issuers is expected to remain moderate.On the regulatory front, Moody&rsquo;s commended the stable regulatory environment and policy support in India, which have substantially increased the share of renewable energy in the country's power capacity mix to about 43% in fiscal 2023-2024. \"Stable regulations and policy framework will support power companies implementing carbon transition,\" Moody's reported. The clarity provided by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission&rsquo;s tariff regulations for 2024-2029 has been crucial for regulated power companies in terms of returns and cost pass-through mechanisms, aiding in the transition towards cleaner energy while maintaining profitability.These efforts are part of India's broader strategy to achieve its 2030 energy transition targets and the 2070 net-zero goal.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: ReNew Energy Global Plc on Thursday said its net profit jumped seven-fold to USD 7 million in the January-March quarter of FY24 due to higher income and reduced expenses. The total revenue for the latest fourth quarter decreased by 4.4 per cent to USD 297 million, down from USD 311 million in the same period in the preceding fiscal, according to a company statement.  The company attributed the fall in revenue to lower earnings from its transmission projects.  The company's net profit for the entire financial year stood at USD 50 million, compared to a net loss of USD 60 million in FY23.  The clean energy major registered an 8.1 per cent jump in its total revenue to USD 1,158 million in FY24 from USD 1,072 million in FY23.  The company said that the record profits were registered despite a marginal fall in the weighted average Plant Load Factor (PLF) for the reporting quarter as well as the financial year due to lower radiation and wind speeds.  While the PLF for FY24 was 26.4 per cent for wind assets, compared to 25.5 per cent for FY23, the PLF for solar assets for FY24 was 24.6 per cent compared to 24.8 per cent for FY23.  With a committed portfolio of 21 GW, the company said it expects to add a capacity of 1,900-2,400 MWs by the end of FY25 and around 16 GW by the end of FY27 after capital recycling.  \"These positive earnings will further fuel our ambitious growth plans of doubling our capacity to over 20 GW in the next five years with a continued focus on execution, and will allow us to lead the trebling of India's renewable energy capacity,\" ReNew's Chairman and CEO Sumant Sinha said.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The DMRC headquarters, Metro Bhawan, in central Delhi received carbon neutral certification on the World Environment Day, a statement said on Wednesday. This milestone follows the earlier certification of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation's staff quarters in Nodia sector-50 as carbon neutral. Metro Bhawan received this certification from Earthood, a world's leading validation and verification company in the carbon market. The Gurugram-based company operates from India, UK, Turkey, UAE and Lat America. According to the statement, it is a significant step in the organisation's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and combating climate change. In line with the government's target to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, the DMRC continues to work for carbon neutrality by adopting and implementing advanced environmental practices, it stated. The certification of Metro Bhawan as carbon neutral for the fiscal year 2023-24 under the Public Accountability Standard (PAS) 2060 is a testament to these efforts, the statement added. \"The DMRC has effectively reduced all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated from Metro Bhawan through various innovative and eco-friendly initiatives. These include the installation of rainwater harvesting (RWH) pits, a sewage treatment plant (STP), the use of treated effluent for horticulture, water-efficient fixtures, and an organic waste converter. These measures have significantly reduced the office's environmental footprint,\" the DMRC said in the statement. In addition, Metro Bhawan has implemented numerous energy-efficient measures, such as installing energy-efficient equipment, a rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) plant and energy metering systems, it said. These initiatives have drastically cut down CO2 emissions from the building's energy consumption. Metro Bhawan has also secured a gold rating from the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), it said. According to the statement, a target has been set to achieve a five per cent reduction in overall energy consumption in the next year, aiming to further decrease the energy intensity of Metro Bhawan. DMRC is the first metro in the world to register for carbon credits with the United Nations body. This recent certification is another milestone in its ongoing journey towards environmental sustainability and operational excellence, the statement said.",

            "articleBody": "Saint-Imier: Switzerland's largest wind farm, sitting astride the ridge of the Jura mountains by the French border, consists of only 16 turbines -- tiny compared to those of other European countries.The wealthy Alpine country has said it wants to rapidly accelerate the development of renewable energy sources as it strives to meet its target of carbon neutrality by 2050.Authorities want to use a new climate bill approved last year to boost wind and solar power's current miniscule contribution to Switzerland's energy mix.But that plan could hit a snag: the bill is being challenged by a national referendum on Sunday, potentially blocking its implementation next January.While most environmental organisations back the law and its ambitions, a few smaller groups secured enough signatures to trigger a referendum under Switzerland's direct democracy system, amid fears it will fast-track large-scale energy projects and cause \"unnecessary destruction of landscapes\".Switzerland's largest party, the hard right Swiss People's Party (SVP), has also backed the vote, warning that implementing the law could threaten Swiss energy security.\"It is not with renewable energy produced on mountaintops in the Jura that we will manage to guarantee supply security,\" Yvan Pahud, an SVP parliamentarian, told AFP.The SVP supports more nuclear power instead.- Sacrificing nature? -Pierre-Alain Bruchez, who instigated the referendum, balked at the idea of installing large numbers of solar panels high up in pristine mountain landscapes. The retired economist said he launched his battle after learning with \"horror\" of the Grengiols-Solar project, aimed at installing around 230,000 solar panels in the mountainous Wallis canton, at an altitude of 2,500 metres.\"We must not sacrifice nature on the altar of climate change,\" he told AFP.Vera Weber, president of the Franz Weber Foundation for Nature and Animal Protection, which also called for the referendum, agreed.\"This law weakens the protection of nature in Switzerland,\" she told AFP.Despite such arguments, overturning the law could prove difficult.Sunday's vote will take place less than two months after Switzerland became the first country ever to be condemned by an international court for not doing enough against climate change.The verdict by the European Court of Human Rights appears to have jolted the Swiss public, with 73 percent of voters polled recently saying they backed the law.- More positives than negatives -The bill is aimed at rapidly increasing hydro, wind and solar production, and it clears the way for a simplified approval process for large-scale projects.As for solar power, the main aim would be to install panels on building roofs and facades.The Swiss government, which supports the law, has acknowledged that court appeals against renewable energy projects \"will probably be less likely to succeed than before\".However, it stresses that large installations in \"biotopes of national importance\" and in migratory bird reserves will remain banned, albeit with some exceptions.WWF, which is among several environmental groups that support the law, highlighted that the bill calls for \"over 80 percent of planned renewable energy development to go through solar on existing buildings\".WWF expert Patrick Hofstetter added that \"effective measures against electricity waste are finally being introduced\".\"From our point of view, the benefits of the project clearly outweigh\" the negatives, he said.- Overcoming fossil fuel dependence -Greenpeace's Swiss chapter said the law could help Switzerland \"overcome its dependence on fossil fuels like oil and gas, which often come from bellicose states\".Jaqueline de Quattro, a parliamentarian with the Liberal party, agreed.Switzerland, she pointed out, spends eight billion Swiss francs ($8.9 billion) a year \"on undemocratic fossil imports like Russian gas, or oil from Arab countries\".Given how reliant the Swiss are on the comforts energy brings, she told AFP, \"we must also accept from time to time to see a wind turbine on the horizon\".",

            "articleBody": "China&rsquo;s export boom goes far beyond the high-tech industries that are in Western crosshairs, leaving Beijing at risk of a backlash from countries that have so far preferred to sit on the trade-war sidelines. The European Union is poised to slap tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles this week, the latest example of rising barriers to global trade. The US already made a similar move, and Canada may follow suit. Few other nations have raised that particular concern, since most don&rsquo;t have their own EV industries to protect.But China&rsquo;s surplus in manufacturing trade, which is close to record levels, points to a much broader surge in exports. It encompasses not just green-energy goods but all kinds of products &mdash; from steel to animal feed &mdash; that are getting harder to sell at home, where a real estate slump is slowing the economy.    In many cases rising exports have been accompanied by falling prices. If that combination persists, it threatens to trigger reactions from more countries beyond the US and Europe.China&rsquo;s trade partners worry that overcapacity in areas tied to housing &ldquo;will lead to the dumping of some of these materials in overseas markets,&rdquo; said Ong Kian Ming, Malaysia&rsquo;s former deputy minister for international trade.There are already the beginnings of a backlash, with record numbers of anti-subsidy and anti-dumping measures against Chinese goods last year. Most of the former happened in Group of Seven developed countries. But the anti-dumping efforts came from a wide variety of nations such as India and South Korea, and targeted a range of manufactured goods including steel products, wheel loaders and wind towers, according to the World Trade Organization.    China&rsquo;s iron and steel exports hit a record 13 million tons in March and stayed near that level in April, according to Bloomberg analysis of the official data, as domestic demand slumped due to the collapse in housing construction. Local firms are on track to produce a billion tons of steel again this year, and with no sign of a housing rebound they&rsquo;ll likely try to export more excess metal.Prices have been plunging for almost three years, leading some Latin American nations to impose tariffs to stem the tide and protect local producers. Those barriers, along with increased US tariffs due to go into effect in August, may lead to even more metal being directed to Asia.    Companies in Vietnam and India are already complaining about the flood of cheap metal, which hit the profits of firms like Tata Steel Ltd, one of India&rsquo;s leading producers. Thailand and Saudi Arabia are considering new levies.The slowing domestic economy isn&rsquo;t just driving down demand and prices for metals. China&rsquo;s exports of soybean meal jumped to almost 600,000 tons in the first four months of 2024, nearly five times the year-earlier level. The meal is used to feed animals, but less demand for pork means fewer pigs, and that&rsquo;s pushed Chinese processors to export their surplus.Another area where China has seen a manufacturing surge is petrochemicals. A wave of new plants is producing the building blocks of plastic products from water bottles to football helmets &ndash; and the boom isn&rsquo;t over yet. China is expected this year to bring online enough propane dehydrogenation plants to boost its overall capacity by 40%, according to researcher Mysteel OilChem.That&rsquo;s proving disruptive for chemical industries in neighboring countries such as South Korea and Japan. China is now importing more raw feedstocks like crude oil and propane, and less semi-refined petrochemical products. The hit to sales at rival plants has forced the closure of at least one facility in South Korea.    Of course, there are still plenty of nations where cheaper Chinese goods are welcome. Imported solar panels have helped South Africa deal with crippling power shortages. Demand for the panels has also soared in India, even though it doesn&rsquo;t have great relations with China, after the government in Delhi eased a ban last year.What&rsquo;s more, tariffs aren&rsquo;t always designed to keep China out &ndash; in some cases it&rsquo;s almost the opposite. Both Brazil and Turkey have raised barriers to direct imports of EVs, but accompanied those measures with efforts to attract Chinese firms and get them to build EV factories in the countries. One policymaker in Beijing is pushing for further moves in that direction. People&rsquo;s Bank of China adviser Huang Yiping recently called for China to implement a version of the Marshall Plan, a US foreign-aid initiative after World War II. He said China could lend money and provide technology to developing nations so they can build their own renewable energy industries.For now, unresolved tensions remain a threat to global trade, one that could worsen if more countries and industries get pulled into the contest.Speaking in Beijing last week, Gita Gopinath &ndash; deputy chief of the International Monetary Fund &ndash; warned that trade decoupling and the formation of rival blocs could lop as much as 7% off global economic output in the medium term. &ldquo;The point that we have been making strongly is that policies that exacerbate fragmentation are just negative for the whole world,&rdquo; she said.",

            "articleBody": "Paris: More money is pouring into solar power than all other electricity sources combined, with investments set to reach half a trillion dollars this year, the world's top energy research body said Thursday.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast in a report that global investment in clean energy this year will hit $2 trillion, twice the amount going to fossil fuels.It said combined investment in renewable power and grids overtook the amount spent on fossil fuels for the first time in 2023.\"Clean energy investment is setting new records even in challenging economic conditions, highlighting the momentum behind the new global energy economy,\" IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement accompanying the agency's annual World Energy Investment report.Companies and governments worldwide are raising spending on clean energy production to reduce the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels that are driving deadly climate change. The report said improving supply chains and lower costs were driving up investment in forms of so-called clean energy, which include solar panels, wind turbines, electric cars and heat pumps, as well as nuclear power generation.Combined investment in renewables and nuclear for electricity generation is now set to reach 10 times the amount going to fossil-fuel power, led by solar, with China investing the biggest share.\"More money is now going into solar PV (photovoltaic panels) than all other electricity generation technologies combined,\" the report said.Solar panel costs have decreased by 30 percent over the past two years and in 2024 \"investment in solar PV is set to grow to $500 billion as falling module prices spur new investments.\"By comparison, global upstream oil and gas investment is expected to increase by seven percent in 2024 to reach $570 billion, following a similar rise in 2023.The IEA warned however of \"major imbalances and shortfalls in energy investment flows in many parts of the world\" where clean energy projects remain prohibitively expensive.Excluding renewable energy giant China, the $300 billion invested by emerging and developing economies remained \"far below what is required to meet growing energy demand in many of these countries\".\"More must be done to ensure that investment reaches the places where it is needed most,\" Birol said. The IEA said that meeting medium-term global goals to reduce harmful carbon emissions would require investment in renewable power to be doubled worldwide by 2030.",

            "articleBody": "India has already commenced a silent revolution - powered not by fossil fuels, but by solar and renewables. Even as the world grapples with the urgent need to combat climate change, India has achieved a remarkable feat in its renewable energy journey, surpassing its ambitious target of 175 GW by 2022, well ahead of schedule. As of March 2024, India's installed solar energy capacity stands at 81.81 GW, representing 63.4% of total renewable energy generation. From wind-swept plains to solar-drenched landscapes, the nation is harnessing the power of nature to drive a new era of growth, one that promises not just financial returns, but also a legacy of planetary preservation. India's journey to a future completely powered by renewable energy may take some time. To accelerate its speed, the four fundamental pillars would be cleantech innovation, renewable energy empowerment, sustainable environmental impact, and economic benefits to all. URGENCY FOR CLEAN ENERGY IN INDIAIndia&rsquo;s energy needs have surged in tandem with its economic growth. Currently, India ranks third globally in terms of energy consumption, with an annual growth rate of approximately 5%. Fossil fuels, particularly coal, still dominates the energy mix, accounting for over 70% of electricity generation. However, this reliance exacts a toll on the environment, with India ranking among the world's top greenhouse gas emitters.The environmental challenges are hence daunting. Air pollution, a dire consequence of fossil fuel combustion, leads to over a million premature deaths annually. According to a recent report, the world&rsquo;s 100 worst polluted cities are in Asia and 83 of them are in India. Moreover, climate change threatens India's agriculture, water resources, and coastal communities. Rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns have imperilled food security and exacerbated natural disasters. These challenges showcase the need for India to embrace a transformative change. Renewable energy provides a pathway to mitigate emissions and drive sustainable development and hence the urgency for clean energy in India is not just an environmental imperative but also an economic necessity. ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF CLEAN ENERGY LEADERSHIPIndia's pivot towards clean energy not only champions environmental sustainability but also unlocks several economic opportunities. Additionally, advancements in energy storage solutions like solar batteries, or Green Hydrogen Fuel Cells, will ensure consistent power supply even during low renewable energy production, maximizing economic benefits. India's focus on Green Hydrogen production using renewable energy can position the country as a future leader in this clean fuel source, creating a lucrative export industry. The major benefit in India's tectonic pivot is the ability to bring down the unit cost of fuel, reducing reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports. This fuel revolution also spurs a wave of new green jobs across a spectrum of roles. From manufacturing solar panels to installation and maintenance of hydrogen fuel cells, these jobs could inject much-needed vitality into local economies across the nation.Besides fuel and ability to infuse jobs, renewable sources like solar power reduce dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports. More importantly, energy storage solutions like batteries allow for using renewable energy even during low production times, maximizing its economic benefit. The transition to renewable energy heralds a paradigm shift in energy economics. There has been a significant rise in economic attractiveness of new solar power projects owing to the plummeting cost of solar cells and modules to 65% and 50%, respectively, in the recent past. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) forecasted that India could catalyse $200-300 billion of new investment in renewables in the decade up to 2027. This could mean bolstering energy security and reducing our reliance on volatile global markets.SETTING A RENEWABLE ECOSYSTEMIndia's ambitious renewable energy targets demonstrate its commitment to clean energy. The country has made significant progress, with renewable energy including hydropower sources accounting for nearly 42% of total power generation as of 2023, according to India&rsquo;s power ministry. Government initiatives promoting renewable energy adoption, such as solar rooftop schemes and wind power auctions, incentivise investment and deployment. Public-private partnerships further bolster infrastructure development, facilitating grid integration and energy storage solutions.For a larger adoption rate, however, the ecosystem needs expansion. According to CII, over 6,600 cleantech startups focused on diverse areas ranging from green entrepreneurship, driving innovation across the spectrum. However, challenges remain, particularly in grid integration and energy storage. The intermittent nature of renewable energy necessitates innovative solutions for seamless integration into the grid and efficient storage technologies to ensure round-the-clock availability. In this dynamic ecosystem, the collaboration between government, industry, and academia is essential to surmount these challenges and realise India's renewable energy potential.BUILDING LONG TERM VALUE Despite the several challenges, the government's handholding in the renewables space has been encouraging. Programs like the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's (MNRE) Startup Scheme and funding mechanisms like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Fund support cleantech innovation and entrepreneurship. Incubation centres such as the National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) provide infrastructure and mentorship to budding entrepreneurs.India adopted a pragmatic stance towards renewables and announced production linked incentives for the renewables sector. To boost high efficiency solar PV modules, the government announced a first tranche of PLI benefits estimated at Rs. 4,500 crore. A second tranche of Rs. 19,500 crore was announced subsequently targeting 5 MMT of annual green hydrogen/ammonia production by 2030. In addition to production, India's approach is also important because it also targeted the direct employment of nearly 30,000 people and indirect employment of about 120,000 people. According to government estimates, the PLI incentivization also resulted in import substitution of nearly Rs. 17,500 crore every year besides enabling research for high efficiency in solar PV modules. In terms of battery storage capacity too, the country is expected to witness an upward trajectory owing to government&rsquo;s Viability Gap Funding (VGF) and other favourable policy announcements. Despite the optimism and substantial progress, India requires an estimated investment of $80-100 billion annually to meet its renewable energy targets, as per the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Bridging this financing gap demands innovative financial instruments, risk mitigation mechanisms, and enhanced participation from both the public and private sectors.Furthermore, the shortage of skilled workforce poses a significant impediment to the sector's growth. Investments in skill development and vocational training are imperative to capitalise on this demographic dividend.Streamlining regulations, expediting project approvals, and ensuring consistency in policies are essential for attracting investments and driving innovation. India's ascent as a clean energy vanguard heralds a new era of sustainable economic growth and environmental stewardship. India holds an edge in emerging as the leader of clean energy innovation and deployment. With abundant natural resources, a burgeoning market, and a commitment to sustainability, India stands at the cusp of a transformative journey toward a cleaner, greener future.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: China is expected to install about 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity by the end of 2024, crossing its 2025 green hydrogen production target of 200,000 tonnes per annum (tpa), according to a recent analysis by research firm Rystad Energy. &ldquo;Under its national plan, China is targeting green hydrogen production of 200,000 tpa by the end of 2025 but it would exceed that volume by the end of this year,&rdquo; it said.The research firm added that the 2.5 GW capacity is expected to produce 220,000 tpa of green hydrogen, which is six-kilotonnes-per-annum (ktpa) more than the rest of the world combined. &ldquo;By 2030, China&rsquo;s four largest projects will account for up to half of the country&rsquo;s total green hydrogen production capacity,&rdquo; said the analysis.It added that Mainland China has installed a cumulative one-gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity in 2023. However, a substantial portion of China's hydrogen supply is derived from grey hydrogen, produced through coal gasification or steam methane reforming. &ldquo;If China intends to achieve its dual carbon objectives of peaking emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, switching to low-carbon hydrogen production methods will be crucial,&rdquo; it said.According to Minh Khoi Le, head of hydrogen research, Rystad Energy, while China's proposed standards and solutions represent progress, they currently fall short of the more stringent benchmarks set by European counterparts. &ldquo;The ambiguity surrounding the definitions of 'low carbon' and 'renewable' hydrogen within China's policies is a notable concern. It is imperative for China to adopt clear and stringent definitions that align with global best practices, such as those seen in Europe,&rdquo; Le added.China has significant solar and wind power potential in its north and northwest regions, including Xinjiang, Gansu and Inner Mongolia. The nation&rsquo;s solar PV capacity surged to 217 GW of new installations in 2023, 2.5 times the amount installed in 2022. For wind installations, 76 GW was added in 2023, double that of 2022, the research firm.",

            "articleBody": "TOKYO: Sumitomo Corp aims to install 500 megawatts (MW) or more of battery storage in Japan by March 2031, from 9 MW now, to help mitigate renewable energy fluctuations and improve the efficiency of the energy system, a company official said. As resource-poor Japan expands renewable energy to meet decarbonisation goals and enhance energy security, battery usage is expected to rise to smooth out the intermittent supply of solar and wind energy. Sumitomo's battery storage initiative is part of the Japanese trading house's broader efforts to bolster its energy transformation business. \"We aim to contribute to the stabilisation and decarbonisation of the electricity system by developing and operating large battery storages,\" Shigenobu Hamada, head of Sumitomo's energy storage business unit, told reporters. \"Our goal is to develop a competitive battery storage business by leveraging our proprietary operational systems,\" he said on Wednesday, adding that Sumitomo is also looking to invest in the business abroad. Sumitomo expects Japan's local battery storage capacity to grow from 2 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2023 to 40 GWh by 2030, while global capacity is anticipated to expand from 190 GWh to 2,206 GWh. Battery storage is expanding rapidly worldwide, led by China and the United States, but Japan lags due to smaller price differences in the wholesale electricity market, making it hard for storage developers to generate profits, Sumitomo said. But the Japanese market will likely take off on the back of government support and institutional changes such as the development of a market for adjusting electricity supply and demand, the company said. Sumitomo has so far installed three energy storage facilities, including 6 MW at Chitose in the northern island of Hokkaido, near where chipmaker Rapidus plans to build a plant. The trading company plans to select suitable sites from 1,700 potential locations to add battery storage. In Japan, as renewable energy deployment expands, output controls by utilities to balance power supply and demand have become more frequent nationwide, wasting potential clean energy that could otherwise be utilised.",

The company will increase this investment around four-fold to Rs 450 crore spread over three years starting FY25, it said in a statement.  \"As we ramp up our production capacity from around 2 million to 4 million by 2030-31, we are also accelerating our efforts to increase the share of sustainable and renewable energy sources across our operations,\" Maruti Suzuki Managing Director &amp; CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said.  Just as the company is bringing multiple technologies in products, it would also focus on multiple renewable energy sources to make the operations greener, he added.  The company said it has commenced a pilot biogas plant at its Manesar facility in FY25, harnessing the untapped potential of in-house food waste. The plant is designed to produce 0.2 tonne of biogas daily. The anticipated output is about 1 lakh standard cubic meters of biogas in FY25.  It will offset around 190 tonne of CO2 per annum.  The company also expanded its solar capacity to 43.2 MW in FY24. It is on track to add 15 MW solar capacity to its Manesar plant and 20 MW to the upcoming Kharkhoda plant over the next two years, it stated.  This will boost the total solar capacity to 78.2 MW by FY26.",

            "articleBody": "Globally, climate-related risk is increasingly being recognised as a source of financial risk for investors and lenders.The uncertainty about the timing and severity of climate-related and environmental risk threatens the resilience of individual financial institutions (FIs) and in turn, the stability of the overall financial system.It is, therefore, important that FIs focus on managing risks that may arise from climate change and environmental degradation.In this backdrop, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently released a draft disclosure framework on climate-related financial risks proposing mandatory disclosures in a phased manner for its regulated entities (REs) covering scheduled commercial banks, Tier IV primary (urban) co-operative banks, all-India financial institutions (AIFIs), all top and upper layer non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and the Indian operations of foreign banks. This framework is in continuation to the RBI&rsquo;s discussion paper on Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance released in 2022.The framework is seen as a much-needed welcome step for the financial sector, acknowledging climate-related financial risk as a systemic risk for FIs. RBI&rsquo;s draft disclosure framework is aligned with global IFRS S2 standards, which embeds recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The draft disclosure framework is divided into four pillars: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Targets and Metrices.Disclosure will allow regulated entities to manage climate risksThe framework is expected to help the REs identify and manage material near-term and long-term climate risks and incorporate them in their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). This will also serve as an important source of information for stakeholders (e.g., investors, customers, depositors and regulators) to understand the relevant risks faced and the approach adopted to address such issues. Stakeholders of the REs will not be the only ones to benefit from these disclosures. These disclosures would also support climate-centric corporates to access capital at a discounted rate once climate risk gets factored in lending decisions. In the current regime, the lack of differential loan pricing does not spur corporates to undertake capex projects pertaining to environment-friendly technologies. The disclosure practices proposed in the draft framework will enable the REs to integrate climate risk in their lending decision that will support India&rsquo;s just transition goals. FIs hold the key to an equitable climate transition through their financing and facilitation of economic activities.ChallengesDespite growing awareness on climate risk, there are several roadblocks that the REs have on their path to effective integration of climate risk in lending decisions. The biggest hurdle is the availability of accurate and verifiable data at the borrower level. This issue is even more pertinent for asset classes such as micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) loans and retail loans. For corporate loans as well, data availability is restricted to the top 1,000 listed entities, as only these have been asked by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to make ESG disclosures, with a select few doing so only on limited parameters.In the absence of accurate borrower-level data, REs may end up using assumptions and proxies as per convenience and understanding, making the disclosure non-comparable and inconsistent. Another challenge is conducting scenario analysis and stress testing for the loan book. Climate scenario analysis is a highly dynamic field, and practices are evolving rapidly. At present, there are several scenario models that have been released by different institutions such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), and the Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES). However, there is no clarity on which ones need to be followed. In addition, climate risk being a relatively nascent field, REs lack access to climate data and expertise to conduct climate scenario analysis and stress testing to assess their portfolio&rsquo;s exposure to climate-related risks.Drawing up sectoral mitigation or transition plans to reduce climate risk exposure is another uphill task for which the REs currently have limited expertise.Recommendations and the way forwardTo have consistent and comparable disclosures, there is a need to issue prescriptive guidelines that the REs can refer to in order to carry out climate risk assessment in a structured manner. The guidelines should indicate how the data-related gaps should be addressed, which scenarios should be used and how various asset classes should be treated, clearly highlighting any exclusions. To address data-related challenges for MSMEs and unorganised segments, a publicly accessible platform can be created which can be used to compute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby ensuring that assumptions and proxies remain the same. The regulated entities also have their task cut out. They will have to integrate technology systems, train staff across levels and set up policies and procedures to ensure that climate risk gets embedded in the governance structure through a three-level defence model, as prescribed by the RBI. There is no doubt that the draft disclosure framework is a welcome and significant move towards better management of climate-related financial risks for the regulated entities. However, the scramble to integrate climate risk without proper planning and consideration of borrowers can affect access to capital, which may not be an ideal situation for the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing economy.",

            "articleBody": "India is on red alert. Temperatures are soaring above 47&deg;C in some areas, while others face heavy rainfall and flooding. Last year, extreme weather struck the country on all but 47 days, causing thousands of deaths, damaging millions of hectares of crops, and killing hundreds of thousands of animals. These events highlight the severe impacts of climate change and the vulnerabilities faced by millions.As the world's most populous country, India faces the dual challenge of meeting the rising energy demand of its over 1.4 billion people while reducing its reliance on fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. According to the International Energy Agency, India must add a power system the size of the European Union by 2041 to meet its growing electricity demand. This new system must predominantly use clean energy to protect both people and the planet.India has set an ambitious goal: adding 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030 while ensuring power for all its people and industries. Significant strides have been made in solar and wind energy over the past decade, making the grid greener and the country more energy secure. In FY24, with a record 69 GW+ of renewable energy tenders issued for utility-scale projects, renewables accounted for over 70 percent of the 26 GW of new power generation capacity.Yet, even with this progress, India may face its worst power shortfall in 14 years this June, especially at night when solar power is offline. Rising temperatures and the intermittent nature of renewable energy will delay the departure of fossil fuels from India&rsquo;s energy landscape, with coal production likely doubling by 2030 to meet peak power demand.Closing the GapsFaster adoption and deployment of smart energy solutions are needed to ensure round-the-clock green power. Hence, energy storage technologies, led by large batteries and pumped hydro projects, could be game changers for India. These technologies store excess energy generated during off-peak times and release it during peak hours while balancing load and smoothening the intermittency of renewable energy. They make energy firm and dispatchable, ensuring reliable and abundant supply of green electricity nationwide, regardless of the time of day.The transition has begun. Firm and dispatchable renewable energy tenders are rising, and battery costs are dropping sharply. Wind and solar paired with storage are starting to compete with new coal in India. Withal, research into new battery chemistries and raw material recycling can drive the uptake of energy storage solutions even further across sectors.A Necessity, Not an OptionBut we need to move faster. There isn&rsquo;t much time. To stay within the 1.5-degree limit, we need &ldquo;a quantum leap in climate action,&rdquo; as United Nations Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres emphasized at the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 6th Assessment Report last year. We need &ldquo;climate action on all fronts&mdash;everything, everywhere, all at once.&rdquo;Sticking with fossil fuels to compensate for the lag in smart green energy solutions will push our net-zero targets further out of reach. We need faster adoption of energy storage to meet our COP28 goals, including tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 and doubling the pace of energy efficiency improvements.As India faces the growing threat of heatwaves and other climate-induced challenges, transitioning to low-carbon energy systems and decarbonizing transportation, industry, and buildings are imperative for sustained economic growth and energy security.Through strategic investments, supportive policies, and international cooperation, India can pave the way for a resilient, sustainable, and prosperous future for all. The time for action is now, and the path forward is clear.",

And investors appeared ready to pay a premium for the asset.The yield -- the interest rate that investors stand to gain by holding bonds -- was slightly below that of comparable 10-year Australian sovereign debt, according to market data. Australia had shopped the bond on a roadshow that visited Europe and Asia. Meetings with US buyers were held virtually.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's world record beating economic growth rate together with robust tax revenues, a fast expanding digital and financial infrastructure and a strong manufacturing sector will give the new government a base for unleashing next generation reforms that may make the country a developed nation by 2047. The new government will however have to tackle with problems like unemployment and rural distress, which seemed to have played a major role in voting pattern in states like Uttar Pradesh, while also keeping inflation under control.  Given that no party, including BJP, have a clear majority of its own, tough reforms like big ticket privatisation and labour law reforms may take a backseat.  As per the available trends, BJP is likely to win about 240 seats in a 543- member Lok Sabha. It would have to rely on its allies like TDP and JDU to form the next government.  The new government will have to build upon the 8.2 per cent GDP growth recorded in 2023-24 and carry on with the reforms to make India a USD 5 trillion economy in the next couple of years and a developed nation by 2047.  Policy experts are unanimous in their view that the government is likely to continue its focus on infrastructure-led growth, investor-friendly policies, enabling reforms, and facilitating ease of doing business.  Last week, S&amp;P Global Ratings had said that historically India has been on a high growth path with national consensus on key economic policies.  \"No matter who the incoming government is, the pro-growth policies, sustained infrastructure investments, the drive to reduce fiscal deficit -- these things have produced very good outcomes and we believe this will continue in the coming years no matter who is in charge,\" S&amp;P Global Ratings Analyst YeeFarn Phua said.  EY India Chief policy advisor DK Srivastava said the Aatmanirbhar strategy, especially focusing on knowledge intensive employment generating and strategic manufacturing, will serve India well in the long run while providing scope for increasing both services and goods exports.  \"The new government will find a solid foundation of the economy, ready to take off with the objective of fulfilling India's aim of becoming 'viksit' in the next 25 years,\" Srivastava said.  Under the Modi government's 10-year tenure India has become the fifth largest economy, from 11th globally, shaking off its image as a \"fragile\" economy prior to 2014.  The new government will have its eyes set on taking India among the top three economies in the world. The target is \"more likely\" to be realised by 2027-28 fiscal, according to 16th Finance Commission Chairman Arvind Panagariya.  Currently, the size of the Indian economy is USD 3.7 trillion and it is expected to become USD 7 trillion by 2030.  RBI has projected a 7 per cent growth rate for the current fiscal.  Deloitte South Asia CEO Romal Shetty said India is firmly on the growth trajectory as the world's fastest-growing economy and a key player in the global supply chain.  \"With the new government, we expect second-generation reforms driven by technology to make India a global hub of innovation and a thriving digital economy. We must further accelerate reforms to strengthen ease of doing business, boost inbound investment, and solidify India's position as the top destination for GCCs (global capability centres) and high-tech manufacturing, with a focus on jobs,\" Shetty said.  In fact, reflecting the buoyant sentiments S&amp;P Global Ratings last week upgraded India's outlook to positive, from stable, and said it could upgrade India's sovereign rating in next 1-2 years if the government continues reforms and adheres to the path of fiscal consolidation.  Last week, Moody's Ratings also said it expects policy continuity after the general election and continued focus on infrastructure development.  Nangia Andersen India Chairman Rakesh Nangia said the investors' community expects continued policy reforms, particularly in labour laws and the privatization of state-owned enterprises.  \"Investors are also keen on prudent fiscal management, focusing on reducing the fiscal deficit while promoting growth through strategic investments. This combination of reforms and fiscal discipline is expected to create a favourable environment for sustained economic growth and increased investor confidence,\" Nangia said.  Nangia further said that investors are also eager to see a further simplification of India's regulatory framework, more transparent and predictable policies that can enhance the ease of doing business.  \"This regulatory clarity is crucial for attracting more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and positioning India as a key manufacturing hub driven by supply chain diversification. In recent years, there has been substantial FDI inflow into sectors such as manufacturing, computer services, and renewable energy, reflecting India's growing appeal as a destination for global investment,\" Nangia said.",

            "articleBody": "People don&rsquo;t want coal, oil or gas. Rather they want the products and services that the energy provides &mdash; home heating, public transport or sheets of steel. The distinction is important as we move away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy, because it will mean the world could be consuming less energy in total without losing out the benefits it currently enjoys.We waste about a third of the total energy produced on mining, refining and transporting fossil fuels. Crude oil on its own isn&rsquo;t much use until it is converted to gasoline, jet fuel and fuel oil. But creating those products requires huge refineries consuming vast amounts of energy. Crucially, all that dirty energy has a huge planet-warming impact. Producing solar panels and wind turbines has a much smaller carbon footprint.Moving to clean energy could also bring savings of up to $4.6 trillion each year, according to new research from Colorado-based think tank RMI.Another third of the world&rsquo;s total energy is wasted in burning fossil fuels in highly inefficient machines. For example, a fossil fuel-powered car converts only a quarter of the energy in gasoline into motion. An electric car converts more than three-quarters of the energy in the battery to moving. Similarly, while burning one unit of natural gas in a boiler generates one unit of heat, an electric heat pump uses one unit of electricity to provide three units of heat.Experts refer to the sum total of energy content found in nature, such as blocks of coal, as primary energy. After accounting for losses from production and transportation, what remains is final energy.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much room to become more efficient,&rdquo; said Daan Walter of RMI. &ldquo;Most of the discussion on energy security is to secure supplies of energy, but there is very little acknowledgement that reducing demand for energy also helps with energy security.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s why the white paper that Walter co-authored with his RMI colleagues is titled: The Incredible Inefficiency of the Fossil Energy System. Without alternatives to fossil fuels, that incredible inefficiency was just the cost of doing business. But as the world moves to generating more power from renewables and converts more of its energy-consuming devices to electricity, the overall efficiency of the system goes up.At the COP28 climate summit in Dubai last year, countries signed off on two major goals among a long list: tripling renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency. The International Energy Agency today put out its report card on the renewables goal. Its conclusion is that, if countries achieved their stated plans, the world will have 2.2 times as much renewables in 2030 over 2022 levels. That&rsquo;s short of its tripling goal and thus a lot more needs to be done.The efficiency goal hasn&rsquo;t yet received a report card. Still, there is much we can glean based on the data we already have. The goal is defined in terms of improving the energy intensity of the economy, which is how much energy it takes to generate a dollar of economic activity.Over the past few decades, the energy intensity of the economy &mdash; or energy efficiency &mdash; has been increasing at between 1 per cent and 2 per cent each year, while global economic growth hovers at 3 per cent. That means, even as the global economy is becoming more energy efficient, it&rsquo;s not enough to reduce the total amount of energy the world uses. Doubling of energy efficiency up to 4 per cent annually could help the world use less energy, even while keeping economic growth at the same levels.  The renewables goal is hard, but the push to achieve it is likely to be stronger than the one behind the energy efficiency goal. &ldquo;Very few people have a sense of what it means, or if it&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; said Walter. That&rsquo;s because energy efficiency doesn&rsquo;t make for great banter, he added. It might be because the steps to get there, such as better insulation or software for energy management, aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; solutions.But that can&rsquo;t be the full story. Electric cars and heat pumps are energy efficient machines. One of those entered the public consciousness with a &ldquo;cool&rdquo; factor. The efficiency gains of these machines perhaps didn&rsquo;t matter in summing up the cool bits. That has been a failure of our imagination &mdash; for now.",

            "articleBody": "WASHINGTON: If the Biden administration had its way, far more electronic chips would be made in factories in, say, Texas or Arizona.They would then be shipped to partner countries, such as Costa Rica or Vietnam or Kenya, for final assembly and sent out into the world to run everything from refrigerators to supercomputers.Those places may not be the first that come to mind when people think of semiconductors. But administration officials are trying to transform the world's chip supply chain and are negotiating intensely to do so.The core elements of the plan include getting foreign companies to invest in chipmaking in the United States and finding other countries to set up factories to finish the work. Officials and researchers in Washington call it part of the new \"chip diplomacy.\"The Biden administration argues that producing more of the tiny brains of electronic devices in the United States will help make the country more prosperous and secure. President Joe Biden boasted about his efforts in his interview on Friday with ABC News, during which he said he had gotten South Korea to invest billions of dollars in chipmaking in the United States.But a key part of the strategy is unfolding outside America's borders, where the administration is trying to work with partners to ensure that investments in the United States are more durable.If the nascent effort progresses, it may help the administration meet some of its broad strategic goals. It wants to blunt security concerns involving China, which is growing its chip manufacturing while making threats against Taiwan, a global centre of chip technology. And it wants to lower the risks of disruptions to the chip supply chain -- risks that became evident during the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine, both of which threw global shipping and manufacturing into turmoil.\"The focus has been to do our best to expand the capacity in a diverse set of countries to make those global supply chains more resilient,\" said Ramin Toloui, a Stanford University professor who recently served as assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, which is at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to set up new supply chains.The administration aims to do that not just for chips, but for green energy technology such as electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. China is by far the biggest player in those industries.Biden and his aides say that dominance by Chinese companies is a national security issue as well as a human rights problem, given that some of the manufacturing takes place in Xinjiang, a region of China where officials force members of some Muslim ethnic groups to work in factories.Over three years of the Biden administration, the United States has attracted $395 billion of investment in semiconductor manufacturing and $405 billion for making green technology and generating clean power, Toloui said.Many of the companies investing in that kind of manufacturing in the United States are based in Asian countries known for their tech industries -- Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, for instance -- and in Europe. One is SK Hynix, a South Korean chipmaker that is building a $3.8 billion factory in Indiana. The State Department says that the project is the largest-ever investment in that state and that it has the potential to bring more than 1,000 jobs to the region.Secretary of State Antony Blinken mentioned that project in a speech last month at a conference in Maryland aimed at encouraging foreign investment in the United States. And he underscored how he hoped legislation enacted by Biden would draw foreign investment to U.S. high-tech manufacturing by \"modernising our roads, our rail, our broadband, our electric grid.\"The policy efforts, he added, are aimed at \"strengthening and diversifying supply chains, turbocharging domestic manufacturing, spurring key industries of the future, from semiconductors to clean energy.\"The Commerce Department has also played a major role in the effort to shore up the chip supply chain and is disbursing $50 billion to companies and organisations to research, develop and manufacture chips.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo led an in-depth study of global chip supply chains to identify vulnerabilities and has worked with foreign governments to discuss opportunities for additional investments overseas.The topic was a focus of Raimondo's trip to Costa Rica this past spring as she met with local officials and executives from Intel, which runs a factory there. (Toloui spoke at a semiconductor manufacturing conference in Costa Rica in January.) She also discussed diversifying the semiconductor supply chain on trips to Panama and Thailand.But reworking global supply chains so that they are less dependent on East Asia will be a challenge. East Asian chip factories offer more cutting-edge technology, a larger pool of talented engineers and lower costs than American factories are projected to.Taiwan produces more than 60% of the world's chips and nearly all of the most advanced chips, which are used in computers, smartphones and other devices.By comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry could face a shortage of up to 90,000 workers over the next few years, according to several estimates.Governments in China, Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere are also aggressively subsidising their own chip industries.Still, billions of dollars of new U.S. investment are expected to somewhat shift global supply chains. The U.S. share of global chip manufacturing is projected to rise to 14% by 2032, from 10% today, according to a May report from the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group.Some administration officials have engaged in a more coercive form of chip diplomacy to prevent China from developing versions of American technology. That approach has focused on persuading a handful of countries -- Japan and the Netherlands, in particular -- to stop companies from selling some chipmaking tools to China.Alan Estevez, who leads the bureau within the Commerce Department in charge of export controls, visited Japan and the Netherlands last month to try to persuade the countries to block companies there from selling certain advanced technology to China.By contrast, Toloui and his aides have flown around the world to scout out countries and companies that might want to invest in the American industry and set up factories that would form the endpoint of the supply chain. Toloui said his bureau's work was an element of Biden's recent enactment of legislation to create more manufacturing jobs in the United States, including the infrastructure act and the CHIPS and Science Act.The CHIPS act includes $500 million of funding annually for the administration to create secure supply chains and to protect semiconductor technology. The State Department draws on that money to find countries for supply chain development. Officials are organising studies on a range of countries to see how infrastructure and workforces can be brought up to certain standards to ensure smooth chip assembly, packaging and shipping.The countries now in the program are Costa Rica, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines and Vietnam. The U.S. government is bringing in Kenya.Job training is a priority in this supply chain creation, Toloui said. He has talked to Arizona State University about being a partner with overseas institutions to develop training programs. One such institution is Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City, which he visited in May.Martijn Rasser, managing director of Datenna, a research firm that focuses on China, said this network of alliances was a strategic advantage that the United States has over China.For the United States to try to do everything itself would be too expensive, he said. And going it alone would not recognise the reality that technology today is much more diffused globally than it was a few decades ago, with various countries playing important roles in the chip supply chain.",

            "articleBody": "The world&rsquo;s sleekest dump sits on an island near the picturesque port of Bergen in Norway. Strictly speaking, the gleaming Northern Lights terminal is just the gateway to the actual dump, where carbon dioxide will be offloaded from ships and then pumped down into an aquifer 1.6 miles below the seabed, about 60 miles offshore, keeping it locked away.Getting to net zero mostly means stopping doing things that emit carbon. A supplement to this is capturing those emissions and storing them, like refuse in a landfill. In theory, carbon capture and storage, or CCS, offers the ultimate climate hedge for fossil fuel producers, albeit at a cost of perhaps $10 trillion through 2050.More likely, it will play a vital role in mopping up the most stubborn emissions, but will be outcompeted by faster-moving alternatives for energy transition. Moreover, the incentives required to make it work would present, in themselves, a profound risk to fossil fuel producers.Of the emissions that need to be eliminated to achieve net zero in 2050, Bloomberg NEF projects CCS accounting for 16 per cent of them. The amount being captured annually by 2050, more than 8 gigatons, would be bigger than the total energy-related emissions of the Americas today.  CCS typically involves chemically &ldquo;scrubbing&rdquo; carbon dioxide from the smokestack of, say, a power plant, then using heat to release the gas that&rsquo;s captured before compression, transportation and storage. Another, newer set of technologies under development called direct air capture effectively suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, rather than from chimneys. All of this is quite nascent: Global capture capacity operating today is equivalent to about 0.1 per cent of energy-related emissions.None of this is cheap. Carbon capture on a US gas-fired power plant boosts the cost of its electricity by 54 per cent, factoring in capital and running costs, according to Bloomberg NEF estimates. The cost for industrial processes such as making steel or cement, including transportation and storage, range above $100 per ton, compared with current European carbon futures prices of around $76. As for direct air capture, that costs about 15 times the futures price.  Northern Lights epitomises the role of government in making this work. While it is a joint venture between three oil companies &mdash; Equinor ASA, Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE &mdash; the prime mover is the state. Norway funds 80 per cent of the initial investment, up to a cap, plus some of the operating costs (Equinor is also 67 per cent state-owned). In return, the project won&rsquo;t charge two emitters selected by the government, a cement plant and a waste-to-energy plant near Oslo, to store their carbon dioxide. A second phase will involve commercial customers, with two having signed contracts.&ldquo;The intent is to demonstrate the CCS chain can work and break the loop of &lsquo;who&rsquo;s ever going to invest in this new business?&rsquo;,&rdquo; Tim Heijn, Northern Lights&rsquo; managing director, said when I visited recently. As if to reinforce the showcase aspect, we met in a comfortable auditorium sized, I was told, to accommodate a busload of visitors plus guides. Government backing is needed because carbon dioxide is mostly worthless; it is the gas&rsquo;s absence that has value. Nick Cooper, executive chair of Storegga Ltd., a UK-based CCS developer, draws an analogy with efforts to clean up filthy cities in the 19th century: &ldquo;Ultimately, there was a sea change and people said we need a sewage system to deal with our waste that we had previously been throwing out for free.&rdquo; CCS is a planetary-scale waste management business.Hence, its business model relies on revenue constructed by regulation. This includes subsidies like the generous 45Q tax credit in the US, worth up to $85 per ton, as well as emitters paying for CCS in order to avoid the cost of penalties.Such inducements aim to encourage scale, reducing costs. Projects like Northern Lights and Storegga&rsquo;s embody this as logistical hubs to aggregate emissions from plants across Europe. Similarly, US CCS projects are effectively overlaid on the existing oil and gas and industrial centres of the Gulf Coast.This makes sense but also gets at the challenges of scaling up an industry that is effectively the mirror image of the existing fossil fuel-based industrial system. My first glimpse of Northern Lights&rsquo; towering storage tanks and pipes reminded me of an oil refinery. Success requires proximity to the right geological structures and emitting customers &mdash; an advantage for areas like the North Sea and the US Gulf of Mexico &mdash; plus lots of scrubbers, pipelines, tanks and ships. The International Energy Agency estimates CCS will need somewhere between 60,000 and 360,000 miles of dedicated pipelines, up from less than 6,000 today, to fulfil net-zero ambitions. As for direct capture, the sheer volume of air it must move presents an implacable, and actual, physical headwind.Bigger scale will result in some efficiencies, but CCS is competing with alternatives enjoying much faster learning rates, notably manufactured solar and wind power (another big-project technology, nuclear power, can relate). For example, Bloomberg NEF anticipates the cost of US gas-fired power with carbon capture falling by about 3 per cent-6 per cent a year, through 2030 before flattening out. Renewables, meanwhile, have enjoyed annual cost declines in the mid-teens for years and are already the cheapest source of electricity in most of the world. This presents a particular complication for CCS projections because fossil-fuel generators seeking to curb emissions are expected to be the biggest customer base by far.  Yet any power plant developer considering adding CCS must factor in the risk posed by rising renewables. As the latter take more market share, they squeeze down utilisation of traditional power plants, thereby raising the cost per ton of captured carbon considerably.There is a more robust economic case for CCS in industrial processes such as manufacturing cement, metals and chemicals. The high heat requirements and, in some cases, chemical reactions emitting carbon mean electrification can only get so far in addressing these emissions. One of Northern Lights&rsquo; two commercial contracts signed so far is with a fertiliser and ammonia producer in the Netherlands.Such challenges and uncertainties are Northern Lights hopes to &ldquo;break the loop&rdquo; of low investment. It has its work cut out: CCS investment lags far behind that of other cleantech, which in turn limits the scope for efficiency gains that might unlock more spending.  The point isn&rsquo;t that CCS projects won&rsquo;t get built; they will play a useful role, particularly for industrial sectors. One potentially big driver is the rollout of the European Union&rsquo;s carbon border adjustment mechanism, externalising the bloc&rsquo;s carbon pricing. That may well catalyse similar measures elsewhere, including in the US, thereby creating wider markets for decarbonised commodities.Such expansion, however, will remain tied to government support to a greater degree than in other cleantech sectors better placed to outgrow subsidies. That&rsquo;s especially so because, unlike the stench and pests of festering sewage, carbon dioxide is odourless and its hazardous effects accrete over decades. Our desire to get rid of it is a regulatory construct rather than innate &mdash; hence the contentious politics. Therein lies the flaw of seeing CCS as insurance for fossil fuel demand. Having CCS break out of niche applications to become widespread would require societies to internalise the risks of climate change to such a degree that they are willing to incentivise even the most expensive forms of emissions abatement on a sustained basis. In that world, carbon pricing, either explicit or implicit, is robust, sustained and global &mdash; which would ultimately decimate demand for fossil fuels overall. CCS is a useful hedge against the energy transition&rsquo;s own limitations but not against that transition itself. ",

He said the ongoing negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and India \"hold promise to enhance trade flows and economic cooperation significantly\". The Federation of European Business in India (FEBI), the official Chamber of EU businesses in India, supported by the EU Delegation in India and the embassies of the EU member states, has held its first Annual General Meeting, marking a significant milestone in its new journey, according to an official statement issued on Monday. The meeting formalised the Board of Directors with 14 elected members and confirmed key office bearers, it said. Remi Maillard, President and Managing Director of Airbus in India and South Asia, will lead FEBI as its first president, with Sanjay Tiwari, Public Affairs Advisor to Maersk India Pvt. Ltd. and Oscar Esteban, President, Indo-Spanish Chamber of Commerce, elected as vice-president and treasurer, the statement said. The inaugural AGM was held in New Delhi on July 4. \"EU-India relations have been on an ascending trajectory, with a growing economic footprint. Over 4,500 European companies are present in India, providing 6.5 million direct and indirect jobs,\" Delphin, Ambassador of the EU to India and Honorary President of FEBI, was quoted as saying in the statement. \"The EU is India's largest trading partner in goods, with trade amounting to EUR 123 billion in 2022-23, and ranks among the top three investors in India. Ongoing negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and India hold promise to enhance trade flows and economic cooperation significantly. \"FEBI will bring a very much needed business perspective that will contribute to the further expansion and bringing together of the EU-India economic and trade ecosystem. It will be a true force multiplier,\" he said. FEBI will maintain close and constructive relations with Indian and European authorities, acting as a \"credible intermediary\" between government and businesses and an \"advocacy place\" for pro-business policies and solutions, said the statement issued by the Delegation of the European Union to India and Bhutan. Currently, FEBI boasts a membership of 73 companies representing a diverse cross-section of EU member states across 10 sectors in India, including aerospace, automotive, agri-food products, chemicals and pharmaceutical, consumer and luxury goods, finance and insurance, telecom and ICT and digital trade, machinery and capital goods, energy and renewables, and transportation and logistics. More companies are in the process of joining FEBI, it said. FEBI's mission is to articulate the collective business interests of EU companies in India and facilitate the growth in trade and investment between the EU and India. \"It is as much an honour as a responsibility to helm FEBI as its inaugural president. FEBI will serve as a bridge between Europe and India to deepen bilateral trade and investment. India's rapid expansion holds significant potential for European companies to grow here in a symbiotic way,\" Maillard was quoted as saying in the statement. \"We will work with our Indian and EU stakeholders and industrial partners to ensure that trade opens more opportunities, thereby helping both regions to grow and thrive together,\" he said after his confirmation as president of FEBI.",

This growth is part of the worldwide drive to electrify economies and achieve decarbonization targets.Solar sector set for fourfold increaseThe solar energy sector is expected to see a substantial increase, with cumulative installed global solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity projected to nearly quadruple from 2024 to 2033. According to Wood Mackenzie, approximately 4.7 terawatts direct current (TWdc) will be installed during this period, with China accounting for half of this capacity expansion.\"Solar PV leads the deployment race, accounting for 59 per cent of global capacity due to come online between 2024 and 2033,\" said Luke Lewandowski, vice president, global renewables research at Wood Mackenzie. Further insights reveal challenges due to grid constraints and pricing volatility. \"Ultra-low module prices intensified the rate of solar deployments last year in Europe and China and will continue to do so in the near-term,\" added Juan Monge, principal analyst, distributed solar PV at Wood Mackenzie.Wind energy to add over 1.7 TW globallyThe wind energy sector is also poised for significant growth, with more than 1.7 TW expected to be added globally over the next decade. China's policy initiatives are particularly influential, driving much of the expected expansion. \"China&rsquo;s central government announced a plan in May to promote the energy transition and ensure the country meets carbon-neutral targets,\" noted Lucas Stavole, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.Energy storage sees sixfold increaseEnergy storage capacity, excluding pumped hydro, is anticipated to grow by more than 600 per cent, with nearly 1 TW of new capacity expected to be operational by 2033. The growth in energy storage is one of the fastest in the power industry, essential for integrating rising renewable energy sources. \"Global energy storage deployment in 2023 achieved record-breaking growth of 162 per cent compared to 2022,\" stated Anna Darmani, principal analyst, energy storage, at Wood Mackenzie.This surge in renewable energy installations reflects a robust global commitment to transitioning towards more sustainable energy systems despite existing challenges such as inflation, grid constraints, and permitting issues.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: As the nation prepares for the presentation of the Union Budget 2024-25 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23, the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) has laid out its expectations by submitting a series of key recommendations aimed at tax and GST reforms to bolster the energy sector. The Budget Session, which begins on July 22 and extends until August 12, will be the first full fiscal year budget under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third tenure.NSEFI's proposals focus significantly on enhancing the tax framework for companies organized as Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) in power generation and infrastructure projects. It has suggested introducing group relief for income-tax purposes, enabling parent and subsidiary SPVs to be treated as a single assessee. This move is intended to address the financial imbalances caused by isolated fiscal assessments of SPVs, where some may incur losses due to substantial initial investments while others or their parent entities record profits.Additionally, NSEFI has called for an extension of the sunset date for section 115BAB of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This section, which offers a reduced corporate tax rate of 15 per cent to new manufacturing companies, including those in power generation, is currently set to expire on March 31, 2024. Citing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant economic slowdowns, NSEFI is requesting a further extension to March 31, 2026, to accommodate delays in project commissioning due to external disruptions.On the GST front, NSEFI is advocating for modifications to the valuation mechanism for Solar Power Generating Systems, following a government decision that increased the GST rate for goods from 5 per cent to 12 per cent, thereby raising the effective rate from 8.90 per cent to 13.80 per cent. NSEFI proposes adjusting the valuation ratio from 70:30 to 85:15 and reducing the GST rate for goods back to 5 per cent to reduce the effective rate to about 6.95 per cent.Furthermore, NSEFI recommends a concessional GST rate of 5 per cent on goods and services used in developing Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs). This reduction would decrease costs by 10 per cent and potentially lower PSP tariffs by approximately 0.60 INR/kWh, facilitating inflation-free and fixed tariff Renewable Energy with Round-The-Clock (RE-RTC) for 25 years.These strategic recommendations by NSEFI are geared towards addressing specific challenges faced by the renewable energy sector and are anticipated to influence key policy decisions in the upcoming Union Budget.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India is slated to capture 3 per cent of the Asia-Pacific's offshore wind capacity over the next decade, as per the GWEC&rsquo;s Global Offshore Wind Report 2024. This aligns with the Indian government's recent sanctioning of a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme, underscoring its commitment to renewable energy and specifically to offshore wind energy projects.The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved an outlay of &#8377;7,453 crore (~ USD 0.89 billion), earmarked for the setup and commissioning of 1 GW of offshore wind projects split between Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. This funding also includes &#8377;600 crore (~ USD 0.06 billion) designated for upgrading two key ports to enhance logistical operations for these projects.Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Bhupinder Singh Bhalla emphasized the government&rsquo;s role in promoting an enabling environment for offshore wind projects, \"The Union Cabinet&rsquo;s approval for a viability gap funding scheme with a total outlay of &#8377;7,453 crore (USD 90 million approx.) for the installation and commissioning of 1 GW of offshore wind projects including a grant of &#8377;600 crore (USD 7 million approx.) for upgradation of two ports would be significant support for the establishment of the necessary offshore ecosystem. This will lay a strong foundation for success in the 37 GW sea bed lease tender trajectory aimed at harnessing the offshore wind potential in the country.&rdquo;GWEC India Chair and Vice Chairman of Suzlon, Girish Tanti, highlighted the importance of the VGF scheme's approval, \"Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the country has deepened its feet in the wind energy sector and witnessed widespread growth in non-fossil fuel energy capacity addition. With offshore wind, the wind industry has a tremendous opportunity to help India's NDCs while also building a robust value chain through investments, policy measures, and partnerships that increase jobs and environmental benefits. GWEC India looks forward to continuing our work with national and state governments to drive forward the deployment of offshore wind in India.\"Further endorsing the government's initiatives, Rebecca Williams, Chief Strategy Officer - Offshore Wind, GWEC, praised the VGF's approval, \"GWEC is very pleased to see that the Viability Gap Funding has been approved by the cabinet. This moment sends an important signal about India&rsquo;s commitment to progressing offshore wind at scale. GWEC&rsquo;s 2024 Offshore Wind Report shows that offshore wind can accelerate just transition in the energy sector, playing an important role in sparking new jobs and investments in the sector. Facilitative measures taken by the Indian government, including the approval of VGF by the Union Cabinet, help build confidence that will enable offshore wind to graduate from the status of an emerging technology in India.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India must resolve issues around land allocation and transmission connectivity for Renewable Energy (RE) projects and also focus more on setting up wind energy generation capacity for the ambitious goal of 50 GW annual RE capacity creation to materialize, Srivatsan Iyer, the global Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hero Future Energies, has said.\"The Government&rsquo;s target of setting up 50 GW capacity annually is commendable. To actualize this, we will have to take care of on ground challenges, especially with regards to evacuation capacity keeping pace with the installation of new projects. Similarly, I am hopeful we will find an efficient solution for land availability and Right of Way (RoW) issues,\" Iyer told ETEnergyworld in an interview.Hero Future Energies is the renewable energy arm of the Hero Group with a portfolio of 4.5 Gigawatt renewable energy projects across India, Ukraine and Vietnam. The company is also backed by global investors including International Finance Corporation (IFC) and KKR.Iyer said the industry is waiting to see what happens to Green Hydrogen from a policy standpoint. \"The recent waiver of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) requirement for renewable energy production towards green hydrogen in SEZs and EOUs was very positive. We hope to see basic customs duty (BCD) waivers on modules as well, in addition to ALMM waivers,\" he said.The potential of renewable energy in India looks more exciting today than it has been in a while because of various factors, including the new types of complex Round-the-Clock (RTC) tenders for supply of more dispatchable renewable energy, according to Iyer. While renewable energy from standalone wind or solar power is undoubtedly cheap, costing between Rs 2.60 per unit and Rs 3.40 per unit, converting this to a dispatchable supply involves procuring additional power at rates over Rs 6.50 per unit for significant periods of the day. In comparison, a wind-solar-battery hybrid project where tariffs have been discovered at rates between Rs 5.25 per unit and Rs 5.40 per unit, is more economically competitive and available round-the-clock with 80-90 percent compliance.\"We also need to set up at least 10-15 GW a year of wind energy capacity, against the current trend of 3 GW. This would require adequate Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) infrastructure. On that front, many domestic manufacturers have stepped up capacity to the tune of 15 GW a year and therefore its supply would not be a bottleneck,\" Iyer said. He added that another bottleneck could be the installation infrastructure, including the WTG erection and the availability of cranes and Engineering, Procurement &amp; Construction (EPC) services. \"We do not see their pace keeping up for a level of 10-15 GW wind capacity a year. But the most critical aspect, where the industry needs help from the government, is land. The private sector can take care of the rest of the issues,\" Iyer said.On green hydrogen front, the government needs to step in and look at introducing a demand mandate and ease charges like import duty on electrolysers and batteries and also provide some waivers on transmission charges and surcharges etc. HFE has won five bids for RE projects in the past 12 months. All of these bids are for supply of peak dispatchable renewable power. This is in line with the company's broad strategy to ensure it participates in these technologically more intensive and complex bids.\"There is already a pipeline of 4-5 additional complex bids that have been announced for the next couple of months. However, the biggest challenge continues to be connectivity. There has been a rush for connectivity especially in areas where wind speed is attractive,\" Iyer said. The industry is currently engaged in multiple discussions with MNRE to ensure aligning the timing of scheduled commissioning dates of bids with new evacuation capacity readiness. The idea is to ensure projects are not put in jeopardy because of substation commissioning issues.HFE is currently executing 2.6 GW capacity projects from the bids it has won. Of this, PPAs have been signed for 900 MW and construction is already underway, even as it waits for PPAs to be signed for the remaining 1.7 GWp of capacity. It expects all of these to be signed by September-October this year. Iyer informed that the firm is also working on some opportunities in the Commercial and Industrial (C&amp;I) open access space that will also complement project pipeline in the immediate future. It is broadly targeting an annual run rate of around 400 MW every year of C&amp;I open access projects.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Global hydroelectric generation slumped to a five-year low last year as a result of lower-than-average rainfall across China, North America and India, contributing to record fossil fuel combustion and emissions in 2023. Global hydro generation amounted to 4,240 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2023 down from a record 4,359 billion kWh in 2020, according to the Statistical Review of World Energy published by the UK Energy Institute. The slump over the last three years has been the largest on record, forcing the world's biggest producers to revert to coal and gas-fired power plants to replace lost generation, amplifying the upward trend in fossil fuel burning. But hydro is set to rebound this year thanks to higher rainfall and snow melt in key areas, which will combine with rapid deployment of wind and solar power to curb growth in fossil fuel use in 2024.  Chartbook: Global hydroelectric generation  Global hydro generation is highly concentrated, with two-thirds occurring in just seven countries - China (30%), Brazil (9%), Canada (9%), the United States (6%), Russia (5%), India (4%) and Norway (3%). China's generation fell by a massive 96 billion kWh in 2023 compared with three years earlier, accounting for 80% of the generation lost worldwide, according to the Statistical Review. Prolonged drought across south and central China cut water volumes down the Yangtze and other river systems, slashing power output even though the country brought new hydro dams and turbines into service. But there were also sharp downturns compared with three years earlier in the United States (-46 billion kWh), Canada (-22 billion kWh), India (-15 billion kWh) and Russia (-15 billion kWh). In the United States, hydro output fell to the lowest for 22 years, mostly as a result of an extended drought across the western part of the country, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  HYDRO REBOUND The outlook for hydro generators is looking more promising this year, with heavier rain and snowfall in most key producing areas, likely to drive a record one-year increase in output. China's generation had already climbed by 57 billion kWh (16%) in the first five months of 2024 compared with 2023, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Since then, southern and central regions have been inundated with heavier than normal monsoon rains, triggering multiple flood alerts on the Yangtze and other river systems. With most of the main flood season still ahead in July and August, China's generation is on course to set new records as heavy river flows enable the country to make full use of newly installed turbines. By May 2024, China had installed 423 million kilowatts (kW) of generating capacity, up from 370 million kW when generation last peaked in 2020, so there is potential to increase output significant if river volumes are high enough. In Brazil, hydro has already set a new record of 206 billion kWh in the first five months of the year, surpassing the previous high of 199 billion kWh. Reservoirs connected to the main Southeast and Midwest electricity transmission system, which account for most of the country's hydro potential, were storing enough water to generate 101 billion kWh at the end of June. Storage was down from 129 billion kWh at this point last year but was otherwise the highest since 2012, according to data from the country's transmission operator. U.S. hydro generation has also started to recover from last year's low, with the government forecasting it will be 6% higher in 2024. In China the main substitute for hydro is coal, while in Brazil and the United States it is gas, so the rebound in hydro is likely to trim fossil fuel combustion and emissions. If the hydro rebound is sufficiently large, and accompanied by continued rapid deployment of wind and solar farms, both of which seem likely, it could be enough to create a peak in coal burning and fossil fuel emissions, at least temporarily.By John Kemp",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: Britain's renewables industry has called on the new Labour government to increase the country's renewable auction budget by hundreds of millions of pounds to help meet its offshore wind target and wider goal to decarbonise the power grid. Labour swept to victory in Britain's election last week and the party has pledged to expand the country's offshore wind capacity to 55 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, from around 15 GW now as part of wider climate goals. \"The only way for the new government to stay on track to meet their targets is to amend the (auction) budget upwards,\" said Tom Glover, UK Country Chair at RWE which plans to build new British offshore wind projects. To spur investment, renewable project developers can bid for government-backed price guarantees for the electricity produced, called Contracts for Difference (CfDs), with the budget for this year's sixth CfD auction set at 1 billion pounds ($1.28 billion), with 800 million pounds of this earmarked for offshore wind. \"To increase investment in shovel-ready offshore wind projects this year, unlocking capital investment and lowering average household bills, the government should raise this (offshore wind pot) to 1.5 billion pounds\" Nick Hibberd, markets and economics policy analyst at industry group Renewable UK said. The fifth auction, held in 2023 failed to tract any offshore wind projects as the incentives offered were deemed too low by developers, setting back progress towards meeting the former Conservative government's 50 GW by 2030 target. \"(This year's auction) is the last chance to be sure which projects will get CfDs for the projects to be delivered by 2030 so we really need to maximize the potential of this auction,\" said Damien Zachlod, managing director at EnBW generation UK, which has joint ventures with BP to build British offshore wind projects. Ashutosh Padelkar, associate for GB Power &amp; Renewables at consultancy Aurora, said the portion of auction funds dedicated to offshore wind would likely need to at least double to 1.65-1.95 billion pounds to support the 10 gigawatts of wind projects eligible to bid in the current round. \"This would need to be followed through with similar ambition in the next (seventh) allocation round to ensure industry confidence,\" he said. Britain's department for Energy Security and Net Zero did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: Chinese authorities are considering ordering large-scale investigations of energy storage plants for fire risks, in a sign of tighter standards for China's booming battery energy storage industry, the 21st Century Business Herald reported on Monday. Prompted by recent disasters at energy storage facilities, authorities have already carried out safety inspections at some energy storage manufacturers, developers and operators, the report said. A June 26 fire at a lithium battery factory in Seoul, sparked by battery explosions, killed 23 people, most of them Chinese migrant workers, making it one of the deadliest industrial accidents in recent years. In March, following a fire at a commercial energy storage facility in China's Wenzhou, in eastern Zhejiang province, the local National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) ordered a round of inspections and fire safety upgrades. Many of China's energy storage plants at renewables facilities, built to fulfil local government mandates, have been little used and could unknowingly pose safety risks, the 21st Century report added, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Looking to boost the use of renewable electricity by smoothing out fluctuations in wind and solar generation, China has in recent years built the world's largest battery energy storage fleet, mostly using lithium ion batteries. But fire risk remains a concern with the technology, especially with lower-quality batteries, experts say. The NDRC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on Monday. The Ministry of Emergency Management could not immediately be reached for comment. ",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism aims to treat imported goods the same as EU-produced goods to help global decarbonisation, the Director-General of the European Commission has said following a visit to India to discuss tax and custom issues. Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is the European Union's planned tax on the carbon emitted while making goods imported from countries like India and China. The move has sparked a debate at multilateral forums, including the United Nations climate conferences, as the poorer countries fear such tariffs will harm livelihoods and economic growth.Director-General of the European Commission, Gerassimos Thomas, led a group of officials to New Delhi to discuss tax and customs issues, with a focus on CBAM, on July 1 and 2. He met the Indian government officials and business leaders to explore the manner in which it might affect the Indian industries and explain CBAM's goals and timeline.Thomas welcomed India's plans to decarbonise its economy, underlining the shared commitment to collaborate with India in their decarbonisation efforts, the European Commission said in a statement.\"My mission was an excellent opportunity to have direct, in-depth and meaningful interactions with my Indian counterparts and business representatives on a wide range of tax and customs matters, as well as CBAM. The importance of EU-India relations is growing. Both sides want to deepen this relationship to benefit business,\" Thomas said.Through CBAM, the EU hopes to set a price on the carbon emitted to make energy-intensive products like iron, steel, cement, fertiliser and aluminium in other countries. The aim is to both reduce emissions from imports and create a level-playing field for goods made in the European bloc that must meet stricter green standards.The developing countries are worried that the tax under the EU's planned CBAM would harm their economies and make it too expensive to trade with the bloc.\"Europe is a net importer of CBAM goods and wants to make sure that we continue importing goods with the lowest possible carbon intensity to contribute to decarbonisation at a global level. CBAM ensures that imported goods are treated equally to goods produced in the EU.\"It does not discriminate and has a very gradual phase-in to give maximum predictability for investors and businesses,\" the Director-General said.He said the visit was an opportunity to listen, learn and improve.\"To listen to the challenges that Indian businesses face when implementing CBAM. To learn, for example, if and how Indian Micro-Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) are possibly affected (as the CBAM measure normally affects only big enterprises). And to reiterate and jointly explore efforts to adapt and improve the CBAM measure,\" Thomas said.Technical meetings with the Ministry of Power, including the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, will continue. An assessment report on the transition period will be submitted to the Council and the European Parliament before the end of next year and will be public, thereby providing the opportunity for Indian industry and authorities to comment and discuss with the European Commission the next steps.Above and beyond CBAM, the visit confirmed the mutual interest in deepening the exchanges on respective carbon trading markets, pricing mechanisms and EU cooperation with India in the domain of energy efficiency, renewables and clean tech.On taxation, the Director-General discussed with his Indian government counterparts the 'Two-Pillar Solution' to address the tax challenges of the digitalisation of the economy. India confirmed its commitment to 'Pillar 2'.Regarding the UN Framework Convention on international tax cooperation, it was mutually agreed that the overlap between the different tracks should be avoided, the statement said.The EU and India have had a long-standing Customs Cooperation (CCMAA Agreement) since 2004. Director-General Thomas used this week's interactions to focus on the latest challenges of customs -- cross-border e-commerce and designer drug precursors, it said.India agreed to reinforce the bilateral ties on this and have closer cooperation on notably designer drug precursors under the existing CCMAA Agreement. Ongoing negotiations for an EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) include an upgrade of this customs cooperation, the statement said.",

            "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Austria will be the first prime ministerial visit from India to that country in 41 years, the last being of Indira Gandhi in 1983. Modi's official visit on July 9-10 comes when India and Austria mark 75 years of their diplomatic relations. Jawaharlal Nehru travelled to Austria in 1955 in the first prime ministerial visit since diplomatic ties were established in 1949. \"India and Austria have had a regular exchange of visits including at the level of leaders, ministers and parliamentarians highlighting the importance that both countries accord to further strengthening their relations,\" according to a profile of India-Austria bilateral relations put up on the website of the Ministry of External Affairs. It also shares the history of PM-level and President-level visits from India to Austria. Then prime minister Indira Gandhi visited Austria in 1971 which was followed by the visit of then Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky in 1980. Gandhi's visit in 1983 was followed by the visit of then chancellor Fred Sinowatz in 1984, it said. Gandhi was in Vienna from June 16-18 during her 1983 visit, people familiar with the matter said. While there have been no prime ministerial visits from India since Indira Gandhi's visit, there have been President-level visits to the country. The then president K R Narayanan visited Austria in 1999; then president Heinz Fischer visited in 2005; then Austrian Vice Chancellor Josef Proll in 2010; and then president Pratibha Devisingh Patil in 2011, according to the profile on the MEA website. Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra on Friday briefed media about Prime Minister Modi's upcoming tour to Russia and Austria from July 8-10. The prime minister will pay an official visit to Moscow on July 8-9 at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin for the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit. In the second leg of the trip, Modi will be visiting Austria on July 9-10 at the invitation of the Chancellor of Austria. \"This will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Austria. Prime Minister had met then Austrian Chancellor, who's now the Foreign Minister, His Excellency Schallenberg, in October 2021 on the sidelines of COP26 in Glasgow. \"The last prime ministerial visit from India to Austria took place more than 40 years ago,\" the foreign secretary said. Modi during his visit will call on the President of Austria and \"hold restricted delegation-level talks as also a high-level business engagement in Austria\" besides having an interaction with the Indian community in Vienna. Kwatra said Austria offers \"excellent opportunities\" for bilateral cooperation in infrastructure, renewable energy, high technology areas, start-up sectors, media and entertainment. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had visited Austria from December 31, 2022, to January 3, 2023. During the visit, he had met with Austrian Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen, Chancellor Karl Nehammer and President of the National Counci, Wolfgang Sobotka. He held delegation-level talks with the Austrian Foreign Minister, Alexander Schallenberg. Five agreements were also signed during the visit, according to the bilateral relations profile dated June 2023. During Austrian Foreign Minister Schallenberg's visit to India in 2022, both ministers had discussed the \"entire gamut of bilateral relations, including political, economic, commercial and consular ties\". Ahead of his visit to Austria, Prime Minister Modi on Sunday said the shared values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law form the bedrock upon which the two countries will build an ever-closer partnership. Modi's remark came a day after Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer posted on 'X', \"I very much look forward to welcoming Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, the world's largest democracy, next week in Vienna.\" \"This visit is a special honour as it marks the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister in over 40 years and a significant milestone as we celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations with India,\" he said. \"We will have the opportunity to talk about further deepening our bilateral relationship and closer cooperation on the many geopolitical challenges,\" the Austrian chancellor said. Responding to Nehammer, Modi said, \"Thank you, Chancellor Karl Nehammer. It is indeed an honour to visit Austria to mark this historic occasion. \"I look forward to our discussions on strengthening the bonds between our nations and exploring new avenues of cooperation.\" Austria is known for its rich cultural and architectural heritage with Vienna renowned for its legacy of orchestral music and legendary composers. \"The visit of India's philosopher-poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore twice to Vienna -- in 1921 and 1926 -- was one of the crucial bridges of cultural and intellectual exchange between India and Austria,\" the MEA website said.",

            "articleBody": "LITTLETON: Europe's top coal-fired electricity producer cleaned up its power generation act during the first half of 2024, lifting clean electricity generation by more than 25 per cent from the first half of 2024 and cutting fossil fuel-fired output by 9 per cent. Clean power also registered its highest ever share of Turkey's generation mix during the January to June period, supplying 53 per cent of all electricity compared to 44 per cent for the same months in 2023, data from energy think tank Ember shows. Turkey's overall electricity output also climbed, rising by nearly 7 per cent from a year ago to its highest in at least six years, ensuring that total electricity supplies for households and businesses has expanded despite cuts to fossil fuel use. That expansion in total generation contrasts with generation trends across Europe as a whole, where total electricity output remains below prior peaks in several countries due to subdued demand from industry and greater regional energy efficiency.  UNDER PRESSURE Higher overall Turkish electricity generation should start to put pressure on Turkish electricity prices, which remain sharply above long-term average levels since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 roiled regional power markets. Power producers have been under pressure in Turkey to boost total output and cut electricity prices to support economic activity. Turkey's manufacturing sector has struggled with weak orders due to soft regional demand for the goods that Turkey produces and high manufacturing costs due to the country's elevated energy prices. To boost output, power firms have relied on coal to provide a majority of the country's electricity, and so far in 2024 have generated more electricity from coal than Germany and Poland, Europe's next largest coal-fired power producers. But through the first half of 2024 Turkey's power firms have actually been able to cut coal's share of the national generation mix to make way for more clean power output. HYDRO HELP Hydro dams have been the main source of Turkey's clean power this year, with output rising by 37 per cent from the same period in 2023 to the highest since 2020. Increased hydro dam capacity along with heavy rains this spring have fuelled the growth in hydro generation this year. Output from wind and solar farms have also registered double-digit growth during the first half of 2024. Wind generation was a record 17.58 TWh during January through June, while solar output was an all-time high 11.75 TWh, Ember data shows. Coal-fired generation has remained largely flat so far in 2024, at 53.6 TWh. However, gas-fired output has contracted by 26 per cent to the lowest in four years. In turn, that decline in total fossil fuel-fired generation has reduced Turkey's power sector emissions, which fell by 5 per cent to 68.3 million metric tons during the first half from the same months last year.  IMPORT IMPACT Lower overall electricity generation from fossil fuels has meant that Turkey's import needs for power generation fuels also dropped during the first half of the year. Thermal coal purchases contracted by 5 per cent over the first half of 2024 from the first half of 2023 to 9.5 million metric tons, according to ship tracing data from Kpler. Turkey's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) dropped by 28 per cent during the first half of the year to 13.6 million tons, and the lowest for the first half of the year since 2019.  TURNING HIGHER? Turkey's purchases and use of fossil fuels will likely turn higher over the coming months due to the seasonal tendency for hydro power generation to decline sharply from July onwards due to lower rainfall. To make up for that decline in such a key source of clean energy, power firms will likely need to lift generation from coal-fired plants to ensure round-the-clock electricity supplies. In 2023, July and August marked the highest months for coal-fired generation in Turkey that year, just as hydro generation started to fall sharply from its highs during the spring months. In 2024, coal generation trends could well follow the same path and climb during the peak summer months. However, the total coal generation growth may be limited by higher output from solar farms during the sunniest months of the year. And if wind farms can repeat the strong performance seen during last two summers - when output peaked from July through September - Turkey's power firms may be able to keep overall fossil generation in check, and keep clean energy as the primary source of the country's electricity.By Gavin Maguire",

            "articleBody": "India is at the forefront of the global fight against climate change, committing to ambitious climate targets emphasising sustainable energy use as a cornerstone of environmental and economic resilience. The country's pledge to reduce carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2070 underscores this commitment.  Energy consumption is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, as more than 75 per cent of India's energy is still sourced from fossil fuels. Without strategic changes, consumption is projected to escalate rapidly with growing urbanisation, industrialisation, and population. Recognising that efficient use of energy can contribute to 40 per cent of the emissions savings goal, India has actively committed to doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Given these monumental goals, tracking progress becomes imperative. Building a future powered by efficient energy use demands a multi-pronged approach, with states as key players. Due to distinctive challenges at the state-level and the considerable influence of sub-national bodies, strong local governance and improved institutional capacities are essential. A data-driven approach offers a crucial pathway to uncover hidden inefficiencies, understand consumption patterns, and identify areas with the highest potential for impact. This approach enables the formulation of tailored energy conservation strategies and the implementation of effective energy efficiency programmes. Building a Robust Data Infrastructure At the heart of a data-driven energy strategy lies the imperative to build a robust data infrastructure. This involves standardising data collection methods across the board and investing in state-level energy databases that can capture, store, and analyse energy consumption data with precision. Without reliable and comprehensive data, it is hard to plan and implement energy efficiency strategies.  The Indian government has intensified efforts to streamline energy data collection and analysis over the past few years. The annual State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI), developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in association with the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE), exemplifies the strides made towards institutionalising data capture, monitoring, and tracking at the state and local levels. Another pivotal move involves the establishment of the Energy Data Management Unit (EDMU) within BEE, aimed at compiling and publishing reliable data on energy supply and consumption across all sectors. Complementing this initiative, NITI Aayog launched the India Climate and Energy Dashboard (ICED) 3.0, offering centralised access to near real-time data on energy, climate, and economic indicators. Additionally, the updated India Energy Security Scenarios (IESS) 2047 (v3.0) includes considerations of emissions, costs, land, and water to support future planning. These combined efforts provide a powerful foundation for informed decision-making.However,there is a persisting gap in capturing accurate and granular information on end-use energy consumption, which is much harder to capture than supply-side energy data. Prioritising delivered energy data and setting up rigorous processes to collect it would empower policymakers to craft targeted efficiency strategies and reduce overall consumption. Additionally, insights into final consumption patterns across sectors enable more precise policy interventions. Leveraging Technology for Enhanced Energy Management Effective energy planning and savings require systems that measure and monitor usage at the point of consumption, ideally down to individual appliances. Technological advancements and rising demand have led to cost-effective, IoT-enabled building energy measurement systems, facilitating a data-driven approach to optimise energy efficiency. These systems track consumption and costs, providing facility managers with real-time insights to improve energy use through smarter consumption and the implementation of energy-efficient technologies and designs.  Drawing inspiration from the likes of the Haryana Renewable Energy Development Agency (HAREDA), Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd (KREDL), and Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) &mdash; all of which have made significant strides in energy savings through the adoption of energy-efficient architecture (green buildings) and the utilisation of high-efficiency appliances &mdash; State Designated Agencies (SDAs) have the opportunity to exemplify energy management. This can be achieved by the meticulous installation and operation of energy management systems, thereby setting a standard for others to follow.  Data for Development A robust data infrastructure is crucial, forming the foundation for informed decision-making at all levels. Quantification is key throughout this process. Data is needed for setting realistic targets, tracking progress, and measuring impact.A data-driven approach should permeate every step &ndash; from crafting policies to implementation, monitoring progress, and evaluating real-world results. India has taken commendable steps towards &lsquo;walking the talk.&rsquo; During its G20 presidency, the focus on &lsquo;data for development&rsquo; highlighted the growing consensus: high-quality data is the backbone of meaningful policymaking, efficient resource allocation, and effective public service delivery. The emphasis on data-driven decision-making is a clarion call to intensify our efforts in the energy space. Innovation and investment in energy efficiency solutions are key, not just for achieving climate goals but for building a future where sustainable energy consumption is the cornerstone of development.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: US short-seller Hindenburg Research had shared an advance copy of its damning report against Adani group with New York-based hedge fund manager Mark Kingdon about two months before publishing it and profited from a deal to share spoils from share price movement, according to market regulator Sebi. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), in its 46-page show cause notice to Hindenburg, detailed how the US short seller, the New York hedge fund and a broker tied to Kotak Mahindra Bank benefited from the over USD 150 billion routs in the market value of Adani group's 10 listed firms post-publication of the report. Sebi charged Hindenburg of making \"unfair\" profits from \"collusion\" to use \"non-public\" and \"misleading\" information and induce \"panic selling\" in Adani Group stocks. Hindenburg, which made public the Sebi notice, in its response, has described the show cause as an attempt to \"silence and intimidate those who expose corruption and fraud perpetrated by the most powerful individuals in India\" and revealed that the vehicle used to bet against Adani's flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd belonged to Kotak Mahindra (International) Ltd, a Mauritius-based subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. KMIL's fund placed bets on Adani Enterprises Ltd for its client Kingdon's Kingdon Capital Management. Sebi notice includes extracts of time-stamped chats between an employee of the hedge fund and KMIL traders for selling future contracts in AEL. Kotak Mahindra Bank has stated that Kingdon \"never disclosed that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price-sensitive information\". Sebi -- which last year told a Supreme Court-appointed panel that it was investigating 13 opaque offshore entities that held between 14 per cent and 20 per cent across five publicly traded stocks of the Adani group -- has sent notices not just to Hindenburg but also to KMIL, Kingdon and Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson. Senior lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani, who had in the past spoken for the Adani group, in a post on X claimed that Kingdon had a Chinese link. Kingdon is married to \"Chinese spy\" Anla Cheng, he claimed. \"Accomplished Chinese spy Anla Cheng, who along with her husband Mark Kingdon, hired Hindenburg for a research report on Adani, engaged the services of Kotak to facilitate a trading account to short sell Adani shares; made millions of dollars from their short selling; eroded Adani market cap enormously,\" he alleged. Kingdon, which had a controlling stake in KMIL's K-India Opportunities Fund Ltd, had a pact to share with Hindenburg 30 per cent of profit made from trading in securities based on the report, the Sebi letter said, adding this profit share was cut to 25 per cent due to the extra time and effort needed to reroute trades via the K India fund. The market regulator said Kingdon transferred USD 43 million in two tranches to build short positions in AEL. The K India fund built short positions for 8,50,000 shares ahead of the report release and squared off these positions soon after the report was released. According to Sebi, Hindenburg published a report titled 'Adani Group: How the World's 3rd Richest Man is Pulling The Largest Con in Corporate History' on January 24, 2023 (United States time - January 25, 2023, according to IST) during pre-market hours. \"Prior to the release of the Hindenburg Report, concentration in short-selling activity was observed in the derivatives of Adani Enterprises Ltd,\" it said. \"Pursuant to the release of the said report, the price of AEL fell by around 59 per cent during the period from January 24, 2023 to February 22, 2023\" -- from Rs 3,422 to Rs 14,04.85 per share. Sebi said K India Opportunities Fund Ltd - Class F (KIOF Class F) opened a trading account and started trading in the scrip of AEL just a few days prior to the publication of the report and then squared off its entire short position post-publication of the Hindenburg Report, making significant profits of Rs 183.23 crore (USD 22.25 million). \"The net profit after trading and legal expenses comes to USD 22.11 million,\" Sebi said. As part of the deal, Kingdon owned Hindenburg USD 5.5 million, of which USD 4.1 million had been paid as of June 1, the notice said. In its response to Sebi, Kingdon Capital said it had got legal option that it could \"enter into a research services agreement with a third-party firm that publicly releases short reports on companies, pursuant to which Kingdon Capital would be given a draft copy of the report before it is made publicly available and would have the opportunity to accordingly made investments before the report's public dissemination\". A show-cause notice is often a precursor to formal legal action that may include imposing financial penalties and barring participation in the Indian capital market. Sebi can also seek government help to geoblock the research firm's website. Sebi has given Hindenburg 21 days to respond to its allegations. Hindenburg, which published the Sebi notice on its website, in its response stated that it made just USD 4.1 million from its declared positions on Adani stocks and criticised the regulator for not focusing its investigation into the January 2023 report \"providing evidence\" of the conglomerate creating \"a vast network of offshore shell entities\" and moving billions of dollars \"surreptitiously\" into and out of Adani public and private entities. It said that while Sebi was seeking to claim jurisdiction over a US-based investor, the regulator's notice \"conspicuously failed to name the party that has an actual tie to India: Kotak Bank,\" which created and oversaw the offshore fund structure used by Hindenburg's investor partner to bet against Adani. The regulator \"masked the \"Kotak\" name with the acronym \"KMIL\", it added. KMIL refers to Kotak Mahindra Investments Ltd, the asset management company.",

Sharif's remarks came as he chaired a review meeting in Islamabad on Saturday on the implementation of agreements and MOUs reached during his recent visit to China, Radio Pakistan reported.  The prime minister said that the promotion of Pakistan-China cooperation in these fields will lead to economic development, strengthening of regional ties, and deepening of the relations between the two countries.  Referring to the time-tested Pak-China friendship, he said that China had always supported Pakistan in difficult times. \"China has emerged as the strongest economic power and Pakistan can emulate its development,\" he added.  The 72-year-old Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader said that no disruption will be tolerated in the implementation of agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) signed during his visit to China, announcing to personally monitor the implementation of these agreements and MoUs.  The prime minister was also briefed about a delegation of Chinese shoemaking companies recently visiting Pakistan to shift their manufacturing units to the cash-strapped country and that the Chinese companies have the potential to invest USD 5-8 billion in this sector.  Regarding the agriculture sector, he was apprised that 12 leading companies of China will participate in the Food and Agri Expo to be held in Pakistan this year.  Sharif also reviewed the progress regarding sending 1,000 students from Pakistan to China on government scholarships for advanced training in the agriculture sector.  He directed that students from all four provinces, including Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), should be sent to China on the basis of merit, while students from backward areas of Balochistan should be given special priority in the programme.  Sharif instructed to start sending students for modern agricultural training in China from the next academic semester.  Besides, the meeting was told that over 100 Chinese companies are in contact with Pakistani companies for business and investment.  The meeting was also briefed about the progress on the technical training of 3,00,000 students by Huawei, a one-stop operation to facilitate business, smart governance and smart city.  The prime minister was also apprised of the progress made by China on various communication, infrastructure, and electricity projects in Gwadar.  Sharif advised expediting measures for the development of Gwadar Seaport, Gwadar Airport, and Gwadar Industrial Zone to make Gwadar the hub of trade corridor in the region.  He also instructed to speed up the negotiations with Chinese solar panels and equipment manufacturing companies to move their factories to Pakistan.  The 72-year-old leader embarked on his first visit to China after he took over as prime minister for the second term after his PML-N party-led coalition government assumed power in March.  Addressing the Pakistan-China Business Forum last month, Sharif assured all-out facilitation to Chinese investors and the security of Chinese individuals, projects, and investments in Pakistan.  He said his government had taken various measures to ensure fool-proof security to protect the lives of Chinese workers in Pakistan.  Five Chinese nationals and a Pakistan driver were killed in a suicide attack in Dasu in March. Pakistan paid USD 2.58 million as compensation to the families of those killed in the attack.",

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: Two months since the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) was reinstated, the challenges of availability and affordability of solar modules continue to persist, according to industry stakeholders.&ldquo;It has been two months of ALMM reversal, and the challenges of availability and affordability continue to persist. On an average, the cost for N-type DCR modules in the domestic market is about Rs 22 per Wp (watt peak) for a module size of 545-550 Wp. and non-DCR modules that use Chinese cells cost about Rs 15,&rdquo; Sarthak Sengupta, Head, Procurement, Amplus Solar told ETEnergyWorld. He said that imported modules, meanwhile, even after adding 44 per cent basic customs duty and surcharge, were priced at Rs 12 on average whereas the availability and affordability of N-Type/Topcon modules is even more challenging. According to Ashish Agarwal, head &ndash; solar business, BluPine Energy, it is too early to comment definitively on the impact of the ALMM restoration on domestic supply and pricing, as the deadline expired two months ago. &ldquo;However, within these two months, we have observed a significant increase in the number of orders received by domestic module manufacturers. There is already chatter among suppliers that if future capacities are not blocked soon, they may not be able to deliver on time as their factories are getting fully booked,&rdquo; he added.The government reinstated the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) effective from 1 April, 2024. The policy applies to all projects except utility projects with power purchase agreements signed before July 2021 and behind-the-meter projects.With the reinstatement of ALMM, the solar power developers are required to source modules from domestic manufacturers registered under ALMM. According to Vikram V, vice-president, co-group head - corporate ratings, ICRA, the cost of sourcing modules from domestic OEMs using imported solar PV cells is expected to be about Rs 19-20 cents per Watt. &ldquo;This remains relatively high compared to the cost of imported modules at 15 cents/watt (after accounting for the import duty). Nonetheless, the viability of solar power projects using modules from domestic OEMs remains adequate considering the prevailing bid tariff of Rs 2.5-2.7 per unit,&rdquo; added Vikram.Apart from the increase in project costs due to this, there is a direct impact on working capital cost due to the unavailability of modules in the domestic market, added Amplus Solar&rsquo;s Sengupta.&ldquo;Suppliers are unwilling to commit more than 20-25 MW of modules at a time and that assurance is also yet to be practically tested. When larger projects demand 200-300 MW of modules, we are forced to source from three to four different suppliers and endure long wait times for availability. This not only escalates project costs but also impacts the project timelines,&rdquo; he said.He added that at present, the challenges with availability of cost competitive higher efficiency solar modules under the ALMM regime is likely to have an adverse impact on the growth plans of solar based renewable capacities, particularly in the C&amp;I segment. BluPine Energy&rsquo;s Agarwal said that compared to Chinese manufacturers, the performance of domestic OEMs is not at par and they do lack in certain areas such as manufacturing processes, and quality control still, they are not too far behind. He added that as far as module manufacturing is concerned, there are no significant capability issues. He said that the ecosystem in India has been existing for almost 20 to 30 years now with companies such as BHEL, BEL, manufacturing modules for nearly two decades. &ldquo;Even private sector players have been in the business for over 10 to 15 years. So, I don't see any major challenges here. But, the volumes are not that high, and there are teething issues with the processes, but these will get sorted out as the market picks up,&rdquo; he said.A lot of Indian manufacturers are not only supplying to India but also exporting to European and American markets. By 2023, India exported modules worth $1.8 billion. Despite a rush by Indian developers to buy modules from China, Indian module manufacturers still managed to export $1.8 billion worth of modules offsite, reflecting their quality and capability, he added.Ashish Kumar Saxena, chief procurement officer, AMPIN Energy Transition, said that there is still a significant gap between module and solar cell production, necessitating continued reliance on imports from China for solar cells. While most Bill of Materials (BOM) for manufacturing are also imported from China, driven by pricing and quality considerations.&ldquo;Despite using the same raw materials, the tolling and conversion costs from cell to module in India are still high. This results in domestically produced modules being 7 per cent to 8 per cent more expensive than imported ones,&rdquo; said Saxena.He said that most OEMs in India were currently producing P-type PERC modules, with N-type modules still in the stabilization phase. &ldquo;Indian OEMs are facing challenges in meeting global quality standards, as ongoing process improvements are needed to match international benchmarks,&rdquo; he said.Tier-1 solar photovoltaic manufacturers such as China&rsquo;s Longi and Jinko, have shown interest in establishing manufacturing operations in India.&ldquo;Substantial quantity addition is needed to close the huge demand-supply gap in domestic production remains a considerable challenge, and achieving the necessary scale and stabilization of the same to international standard without charging unrealistic premium appears to be a distant goal, especially for the rooftop segment,&rdquo; said Sengupta.The government continues to support efforts to enhance domestic manufacturing capabilities. However, this support should not hinder yearly renewable energy capacity addition targets, he added. &ldquo;Until domestic manufacturing meets expected standards and can produce advanced modules, we must re-evaluate the restoration of the ALMM, at least for the private PPA market where the consumers are struggling with space constraints and cost competencies,&rdquo; he said.BluPine Energy&rsquo;s Agarwal said that in preparation for the ALMM, the company started procuring domestic modules last year. &ldquo;Although there were some issues with the first few batches, the supply has become quite consistent since then. We no longer face any quality or supply challenges from domestic OEMs. So, we hope that as manufacturing picks up, this problem will disappear,&rdquo; he added.According to a government press release dated 5 February 2024, the installed solar module manufacturing capacity in the country is about 50 GW. While the installed solar cell manufacturing capacity is about 6 GW. It added that $11,171 million of solar cells and modules have been imported into the country in the last five years, which is about 0.4 per cent of total India&rsquo;s merchandise imports during the same period.",

            "articleBody": "Gujarat has attracted a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of USD 7.3 billion in the financial year 2023-24, a jump of 55 per cent over the previous fiscal, the state government said in a release on Friday. With this, Gujarat now occupies the second spot in the country after Maharashtra in terms of the FDI inflow, it said. Citing the data released by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the state government said Gujarat has topped the charts in the annual increase in FDI inflow during 2023-24 by recording a jump of USD 2.6 billion. \"Registering a 55 per cent increase in the FDI inflow during FY 2023-24 as compared to the inflow during FY 2022-23, Gujarat received a whopping USD 7.3 billion in FY 2023-24 as compared to the USD 4.7 billion received in the FY 2022-23. With the FDI inflow of USD 7.3 billion, Gujarat moved ahead of Karnataka and Delhi to reach the second spot in the country,\" said the release. With a total FDI inflow of USD 15.1 billion in 2024, Maharashtra occupies the top spot followed by Gujarat with USD 7.3 billion. Karnataka, Delhi and Telangana are on the third, fourth and fifth spots respectively with the FDI inflows of USD 6.6 billion, USD 6.5 billion and USD 3 billion. Aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of Viksit Bharat, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel has enacted numerous industry-friendly policies and decisions, leading to significant positive outcomes in the state, said the release. Gujarat has shown a consistent growth in attracting FDI for three consecutive financial years by securing investments of USD 2.7 billion in FY2022, USD 4.7 billion in FY2023 and USD 7.3 billion in FY2024. Speaking about Gujarat's performance in attracting the FDI inflow, state Industries Minister Balvantsinh Rajput said CM Patel is ensuring that every possible mechanism that facilitates investment and business is in place, ranging from state-of-the-art industrial infrastructure to business-friendly government policies. Among the major factors that have played a role in attracting FDI are Gujarat's state-of-the-art industrial infrastructure, industry-friendly policies, and consistent enhancement in ease of doing business, the release said. Cluster-based industrial regions, such as GIFT City, Sanand GIDC, Dholera SIR (Special Investment Region) and Mandal Becharaji SIR also play a significant role in attracting the investors, it said, adding that marquee projects such as multiple semiconductor manufacturing plants have also played a huge role in attracting foreign investment. Launch and effective implementation of new sector-specific policies in areas such as renewable energy, semiconductor, and information technology (IT) in the last three years have also created a favourable investment climate. Moreover, financial incentives to entrepreneurs and small industries setting up base in Gujarat, expedited allotment of land, power connection and other business-friendly measures have also played a prominent role in bringing new investment.",

            "articleBody": "Kolkata: Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) on Friday announced that it has planned to invest Rs 20,000 crore by 2030 to install nearly 4,000 MW of solar capacity, a top official said. The corporation, created for flood control and development in the Damodar Valley, envisions investment worth Rs 50,000-60,000 crore by 2030 to enhance thermal, pump storage power plants and solar energy, he said. It aims at adding nearly 10,000 MW in thermal and green energy, which will bring its total installed capacity to about 16,700 MW. Of the current 6,700 MW installed capacity of DVC, 6,540 MW is thermal. \"Power demand is growing strong in the north, south, and western parts of the country. We are expanding sustainably with the right mix of thermal and renewable energy, which will keep power costs affordable. We will add 3,720 MW in thermal capacity and nearly 4,000 MW in solar by 2030,\" DVC Chairman S. Suresh Kumar said during an interaction on the occasion of the 77th Foundation Day of the corporation. The Kolkata-headquartered corporation now has only 14 MW installed solar capacity and is executing a 348 MW project in association with NTPC. A 250MW/hour capacity of battery storage is also under consideration, he said. Kumar mentioned that DVC has been exempted from coal import due to its power plants' proximity to the pithead. Recently, the Union Power Ministry has extended a coal import advisory to domestic thermal plants for 4 per cent blending till October 15 to ensure adequate fuel supply during the monsoon season. DVC also plans to ramp up its captive coal mining from its Tubed block in Jharkhand with a separate railway siding for smoother evacuation. \"With the dedicated railway siding for loading, we will be able to ramp up production to six million tonnes. We have proposed to the Railways that we would set up the facility at our cost. Due to current evacuation bottlenecks, our output is below two million tonnes. Captive coal is already cheaper, and if Coal India revises the price further, our coal becomes extremely affordable,\" Kumar said. The maximum annual production can reach up to nine million tonnes, he said. \"The current coal requirement of DVC is 28-30 million tonnes,\" Kumar added. The rest of the coal demand is met from the supplies by Coal India subsidiaries. The corporation is unable to bid for a new coal block due to legal hurdles regarding a legacy case, involving a past joint venture with Bengal Emta Coal Mines, the official said. Kumar, who was the former West Bengal power secretary, stated that apart from the 4,000 MW solar power, the corporation plans to install two pump storage facilities in Logu Pahar in Jharkhand (1500 MW) and Panchet in West Bengal (1000 MW). The Panchet project is proposed to be a JV with the West Bengal government. Speaking about dues from Jharkhand, the DVC official said the old dues have come down to about Rs 1,000 crore, and the state is clearing the same.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The ministry of new &amp; renewable energy has released revised guidelines for the development of onshore wind power projects, particularly updating the micrositing criteria to optimize energy production. This amendment, dated July 4, 2024, introduces refined placement and spacing standards for wind turbines to maximize energy efficiency across wind farms.Under the new guidelines, developers are required to utilize sophisticated wind flow modeling and optimization techniques to adhere to the IEC 61400-1 standard, which governs wind turbine safety under various environmental influences. The criteria stipulate maintaining a minimum distance of five times the rotor diameter (5D) from turbines in the direction of prevailing winds and seven times (7D) perpendicularly, based on the largest turbine's rotor diameter involved.Additionally, the guidelines mandate a buffer of the rotor's diameter plus five meters from public roads and critical infrastructure, aiming to safeguard both the infrastructure and the operational integrity of the wind turbines. To address noise concerns, turbines must not be placed within 500 meters of any residential clusters, defined as areas having at least 15 inhabited buildings unless specified otherwise by state regulations.These modifications are designed to not only improve the output of wind energy projects but also support repowering and intercropping, thus ensuring optimized land use without significant restrictions on turbine placement. The update, now in effect, is expected to influence a wide range of stakeholders within India's growing renewable energy sector.",

            "articleBody": "BERLIN: Germany could cover up to 100 terawatt-hours (TWh) of its annual energy needs with imports of green hydrogen via pipelines from neighbouring countries by the mid-2030s, covering a significant share of its projected demand, a study showed on Thursday. Berlin is seeking to expand the use of hydrogen as an energy source to cut greenhouse emissions for highly polluting industrial sectors that cannot be electrified, such as steel and chemicals, and cut dependency on imported fossil fuel. Produced using solar and wind power, green hydrogen is a pillar of Germany's planned energy transition, The study by Berlin-based Agora Energiewende and Agora Industry think tanks said that by 2035 hydrogen could cover 11.2% of the country's projected 894 TWh total energy demand. But Germany will need to import around 50% to 70% of its hydrogen due to its limited renewable energy resources. Currently, Germany uses around 55-60 TWh of hydrogen per year but it is produced almost exclusively from fossil fuels, data by the economy ministry showed. The study said that by 2030 Germany could produce 11 TWh of hydrogen and import about 17 TWh of green and some 15 TWh of blue hydrogen, produced from natural gas, via pipelines. That would cover less than half of Germany's total hydrogen demand projected to reach 95 TWh to 130 TWh by the end of the decade. However, by leveraging existing natural gas infrastructure in Europe, Germany could boost pipeline imports to between 60 TWh and 100 TWh by 2035, the study said. \"To achieve climate neutrality, Germany needs a secure and cost-effective supply of renewable hydrogen. Pipeline imports from Europe play a crucial role in this,\" Simon Mueller, Agora Energiewende director, said in statement. To reach this imports potential, Germany will need a financing model and will have to move quickly with agreements on cost-sharing among involved countries, Mueller said. \"This is the only way the required quantities of green hydrogen can be delivered in the first half of the next decade,\" he said. Hydrogen producers and pipeline operators will also need assurances about future hydrogen demand from Germany, Mueller added. The study examined five potential hydrogen pipeline corridors to Germany, considering factors such as production potential, political support, and technical complexity. Promising corridors include imports from Denmark and Norway via the North Sea, and potentially from Sweden and Finland via the Baltic Sea in a later stage due to the distance and technical complexity, it added. In the long term, pipelines from Southern Europe and North Africa, especially Spain and Tunisia, can play a significant role, in addition to possible imports from the United Kingdom, Portugal, Algeria, Greece, and Ukraine.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: JSW Energy, under the leadership of Chairman and Managing Director Sajjan Jindal, is poised to significantly enhance its power generation and storage capabilities, earmarking a substantial capital expenditure (capex) of &#8377;1,15,000 crore to achieve a 20 GW generation target and 40 GWh storage capacity by 2030.In the fiscal year 2024, JSW Energy marked a significant stride in its expansion plan, adding 680 MW of greenfield capacity. This addition has propelled the company&rsquo;s net generation up by 27% year-on-year to 27.9 billion units. Subsequently, the total revenue of the company saw a 10% increase year-on-year, reaching &#8377;11,941 crore. Notably, the EBITDA for the fiscal stood at &#8377;5,837 crore, marking a 53% increase from the previous year, fueled by new additions to the renewable energy asset base and a robust performance from the thermal business.For the upcoming fiscal year 2025, JSW Energy has planned an ambitious capex of &#8377;15,000 crore. \"Your company intends to spend around &#8377;15,000 crore in the current fiscal year as we accelerate our ambitions. Additionally, we are also actively scouting for acquisition opportunities in the power sector,\" said Jindal addressing the stakeholders at the AGM.Amidst a robust project pipeline, JSW Energy achieved a significant milestone by securing 3.4 GW of renewable energy projects through competitive bidding. Additionally, the current year has seen the addition of a pipeline of 600 MW, culminating in a total locked-in capacity of 13.9 GW, representing a remarkable 42% increase compared to the previous fiscal year.The recent fiscal developments included the successful synchronization of the Ind-Barath Unit 1, with a capacity of 350 MW. The second unit of similar capacity is expected to be synchronized within this quarter, underscoring the company&rsquo;s efficient project execution capabilities.In a strategic move to bolster its financial strength for these ambitious projects, JSW Energy successfully raised &#8377;5,000 crore through a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in April 2024. This fundraising was the largest QIP in the power sector and marked the company&rsquo;s first equity raise since its IPO 14 years ago. The issue was subscribed over 3.2 times, attracting significant interest from high-quality global and domestic institutional investors.As JSW Energy continues to diversify its operations, it is also making significant advancements in energy products and services. The company has begun construction of its first Green Hydrogen plant and secured a substantial 6,500 tonnes per annum production capacity under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) program.Sajjan Jindal expressed optimism about the company's strategic direction: \"Your company&rsquo;s proactive approach is on capitalizing growth opportunities within the energy sector, ensuring energy security, and supporting India&rsquo;s decarbonization goals. This is aimed at presenting us as a return-focused, forward-thinking, resilient, and innovative company ready for future opportunities while accelerating current growth momentum.\"JSW Energy's aggressive investment and strategic expansions are set to significantly contribute to India&rsquo;s sustainable energy goals, positioning the company as a leader in the transition towards renewable energy and energy security.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a forecast that could resonate well with the burgeoning green energy sector, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has projected that base metal prices will continue their upward trajectory in FY25, driven by an accelerating global shift towards sustainable energy and moderate demand growth from China. Coupled with potential supply disruptions, these factors have led Ind-Ra to maintain a neutral outlook on the base metals sector for the upcoming fiscal year. Shradha Saraogi Garg, Associate Director, India Ratings, said, \"While the continued sluggish global economic demand growth may dampen overall consumption growth, the strong continued pull from green energy is likely to limit downsides over the medium term, especially in the domestic market.\"Profitability within the sector is likely to improve in FY25 due to sustained high metal prices and continued cost rationalization efforts by metal producers, which are expected to lead to better spreads. However, Ind-Ra also warns of potential near-term downside risks to margins, which could stem from likely production disruptions and rebalancing of supply chains.Focusing on specific metals, Ind-Ra projects that copper prices will remain elevated in FY25, supported by growing investments in renewable power generation and electric vehicles. Although India will continue to be a net importer of copper, the domestic supply deficit is expected to improve after March 2024 when the Adani group&rsquo;s new copper smelting capacity becomes operational. The agency anticipates that the Treatment and Refining Charges (TC/RC) for copper will moderate year-over-year.For zinc, Ind-Ra expects the prices to stabilize around USD 2,500 per tonne in FY25. This stability is limited by an ongoing excess supply and modest demand growth in China, coupled with a subdued growth outlook for major economies. However, positive demand prospects in India, particularly from the auto sector and industrial capital expenditures, are expected to boost domestic zinc consumption.The outlook for aluminium is also positive with an expected year-on-year price increase in FY25, attributed to supply tightness and a weaker dollar. Despite this, the global aluminium market is forecasted to remain in surplus, as absolute production is anticipated to outpace consumption.On the coal front, Ind-Ra predicts that domestic coal availability will continue to improve in FY25, driven by the operationalization and ramp-up of commercially auctioned coal mines and enhancements in the efficiency and capacities of existing operational mines. The agency notes that the government's efforts to reduce imports of substitutable coal and planned additional infrastructure to support coal-based power plants will likely result in a gradual reduction in the share of imports in overall coal consumption.Overall, Ind-Ra's stable rating outlook for rated entities in the sector reflects expectations of healthy credit profiles in FY25, supported by stable cash generation. Despite anticipated continued negative free cash flow due to sustained high capital expenditure plans, key rated entities are expected to maintain adequate liquidity and benefit from strong financial flexibility and access to capital markets. Those with integrated operations, low-cost positions, and dominant market shares are considered better equipped to face potential industry headwinds.",

            "articleBody": "Beijing: The European Union will impose additional provisional duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese electric cars from Friday after concluding manufacturers in China benefited from unfair state support.Here's why the Chinese electric vehicle market has raised hackles among European policymakers -- and what impact the move could have:- How did China's EV sector get so strong? -China has spearheaded a targeted industrial strategy to boost its EV sector, pouring vast state funds into domestic firms as well as research and development.Between 2014 and the end of 2022, the Chinese government said it had spent more than 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) on subsidies and tax breaks for EV purchases alone.The approach has given Chinese firms a critical edge in the race to provide cheaper, more efficient EVs over leading European automakers, which have not always enjoyed such state largesse.They have also been boosted by surging domestic demand: Of all new EVs sold globally in December last year, 69 percent were in China, according to the research firm Rystad Energy.Exports are soaring. According to the Atlantic Council, Chinese sales of EVs abroad rose 70 percent in 2023, reaching $34.1 billion.Almost 40 percent went to the European Union, the largest recipient of Chinese EVs.The EU market share of Chinese-made EVs climbed from around three percent to more than 20 percent in the past three years, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.- Who are the key players? -The overwhelming market leader from China is BYD, which this year posted record annual profits for 2023 and says it aims to be among the top five car companies in Europe.Last year, it became the first manufacturer to pass the five million milestone in terms of hybrids and all-electric vehicles produced, cumulatively -- crowning itself as \"the world's leading manufacturer of new energy vehicles\".Among the other top Chinese EV makers exporting to Europe are SAIC, MG Motor and Polestar -- owned by Volvo and its Chinese parent firm Geely -- according to state media.- Why is the EU worried? -The surge in exports has allowed Chinese firms to rapidly increase their share of the EU market for EVs.The EU has now concluded that Chinese manufacturers benefited from \"unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury\" to European automakers.But there is also dissent within the EU -- Germany, a major trade partner whose car market is heavily reliant on China, warned tariffs would harm German companies.The EU will now impose provisional duties between 20 and 38 percent on top of the current 10 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars.Definitive duties will take effect in November for a period of five years, pending a vote by the EU's 27 states.- How has Beijing reacted? -Beijing has yet to react but a Chinese trade group condemned the bloc's \"protectionism\".China has already bared its teeth however, kickstarting an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports from the EU, threatening Spanish exports.In January, China launched an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the EU, in a move seen as targeting France, which had pushed for the commission's probe.Beijing said in June it \"reserves the right\" to file a case with the World Trade Organization over the EU tariffs.- How have car manufacturers reacted? -Since the EU's move will impact all Chinese-made electric cars, Tesla's Model 3, the electric Mini, and the Volvo EX40 are also among the vehicles that will face higher duties.A Tesla spokesperson said prices for the Model 3 -- the number three in electric car sales in Europe -- should increase \"in the short term\".China's electric car makers Nio and XPeng told AFP they had no plans to quit the European market after the announcement.Meanwhile, MG France said it already imported 2,600 electric vehicles from China that have cleared customs.- What impact will the tariffs have? -Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, alongside Austrian institutes, predicted the higher taxes will reduce vehicle imports from China by 42 percent.Electric car prices could rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 percent in the EU, they added.Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said costs for Chinese exporters of EVs and EU consumers would increase, and the duties would also hit the bloc's energy conservation and green development goals.",

            "articleBody": "Twice a year, the Reserve Bank of India reviews the stability of the country&rsquo;s financial system. Its latest report made for good headlines: The proportion of loans that have gone sour is at a multiyear low, and likely to decline further.But buried in the report is a warning from the very institutions the central bank is charged with regulating. Market participants responded to a survey asking what they saw as the biggest contributors to systemic risk. While they downplayed the usual concerns &mdash; asset quality, interest rate risk, capital outflows &mdash; one particular threat loomed larger than ever before: climate change. In fact, respondents named it for the first time as the greatest source of systemic risk to the Indian financial system.They&rsquo;re not wrong to worry. It isn&rsquo;t just that India, according to the Network for Greening the Financial System, will see sharply lower growth unless temperature rises are controlled. That growth will be more variable and subject to sharper shocks, including those from weird weather and delayed monsoons. This worries the country&rsquo;s financial arteries; so does the uncertain fate of sectors such as construction, cement and energy, to which they are deeply exposed.Indian regulators have been slow to respond. It wasn&rsquo;t until earlier this year that the RBI finally released a draft framework that would require financial institutions to devise and disclose their strategies to mitigate climate-related risk. Even then, the timeline for adopting the new rules was exceedingly generous. For regular Indian banks, they will only fully come into force for the financial year that ends in March 2028.What explains the lethargy? Part of the problem is no doubt the bureaucratic inertia that bedevils all policymaking in India. Regulators are scared of stepping on each other&rsquo;s toes, and on the government&rsquo;s.Nobody is sure, for example, who will eventually have the last word on what counts as &ldquo;green&rdquo; investment. The securities market regulator moved first to define a taxonomy and a reporting framework for large publicly traded companies. The finance ministry in New Delhi would naturally prefer that any such taxonomy be decided centrally.An inter-departmental task force, with various regulators and ministries represented, is supposedly working on definitions. But it was set up in 2021, and nothing has as yet been decided.At the same time, regulators may be too focused on reinventing the wheel. India&rsquo;s markets are large enough, and its problems pressing enough, that policymakers here generally believe they have little to learn from attempts made elsewhere to solve the same challenges.This is short-sighted, especially when it comes to financial regulation. Whether a taxonomy or disclosure requirements or climate stress tests, transparent criteria that align with those in use elsewhere are helpful &mdash; at least, if you want global investors to understand and trust your standards.Regulators might be more motivated to push through disclosures and restrictions &mdash; such as, for example, tagging specific loans as being at risk in the green transition &mdash; if they thought such transparency would attract greater investment.Unfortunately, Indian policymakers no longer entirely believe promises that a greener financial system will allow the country to access pools of sustainable finance globally. India launched a sovereign green bond in 2023. It didn&rsquo;t sell at much of a premium and was mostly taken up by domestic investors; interest from foreigners seemed low. The RBI canceled the sale of a second tranche scheduled for this year.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there may be an unspoken fear of what a more stringent examination of climate risk might reveal.The RBI released the results of a preliminary set of climate stress tests in 2023. They found that India&rsquo;s vast network of public sector banks was particularly vulnerable.While it&rsquo;s not exactly clear why &mdash; more granular tests have been promised but not conducted yet &mdash; the fact is that many of India&rsquo;s banks have lent heavily in the past to the energy sector. Data from last year showed that banks, even in the public sector, are now balking at financing new coal-fired power plants. That suggests they worry they are overexposed to the sector. (Renewables haven&rsquo;t faced the same problems.)Five years ago, Indian regulators may have been blissfully unaware that climate change posed macro-economic risks. They no longer have that excuse. The very report that identified climate change as a major problem also listed, in exhaustive detail, how other central banks and regulators are responding. The roadmap is there &mdash; India just needs to pick up the pace.",

            "articleBody": "BERLIN: Germany's lower house of parliament has passed legal amendments allowing apartment owners and tenants to install solar systems on their balconies, as the country seeks to increase uptake of the energy form. The reforms, passed late on Thursday, allow what is referred to as a \"privileged measure\" in rental and property ownership law to allow plug-in solar devices, making it difficult for landlords and apartment-owner associations to block their installation without an exceptional justification. \"The right to harvest solar power is thus legally enshrined. This is tangible climate protection and is likely to further increase acceptance of the energy transition,\" Carsten Kornig, the head of the BSW solar power association, said in a statement. The changes are likely to have a particular impact in a country where more than half of the population live in rented accommodation and to help the capital Berlin achieve its goal of covering 80% of energy needs from renewable energy by 2030. They will apply to systems with a capacity of up to 2,000 watts that are frequently used to reduce households electricity bills, the economy ministry said, adding there would be no immediate need to change electricity meters. Following the energy price surge that followed Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the ending of Germany's dependency on Russian gas, Germany has increasingly turned to renewables. Demand for balcony solar systems, which typically cost between 500 and 1,500 euros ($541.25 and $1,623.75), surged last year. Some 550,000 devices are in operation, half of which were installed in 2023, data from the BSW solar power association showed.",

            "articleBody": "BRUSSELS: Hundreds of gigawatts of wind energy projects are waiting for permits to connect to Europe's power grid, a backlog that threatens to slow the shift to green energy, industry association WindEurope said on Friday.  WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Gaining access to the power grid is now the biggest hurdle to Europe's expansion of renewable energy, WindEurope said. With Europe's power networks upgraded too slowly to absorb more capacity, and sluggish grid-permitting procedures in many countries, some projects face waiting times of up to nine years to receive a permit. \"The system is clogged up - and holding back hundreds of gigawatts of wind farms,\" WindEurope CEO Giles Dickson said.  BY THE NUMBERS European wind energy projects with a total of more than 500 gigawatts of potential capacity are waiting for an answer to their requests for grid connections, across countries including France, Germany, Ireland, Poland and Spain, the data published on Friday showed. Italy and the UK each have more than 100 GW of potential projects awaiting grid connection assessments. The EU has a target to derive 42.5% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. That implies expanding wind power capacity to 425 GW by 2030, up from 220 GW today.  WHAT'S NEXT The queue of wind projects is at various stages and not all are likely to be built. For example, some are competing against one another for subsidies, WindEurope said. Part of the problem is that projects are assessed on a \"first come, first served\" basis when they apply, meaning the most mature projects - those most likely to go ahead - cannot jump the queue. Europe's energy industry has urged governments to spur investments in expanding grids to prepare for a bigger influx of renewable power, and filter applications so that projects that are ready to launch receive permits fast.

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: Rows of what look like thin, white shipping containers are lined up on a barren dirt field in China's Shandong province. Filled with batteries, they form a 795 megawatt (MW) plant that can hold up to 1 million kilowatt-hours of electricity - enough to power 150,000 households for a day, making it China's largest such storage facility when it was connected to the grid last Saturday. Built by Lijin County Jinhui New Energy Co, the project is part of an explosion in development of energy storage in China, which has called for even more investment in the sector to boost renewable electricity and ease grid bottlenecks. While the state-led drive has provided a welcome spark for home-grown battery giants such as CATL and BYD, some industry insiders and experts say pricing reforms and technology improvements are needed for a storage sector whose rapid growth has been plagued by low utilisation and losses for operators. \"Most of the players in this sector are trying to figure out how to make money,\" said Rystad Energy senior analyst Simeng Deng. Investment in grid-connected batteries in China surged 364% last year to 75 billion yuan ($11 billion), according to Carbon Brief, creating by far the world's largest storage fleet at 35.3 GW as of March. In May, China set a new target of at least 40GW of battery storage installed by the end of 2025, up 33% from the previous goal under a wider plan to reduce carbon emissions. Storage is critical to help balance supply and demand when wind and solar farms produce more renewable electricity than the grid's distribution system can handle, or when a lack of sun or wind means they are generating too little power. To meet Beijing's targets, local governments have required renewable energy plants to build storage, driving rapid capacity growth. However, highly regulated power markets have struggled to incentivise usage, particularly at solar and wind facilities, leading China's cabinet to call for research into improving price mechanisms. Energy storage at renewables plants operated just 2.18 hours a day last year, while independent facilities operated only 2.61 hours per day, according to the China Electricity Council. By comparison, storage at industrial and commercial plants operated 14.25 hours per day. Policy mandates requiring renewables plants to install storage have failed because they add to project costs and often sit idle, said Cosimo Ries, an analyst at Trivium China. \"Because power prices are not flexible enough during different hours, these projects just can't really make money,\" Ries said.  BIG BUILD The stakes are high for China, which leads the world in adoption of energy transition technology, and for its battery giants, which are seeing faster growth in batteries for storage than for cars as electric vehicle sales growth slows. While government mandates are a key driver of China's storage boom, big power users such as industrial parks and EV charging stations are also driving adoption. China, where 60% of the world's electric vehicles are sold, has worried about the effects of EVs on its power grid, and storage can help smooth demand spikes. Falling battery prices are improving the economics of storage in China, with costs for batteries used in standard energy storage down by about a fifth between the end of 2023 and mid-June, according to consultancy Shanghai Metals Market. Also, expanding adoption of \"peak-valley pricing\", which discourages electricity use during peak demand times by raising prices, gives storage providers more chance to profit by selling stored power when they can charge more. That has led to intraday price differentials of up to 0.9 yuan per kwh in coastal provinces like Guangdong, where the peak price of 1.1868 yuan/kwh is more than four times the low, enough to incentivise use of both battery and pumped hydro storage, said Alex Whitworth, head of Asia Pacific power research at Wood Mackenzie. Pumped hydro is an established technology with more than 60% greater capacity than battery storage in China, but with geographical limitations and long lead times. Investor returns on solar-plus-storage projects are also improving as solar module prices fall, making renewables-plus-storage \"financially feasible in most parts of China\" with internal rates of return meeting the minimum investment hurdle rate of at least 8%, wrote Pierre Lau, a Citi analyst. Further market reform is needed to incentivise battery storage, industry players say, with storage operators calling for wider use of capacity payments similar to those meant to keep struggling coal plants online, with costs shouldered by customers.  BETTER BATTERIES Battery technology is also improving. The vast new Shandong plant incorporates both lithium ion and vanadium redox flow batteries, according to a report by local state media. Vanadium is a newer technology that promises longer storage times and improved safety. While the economics of lithium ion batteries are expected to improve, experts say most current technology is suitable for shorter storage durations of four hours or less, and some say it is best used in smaller-scale applications. Fire risk remains a concern, particularly with lower-quality batteries, experts say. Emerging technologies such as thermal energy storage, redox flow batteries, and sodium ion batteries have shown promise for longer-duration storage but have higher up-front costs, with technology and supply chains that are less mature. China is hedging its bets by increasing its pipeline of pumped hydro projects - which can take five to seven years to build - and encouraging demonstration projects in emerging technologies.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: China's record-breaking deployment of wind and solar capacity has worsened regional power imbalances, forcing the country to idle increasing amounts of renewable generation when it overwhelms local consumption. New government regulations aim to reduce the amount of renewable generation that has to be abandoned by increasing long-distance transmission links and better coordinating generation plans across provinces. Since the end of 2018, China's total generating capacity has increased by 1.137 billion kilowatts (kW), compound annual growth of 9%, according to data from the National Bureau of statistics (NBS). Thermal capacity, mainly from coal-fired plants but some from gas-fired generators, rose by 257 million kW or 4% per year (\"China statistical yearbook\", NBS, 2023). Most capacity additions, however, have come from what the government calls \"new energy sources\" - wind farms (277 million kW, 19% per year) and solar generators (517 million kW, 29% per year). Increased penetration of intermittent renewables is making it harder to manage a nationwide transmission system that was already struggling with large regional imbalances between generation and load. The solution to variable wind and solar output is to smooth out fluctuations across a larger number of generators spread over much larger areas of the country, which will require more transmission and better scheduling.  LONG-DISTANCE TRANSMISSION For decades, the country has been characterised by massive west-to-east electricity transfers from interior areas with surplus generation to the massive load centres on the east and south coasts. Ten provincial-level areas in the east and south (Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong) accounted for 50% of national consumption but only 40% of generation in 2022. By contrast, six remote and sparsely populated northern and western areas (Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia) accounted for 18% of consumption but 25% of generation.  Chartbook: China regional electricity transfers  In response, China's State Grid Corporation has constructed a network of ultra-high voltage transmission lines to move power thousands of kilometres from surplus areas in the west and north to deficit areas in the east and south. In the process, China has become the world leader in ultra-high voltage transmission to move electricity over long distances while minimising line losses, and is exporting its expertise around the world.  INNER ASIA'S ENERGY ABUNDANCE China's northern and western areas are some of the least populated and poorest parts of the country, but rich in energy resources, traditionally coal but now increasingly gas and renewables. The north and west contains the country's most important coal deposits and has become a major centre of pit-head generation, with some electricity used locally by heavy industry, and the rest transmitted east and south. Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Xinjiang alone accounted for 81% of coal mine production and 25% of all thermal generation in 2022, according to data from the NBS. In a quirk of fate, the arid and windswept northern and western plains and deserts are also the best sites for giant wind farms and solar parks. Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Xinjiang together with neighbouring Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai accounted for 42% of all wind and solar generation last year. But the addition of so much wind and solar generation in a region already saturated with coal-fired power threatens to overwhelm the transmission system. During peak periods of wind and solar generation, there is not enough population and industry in these areas to absorb all the output, and not enough long-distance transmission capacity to move the surplus east and south.  MORE TRANSMISSION AND PLANNING In 2016, the national utilisation rate for new energy sources fell to a record low of 84%, prompting the central government to launch a \"Clean Energy Absorption Action Plan\" to reduce the waste of renewable resources. The plan focused on improvements in local distribution, long-distance inter-provincial transmission, and energy trading to reduce the curtailment of new energy generation. By 2023, the utilisation rate for wind power had climbed to a remarkable 97.3% and solar had reached 98%, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. With rapid deployment of renewable capacity, however, the problem of abandonment is re-emerging, with wind utilisation down to 96.1% and solar down to 96% in the first five months of 2024. Sliding utilisation has prompted an alert from the National New Energy Consumption Monitoring and Early Warning Center (\"Solving the pain points and difficulties of new energy consumption\", Xinhua, July 1, 2024). The response is likely to be similar, with renewed emphasis on integrating renewables at local level and more transmission capacity to move surplus power across provincial boundaries. In the last two years, central government policy statements have repeatedly focused on the need for better coordination of transmission and generation between provinces.  CREATING A TRULY NATIONAL SYSTEM In a sign of the importance attached to the issue, the Communist Party's Politburo held a group study session on new energy technology and energy security on Feb. 29, 2024. The session, bringing together top central and regional leaders, included a discussion on boosting \"the grid's capacity capability to integrate, distribute and regulate clean energy.\" President Xi Jinping stressed need for \"coordinated development of the energy sector\" (\"Xi stresses high-quality development of new energy\", CPC International Department, March 2, 2024). In many ways, China's long-distance UVDC transmission system is an extraordinary engineering achievement, likely to be copied in other parts of the world as more and more renewables are connected to grids. It has enabled a remarkable penetration of intermittent renewables, as well as hydroelectric generation, into the national power system while maintaining or improving reliability. As a result, wind and solar producers supplied 15% of all generation in the first five months of 2024, up from 7% in the same period in 2019. In some ways, however, China is still struggling to forge a truly integrated nationwide system from fragmented provincial-level utilities that pursue their own priorities. If government plans to achieve even higher renewables penetration are to be achieved, there will have to be much closer links and more coordination between different types of generators and across far wider areas.By John Kemp",

            "articleBody": "SINGAPORE: Norway is seeking to form a stronger partnership with Indonesia and explore investment opportunities in renewable energy such as hydropower, and carbon capture and storage, the energy minister said. \"A lot of opportunities are there, and there are some hurdles, but I hope we can build a stronger partnership in years to come,\" Energy Minister Terje Aasland told Reuters late on Thursday after meeting his counterpart Arifin Tasrif in Jakarta earlier this week. While Norway aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, it also continues to explore and develop new oil and gas fields, including in the Arctic's Barents Sea, to maintain output that is expected to peak in 2025. The country became Europe's largest supplier of natural gas after a sharp reduction in Russian deliveries since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022. Norwegian companies can contribute their experience in hydropower and carbon capture and storage (CCS) in Indonesia to reduce emissions in the country, Aasland said. Storage capacity at Norway's first CCS project Northern Lights will be ready this year, and is on track to start capturing carbon dioxide from a cement plant in Brevik next May, he said. Aasland met representatives from Norwegian firms in Singapore on Thursday including Equinor, DNB and Yarra, which are investing in renewables, energy storage and alternative fuels such as ammonia in Asia Pacific. Norway, which is western Europe's largest oil and gas producer, generates a total output of just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd). Norwegian gas supplies to Europe is expected to reach 120 billion cubic metres (bcm) this year, Aasland said, up from 109 bcm in 2023. \"Oil and gas will also play a crucial role in the coming decades because of the needs to energy security and affordable prices,\" Aasland said, adding that the country needs to secure supply chain for green transition. Norway aims to give exploration permits for seabed mining in the Arctic region next year, hoping to extract minerals needed for solar panels, wind turbines and electric car batteries needed to replace fossil fuel energy, although the plan faces opposition from environmental groups and some European countries. \"Today we depend on Russia and China so we have to diversify the value chain for minerals in the coming years and we are looking into how we can develop the activity in the Norwegian Continental Shelf in a sustainable manner,\" Aasland added.",

According to Kush, CEO, Essar Power, Union Budget 2024 is anticipated to offer strategic initiatives that would drive growth and sustainability.&ldquo;We hope to see significant allocations towards renewable energy projects, enhanced grid infrastructure, and innovative technologies. Additionally, policy reforms aimed at reducing regulatory bottlenecks and promoting private investment will be crucial,&rdquo; he said.Kush added that these measures would not only help in meeting the growing energy demands but also in achieving the nation's ambitious targets for a greener and more resilient energy future.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the full Union Budget on 24 July 2024 at 11 am with the Economic Survey set to be tabled in Parliament on 23 July 2024.Alessandro Des Dorides, CEO, Nayara Energy said that India, being the fastest growing economies in the world, has a high energy demand, and there is a need to encourage investments in expanding refining and petrochemical capacities.&ldquo;We anticipate a budget that prioritizes the energy security of the nation&hellip; Offering tax incentives, supporting faster clearances, facilitating land acquisition will encourage both domestic and foreign investments,&rdquo; he said. He added that investment schemes for the petrochemical industry will enhance the country&rsquo;s self-sufficiency and promote substantial investment.&ldquo;The government has set a target of 20 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol or gasoline by 2025 and the early success of the program has well-positioned India on a sustainable growth path&hellip; This should be continued,&rdquo; he added.To further accelerate India&rsquo;s transition towards a low-carbon economy the government could consider incentivising users to replace gray hydrogen with green hydrogen, providing incentives for corporates to fund R&amp;D, and developing centralised or shared renewable energy storage systems, he added.According to Pankaj Kalra, CEO, Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, with economic activities on the rise and considering the geo-political scenario, the demand for oil and gas is expected to remain stronger for longer. &ldquo;As the country has plans to raise the share of gas in the energy mix to 15 per cent, we foresee that the upcoming Union Budget prioritizes policy frameworks and measures for the oil and gas sector,&rdquo; he said. Kalra said that addressing the tax structure in this sector is imperative as natural gas, crude oil, and other petroleum products remain outside the GST ambit, leading to an increasing demand for their inclusion in the GST regime. The government&rsquo;s policy reforms can significantly strengthen the energy sector and ensure stability amidst volatile global crude markets. We aim this upcoming budget will focus on growth, collaboration between industry stakeholders and policymakers will be crucial ones for incessant development, he added.",

            "articleBody": "Britain, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, erstwhile coal-burning imperial behemoth, wants to be a &ldquo;clean energy superpower.&rdquo;At least that&rsquo;s the promise of the man poised to be the next prime minister, Keir Starmer. His Labour Party was projected to win the parliamentary elections Thursday, ending 14 years of Conservative Party rule.Labour made big campaign promises on climate. How that actually plays out will be felt not only in the daily lives of people in Britain, but also on the nation&rsquo;s standing in the world.Britain is one of history&rsquo;s major climate polluters. It&rsquo;s where the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, giving rise to a global economy driven by coal, oil and gas and with it, the emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases. So the speed and scale of Britain&rsquo;s energy transition is likely to be closely watched by other industrialized countries and emerging economies alike.Britain likes to think of itself as a global climate leader. In 2008, it became the first among major industrialized countries to pass a climate change law. Its emissions have dramatically fallen since then. In 2021, its government set a legally binding target to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by 78% by 2035, relative to 1990 levels, in one of the most ambitious climate laws in the world.Getting there, though, is the hard part. The new government will face a cost-of-living crisis at home, geopolitical turbulence abroad and a battery of extreme weather events exacerbated by the rise in fossil-fuel emissions.Here are three things to watch as the new government gets to work.What will it take to pivot away from fossil fuels? Starmer&rsquo;s campaign manifesto promised &ldquo;zero-carbon electricity by 2030.&rdquo;Lucky for him, the country is already on its way there.It no longer counts on coal to generate the bulk of its electricity. The last coal-burning power plant is slated to shut down in September. Coal has gone from supplying 40% of its electricity in 2012 to near zero today, according to an analysis by Carbon Brief, an independent climate news site.The challenge now is to reduce reliance on gas. In 2023, it supplied a little over 30% of Britain&rsquo;s electricity. The government must reduce that to zero by 2030, or find ways to capture and bury the greenhouse gases that gas plants produce.Labour Party leaders have also said they would double wind capacity on land, quadruple wind capacity offshore and triple solar power.Joss Garman, executive director at the European Climate Foundation, called the zero-carbon-electricity promise a &ldquo;stretch goal&rdquo; that would require changing the laws of the approval of wind and solar projects.What&rsquo;s the future of North Sea oil?Oil extraction in the North Sea has steadily declined over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to drop through midcentury.Still, the question of oil and gas licenses in the North Sea is politically charged.Last year, the incumbent Conservative Party prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said Britain should &ldquo;max out&rdquo; North Sea oil and gas. He put in place a system to issue new licenses, prompting the resignation of a former energy minister, who said it would cause &ldquo;future harm.&rdquo;Starmer&rsquo;s party has said it would honor the existing licenses but refrain from issuing new ones.Oil and gas companies already face a 75% tax in Britain. The incoming Labour government has said it would slightly increase that to 78%.There&rsquo;s another wrinkle, and that&rsquo;s Scotland.Scottish nationalists have pressed for a greater say over North Sea oil and gas, because it&rsquo;s in Scottish waters. The decline of production there is likely to be felt first and most acutely by communities along Scotland&rsquo;s northeastern coast, which depend on the industry for jobs.Will climate action remain polarizing? Unlike in the United States, there was broad political consensus in Britain around the need to address climate change. In fact, climate action was a conservative darling.Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the alarm on climate change. Theresa May, also a conservative prime minister, led the charge for a net-zero target by 2050, which means that Britain, by law, must take out as much greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere as the country injects into it by midcentury. In 2021, Boris Johnson&rsquo;s government pledged to reduce emissions by 78% by 2035.Recently, that goal has changed. Sunak cast the green transition as too costly. For example, what was to be a 2030 ban on new petroleum and diesel-powered cars was pushed back to 2035.Starmer is likely to restore the 2030 deadline. He has also promised to double funding for energy efficiency programs and create a new national energy company that he says will cut energy bills.At the same time, there&rsquo;s pressure from the far-right Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, to drop the net-zero-by-2050 target altogether. Exit polls project Farage&rsquo;s party to have a surprisingly large foothold in Parliament, reflecting the rise of the far right across Europe.",

ADB was the mandated lead arranger for the entire loan totalling Rs 14.6 billion (approximately USD 175.9 million) with ADB and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank both providing Rs 7.3 billion, the Manila-based multilateral funding agency said in a statement.  The project will support the Government of India's target of achieving at least 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030.  \"The private sector's engagement in the fight against climate change is pivotal for achieving a clean energy transition in Asia and the Pacific,\" said ADB Director General for Private Sector Operations Suzanne Gaboury.  This project exemplifies how ADB, as the region's climate bank, supports the private sector in developing renewable energy projects through long-term local currency financing typically unavailable in local capital markets, the statement said.  This is the second project that ADB has financed for the ENGIE group in India, following the financing of the group's flagship project in the country in 2020, and exemplifies our focus on mobilizing long-term financing from partner organizations.  The solar panels will be constructed using locally produced bifacial photovoltaic power modules, thereby diversifying the solar module supply chain and supporting India-based manufacturers, it said.  The plant will generate an average of 805 gigawatt-hours annually over the next 25 years, avoiding nearly 662,441 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year, it said.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: A new study finds that rising temperatures are driving increased levels of PM2.5 pollution in major Indian cities, presenting a significant environmental challenge. The study, \"Influence of Temperature on PM2.5 concentration over major cities in India during April and May,\" examines data from Delhi, Lucknow, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Patna, demonstrating the link between temperature and air quality.In Delhi, PM2.5 levels dropped by 28.4 per cent from 93.81 &micro;g/m&sup3; in April-May 2022 to 67.19 &micro;g/m&sup3; in the same period in 2023. However, 2024 saw a rise of 21.3 per cent to 81.53 &micro;g/m&sup3;. Concurrently, Delhi's average temperature decreased from 32.15&deg;C in 2022 to 28.72&deg;C in 2023, before increasing by 11 per cent to 31.87&deg;C in 2024.Kolkata experienced a 28 per cent increase in PM2.5 levels from 26.50 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2022 to 33.93 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2023, followed by an 11.3 per cent decrease to 30.10 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2024. The city's temperature remained stable from 2022 to 2023, with a slight decrease from 30.28&deg;C to 30.27&deg;C, and then rose by 2.5 per cent to 31.04&deg;C in 2024.Patna showed fluctuations in both PM2.5 levels and average temperature. PM2.5 levels decreased from 2022 to 2023, followed by a significant rise in 2024. Similarly, temperature trends showed a decrease from 2022 to 2023 and an increase in 2024.In Lucknow, PM2.5 levels decreased by 27.7 per cent from 73.16 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2022 to 52.87 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2023, then increased by 17.6 per cent to 62.17 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2024. Temperature trends also showed a decrease from 2022 to 2023 and a subsequent increase in 2024, suggesting a strong influence of temperature changes on air quality.Mumbai's temperature slightly decreased from 29.55&deg;C in 2022 to 29.42&deg;C in 2023, and further to 29.20&deg;C in 2024. PM2.5 levels were 43.17 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2022, which decreased to 30.84 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2023, and slightly further to 30.46 &micro;g/m&sup3; in 2024.The study utilized data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for PM2.5 concentrations and temperature data from the ERA5 dataset, covering April and May for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. The analysis indicated that meteorological parameters significantly influence PM2.5 concentrations.Dr. Palak Balyan, Research Lead at Climate Trends, stated, &ldquo;PM2.5 concentration can be influenced by various factors, including temperature. Extreme temperatures can enhance the photochemical reactions that can lead to the formation of various secondary pollutants, while also influencing atmospheric stability and pollutant dispersion. So while we are alarmed by the record-breaking levels of air pollution in the winter months, the pollution in the summer months could harm us in different ways. Understanding the interplay between PM2.5 levels and temperature is crucial for developing effective air quality management and public health protection strategies.\"Dr. Harshal Salve, Additional Professor of Community Medicine at AIIMS New Delhi, commented, &ldquo;High levels of pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 can exacerbate respiratory conditions, trigger asthma attacks, and lead to cardiovascular problems. We already see vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly, exhibiting heightened signs of these during the winter months, its burden during summer further adds to the risk. Heat waves increase dust pollution adding to the double whammy. Policymakers must undertake measures that reduce sources of air pollution throughout the year and not just mask them during the winter months. Climate and health co-benefits of air pollution mitigation must be considered while ideating and implementing policies.&rdquo;The report concludes that PM2.5 concentrations across the studied cities consistently exceed national standards throughout most days in April and May from 2022 to 2024. The findings underscore regional temperature variations and provide essential insights into climate dynamics and heat patterns during these months in urban centers. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for formulating effective pollution control strategies and safeguarding public health.",

            "articleBody": "Astana: Climate change is a prominent concern before the world today and India is working towards achieving committed reduction in emissions and building climate-resilient infrastructure, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. Jaishankar was delivering Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit here in the Kazakh capital.  \"Delivered India's statement at the Summit of SCO Council of Heads of States on behalf of PM Shri @narendramodi ji. Thank the leaders present for conveying their best wishes to Prime Minister @narendramodi on his re-election for a third successive term,\" Jaishankar posted on X along with photos.  \"We are working towards achieving a committed reduction in emissions, including transition to alternate fuels, adoption of electric vehicles, and building climate-resilient infrastructure,\" he said.  \"In this context, during India's SCO presidency, a Joint Statement on emerging fuels, and a Concept Paper on de-carbonization in the transportation sector were approved,\" Jaishankar added.  During last year's annual climate conference, Prime Minister Modi said India has already declared to achieve Net Zero by 2070. It plans to reduce emissions intensity by 45 per cent by 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuel to 50 per cent.  The remarks also pointed out how economic development requires robust connectivity. \"That can also pave the way for cooperation and trust between our societies,\" Jaishankar said.  \"Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity is essential for connectivity and infrastructure projects. So too are non-discriminatory trade rights and transit regimes,\" he said, and asserted: \"The SCO needs to deliberate seriously on these aspects.\"  Jaishankar also reminded the audience that the SCO needs to make \"technology creative\" and apply it to the welfare and progress of societies.  \"India is among the countries to formulate a National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence and the launch of an AI Mission. Our commitment to 'AI for All' is also reflected in working within the SCO framework on a Roadmap on AI cooperation,\" he added.",

CII Karnataka will be taking forward the initiatives for the year 2024-25 aligned to the theme \"Globally Competitive Karnataka - Partnerships for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth,\" its Chairman N Venu said at a press conference here. The focus will be on policy advocacy, thought leadership, inclusiveness, ecosystem competitiveness, growth, sustainability, global linkages, and international partnerships, he said.Collaborating closely with the government, CII Karnataka aims to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, Venu said, adding, key areas include technology and innovation, clean and alternative energy, MSME (Micro, Small, &amp; Medium Enterprises) growth, and emerging sectors such as semiconductors, solar and mobile phones (electronic).According to him, CII will continue to work closely with the policy makers on ease of doing business and sectoral policies with a focus on promoting clean energy and alternative fuels, strengthening competitiveness of MSMEs, building stronger industry-academia and industry-startup connects to drive industrial growth both in and beyond Bengaluru. \"We are committed to embracing advanced technologies and fostering innovation, which will be fundamental to our efforts of supporting industry 4.0 transformation. Our goal is to strengthen Karnataka's position as the hub for cutting-edge research, development, and implementation. By collaborating with stakeholders and leveraging technology, we believe we can make remarkable progress,\" he said. Vice Chairman of CII Karnataka, Rabindra Srikantan, said CII Karnataka's commitment to growth aligns with the aspirations of the state. \"MSMEs play a vital role in Karnataka's economic landscape. It is crucial to support industry through services that drive competitiveness, sustainability and transformation, build business connects and linkages to growth through partnerships,\" Srikantan said.According to CII Karnataka, emerging sectors such as aerospace, electric mobility, healthcare, and agri-tech hold immense potential for growth and job creation. Karnataka makes a significant contribution to the country's GDP; however, the majority of the growth in Karnataka comes from Bengaluru. The 'Beyond Bengaluru' initiative intends to empower tier 2 and 3 cities across Karnataka to allow them to meaningfully contribute to the economic growth in the state, it was noted. Venu said CII would also proactively engage with various stakeholders, including international consulates, to seek out business opportunities, promote job preparedness through focused programmes and cross learning initiatives for both faculty and students, and strengthen entrepreneurship and leadership development through targeted initiatives such as the 'CII Indian Women Network' and 'CII Young Indians.'",

            "articleBody": "Paris: The chief executive officer of the world's main verifier for corporate climate targets is stepping down after facing staff demands that he quit over the organisation's backflip on carbon credits.Luiz Amaral said late Tuesday he would depart as CEO of the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) at the end of the month for \"personal reasons\".It follows a staff revolt in April after SBTi announced it would consider allowing the companies it vets to use carbon credits to offset pollution across their supply chain.Carbon credits are generated by projects that reduce or avoid emissions like renewable energy or tree planting, but critics say they allow the companies that buy them to keep polluting without cleaning up their act.SBTi's decision represented a reversal of its long-held stance on the limited use of such offsets, and sparked immediate calls for Amaral and the group's board to resign.Amaral's statement made no reference to the furore, but cited personal reasons that \"require my full attention at this time, prompting my decision to step down\".The group's chief legal officer, Susan Jenny Ehr, would act as CEO on an interim basis.SBTi, which is partnered with the UN and WWF, and receives funding from the Bezos Earth Fund and IKEA Foundation, is the gold standard benchmark for assessing the net zero plans of big businesses. Verification by SBTi allows companies to say their climate plans align with science and the goals of the Paris agreement to limit global warming.- 'License to pollute' -Amaral said the organisation had verified the climate targets of more than 5,500 companies and financial institutions and thousands of others were seeking validation.The organisation had previously held a narrow view on carbon credits, requiring companies take action first to reduce their greenhouse gas output, and only turn to offsets for the remaining, hardest-to-cut emissions.Then in April it flagged relaxing these rules in regards to offsetting Scope 3 emissions, which occur in the value chain, and represent the lion's share of the carbon footprints of most companies.In an open letter, staff criticised the way the decision was taken, accusing the board of ignoring the organisation's internal expert and scientific advice about the use of carbon credits.A single credit is supposed to represent one tonne of CO2 removed from the atmosphere or prevented from entering it, but revelations some do little or nothing for the environment have damaged their credibility.Just hours before Amaral's resignation, more than 80 civil society groups including Greenpeace and Amnesty International publicly called for SBTi to rule out the use of carbon credits.\"Offsetting often ends up providing the social license for high-emitting activities to continue\" and allowing companies to use them would \"likely slow down\" global efforts to address climate change, they warned.",

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: China's President Xi Jinping said he supports Kazakhstan joining the BRICS bloc, Chinese state media reported on Wednesday, as the group of developing nations mulls further expansion to rival a Western-dominated world order it sees as outdated. Speaking to the press alongside Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev following a meeting in the Central Asian state's capital, Xi encouraged Kazakhstan to \"play the role of a middle power on the international stage and make its due contribution to global governance\", while endorsing Astana's accession. China and Russia are pushing for the expansion of the BRICS grouping, which also includes Brazil, India and South Africa, as they seek to counter Western economic dominance. Originally an acronym coined by Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill in 2001, the bloc was founded as an informal four-nation club in 2009 and added South Africa a year later. Last August, the BRICS bloc agreed to admit Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates. However, Saudi Arabia has not yet joined the group.  Argentina had planned to join BRICS, but President Javier Milei withdrew his country soon after taking office in December. Xi is in Kazakhstan to attend a heads of state meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization from July 3-4. During his meeting with Tokayev, China and Kazakhstan also agreed to double their two-way trade as soon as possible and deepen cooperation in oil and gas exploration, extraction and processing, the report added. Crude oil and petroleum gases made up the bulk of Kazakhstan's exports to China last year, according to United Nations COMTRADE data, with outbound shipments to the world's No.2 economy worth $3.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. As such, Xi and Tokayev agreed to take measures to ensure the long-term, safe and stable operation of the crude oil pipeline running between their respective countries and the Kazakhstan section of the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline running from China's Xinjiang region to Turkmenistan, the report said. The two leaders also pledged to strengthen cooperation in clean energy, including wind, solar and nuclear power, with Chinese companies stepping in to help upgrade Kazakhstan's energy grid and power stations. Chinese firms have invested $9.5 billion in Kazakhstan since Xi first proposed his flagship Belt and Road Initiative during a state visit in 2013, data from the American Enterprise Institute think tank shows, almost all of which has been in the state's petroleum or nuclear energy industries.",

            "articleBody": "The newest technology in the fight against climate change has suffered its biggest loss. Last month, carbon removal startup Running Tide announced it was shutting down after failing to secure further funding. It won&rsquo;t be the last.Founded in 2017, Running Tide aimed to grow macroalgae to capture carbon dioxide, then sink it deep in the ocean where it wouldn&rsquo;t release that carbon for centuries. Scientific studies raised questions about whether such techniques could work at large scale. Last year, Running Tide claimed it delivered hundreds of tons of removal to Shopify, though it did so by sinking wood instead of seaweed.Tackling climate change requires reducing planet-warming emissions first. But the lack of sufficient action means the world will have to draw down CO2 in the atmosphere. The urgency of doing so, combined with some clever ways to finance climate technologies, has now created more than 800 carbon removal startups. Most of them are likely to meet Running Tide&rsquo;s fate.&ldquo;We expect more of this to happen in the coming months and years,&rdquo; said Nan Ransohoff, head of climate at the payments company Stripe Inc. and lead of Frontier, a fund that aims to accelerate the development of carbon removal technologies. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a sign of what an early ecosystem looks like.&rdquo;The automobile industry is a good example of what healthy development can look like. The US had hundreds of small automakers in the early 20th century, but only three big ones remain. Similarly, China had more than 500 companies registered as makers of electric vehicles as recently as 2019. Today, there are only a few dozen.But there&rsquo;s a big difference. People want cars, but they don&rsquo;t clamor in the same way for carbon removal. That&rsquo;s partly because of the cost. Reducing emissions is cheaper than removing CO2 from the air. Within the carbon removal industry, there are a range of prices for different techniques, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell which ones work as promised &mdash; and if the added cost of more verifiable methods is worth it. &ldquo;There are fundamental questions about carbon removal that society needs to answer,&rdquo; said Eric Toone, chief technology officer of Breakthrough Energy. &ldquo;Does society want to pay $500 a ton to be absolutely certain I captured carbon and know exactly where it is? Or does it want to pay 10 cents a ton and hope for the best?&rdquo; The vast majority of carbon for sale today is on the lower end of the scale and buyers are primarily paying to avoid emissions through reducing deforestation or deploying clean energy rather than removing CO2. Bloomberg Green investigations have found a number of fraudulent projects. These tons of carbon are largely bought and sold on the voluntary market, where the ramifications of getting the accounting wrong aren&rsquo;t very high. That incentivizes companies to seek out the cheapest price per ton possible, not the most permanent or verifiable removals, which are often the most costly. &ldquo;The problem is the voluntary carbon market is voluntary,&rdquo; Marty Odlin, founder of Running Tide, wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing it was shuttering. &ldquo;There simply isn&rsquo;t the demand needed to support large scale carbon removal.&rdquo;That lack of demand is why there were hardly any startups in the space a few years ago. In 2019, that started to change when Stripe decided to drive the creation of a high-quality carbon removal market. At first, it meant spending millions of dollars of its own money buying carbon removal credits from companies at whatever cost they would sell. Stripe did so knowing some companies wouldn&rsquo;t be able to deliver. Ransohoff said Running Tide got one such deal from Stripe worth $500,000 (of which $150,000 was for 600 tons of removal and the rest for research).Once that spurred the creation of some startups, Stripe led the creation of Frontier. The platform secured more than $900 million from companies like Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. to make advanced-purchase commitments that only pay startups once they deliver verifiable carbon removal tons. (Frontier also has a pre-purchase track for smaller orders from younger companies.)&ldquo;The world needs about 5 billion tons of carbon removal per year by 2050 as part of its net-zero strategy,&rdquo; said Ransohoff. &ldquo;If you then pull that back, the world needs between 50 and 100 million tons each year by 2030. That is a $20 billion market at $200 per ton.&rdquo;But now that there are hundreds of startups, Ransohoff said the market is likely to face a new problem: too much supply and not enough buyers. Some founders and investors argue that this overabundance is not a glitch in the system, but the way the industry was built by design: Throw everything against the wall and see what sticks. But Stripe is also working to grow demand. It has created a new fellowship program that will fund people committed to finding new buyers. And some governments are also stepping in to buy removal services, which is the kind of policy that helped cut the price of solar panels and lithium-ion batteries.Toone thinks there&rsquo;s always room for startups that can offer cheaper technologies. He believes that, if the cost of removal can be brought down to $100 a ton, then there&rsquo;s a market for using it as feedstock to make products, such as synthetic gasoline. &ldquo;One-hundred dollars a ton is the equivalent of 85 cents a gallon to the cost of gasoline,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I would be very interested in that.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s likely to mean more Running Tide-type failures for startups that can&rsquo;t lower removal costs.",

            "articleBody": "A year and a half after Hindenburg Research accused Gautam Adani of \"pulling the largest con in corporate history,\" the Indian market regulator is yet to conclude if the tycoon, said to be close to Narendra Modi, violated any securities laws. The inquiry has now shot itself in the foot by turning its gaze toward Asia&rsquo;s richest banker. Ordered by the Supreme Court to probe the allegations of price manipulation and accounting fraud against Adani &mdash; which he has strenuously denied &mdash; the Securities and Exchange Board, or SEBI, has stumbled upon a connection between last year&rsquo;s $150 billion meltdown in the conglomerate&rsquo;s stocks and billionaire Mumbai financier Uday Kotak. Even the disclosure of this link is courtesy of Hindenburg. The short seller has made public the show-cause notice it received last week from the SEBI. In the process of knocking down the letter, which it described as an attempt to &ldquo;silence and intimidate those who expose corruption and fraud perpetrated by the most powerful individuals in India,&rdquo; it revealed that the vehicle used to bet against Adani&rsquo;s flagship firm belonged to Kotak Mahindra (International) Ltd., a Mauritius-based subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.But the fund in question is only managed by the Kotak firm. The principal is New York-based hedge fund manager Mark Kingdon&rsquo;s Kingdon Capital Management. SEBI&rsquo;s notice includes extracts of time-stamped chats, where an employee of the American firm appears to be instructing a Kotak trader to sell futures contracts in Adani Enterprises Ltd. This went on for about two weeks, the SEBI says, ahead of the publication of the Hindenburg report on Jan. 24, 2023. The Kingdon-controlled fund squared off its short positions the following month for a profit of $22 million, shared between Kingdon and Hindenburg, which provided the research. Kotak was nothing more than a middleman, executing the trades.As Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a statement after its shares fell 2% Tuesday, &ldquo;Kingdon never disclosed that they had any relationship with Hindenburg nor that they were acting on the basis of any price sensitive information.&rdquo; Hindenburg says it expects SEBI may try to impose bans or fines on the research firm. Kingdon told the SEBI he obtained legal advice about putting trades based on Hindenburg&rsquo;s draft report before it was made public, and that he isn&rsquo;t obliged to share the contents of the privileged communication.Ultimately, the only entity over which the Indian regulator has any jurisdiction here is the fund, a SEBI-registered foreign portfolio investor. That&rsquo;s perhaps the only reason to drag Kotak&rsquo;s Mauritius subsidiary into the inquiry &mdash; to stay in business, it has to cooperate. But by revealing the Indian institution&rsquo;s involvement, Hindenburg is challenging the regulator to go further and expand its scrutiny to the prominent Mumbai financier as well.That&rsquo;s a little odd. If the Indian banker was really acting in cahoots with the US short sellers, why would the research firm be throwing him under the bus? Hindenburg&rsquo;s larger point here is about fairness. After all, the SEBI has sent its show-cause notice to both Mark Kingdon and Nathan Anderson, the Hindenburg founder, accusing them of violating its regulations along with their firms. It has sent a similar notice to Kotak&rsquo;s Mauritius subsidiary, too, because it is the manager of the fund used for short-selling. Yet, the regulator has decided to keep Kotak, the banker, out of its investigation. &ldquo;We suspect SEBI&rsquo;s lack of mention of Kotak or any other Kotak board member may be meant to protect yet another powerful businessman from the prospect of scrutiny, a role SEBI seems to embrace,&rdquo; Hindenburg said in its response to the notice. The securities watchdog has invited this embarrassment upon itself. A year ago, the SEBI was telling a court-appointed panel that it was investigating the 13 opaque offshore entities that held, as of March 2020, between 14% and 20% across five publicly traded stocks of the Adani Group. It wanted to verify whether the 42 investors who put capital into these 13 vehicles &mdash; 12 funds and one overseas financial firm &mdash; were mere fronts for Adani and his family, masquerading as public shareholders. The conglomerate has denied these allegations.A year later, however, the focus seems to have changed. While it did send a couple of show-cause notices to the Adani flagship during the March quarter, there&rsquo;s still no sign of the final report it was supposed to submit to the Supreme Court by April after concluding its investigation into the $207 billion Adani empire. Instead, the regulator is taking on the short sellers, a clear indication that proving or rejecting their allegations against the Indian infrastructure czar is no longer the priority. And for that, Adani should consider sending a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; note to Anderson, the Hindenburg founder.The Indian group&rsquo;s market capitalisation plunged by $45 billion in just one day after the election result fell short of an outright majority for Modi&rsquo;s party. The conglomerate regained its footing as the prime minister began his third five-year term with the help of coalition partners, though its valuation is still $28 billion lower than before the short-seller report last year. Now that the SEBI inquiry has gone in the wrong direction, and Hindenburg has dared the watchdog by bringing up Kotak&rsquo;s name, Adani can go in search of new infrastructure deals &mdash; from transport and energy to data centers and building materials. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he won&rsquo;t be asking Kotak Mahindra to pony up money.The views expressed here are the author's own, and not EconomicTimes.com's",

            "articleBody": "Singapore: India's solar power generation grew at the slowest pace in six years in the first half of 2024, an analysis of data from the federal grid regulator showed, as the country further stepped up reliance on coal to address surging power demand. Electricity generated from coal grew 10.4 per cent during six months ended June 30, a review of daily load despatch data from Grid-India showed, outpacing overall power generation growth of 9.7 per cent during the period.  Solar power generation in the third-largest producer of electricity from the sun rose to 63.6 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in the first half of 2024, the data showed, up 14.7 per cent compared with the same period last year and 18.5 per cent in the calendar year 2023. The world's fastest growing major economy has prioritised coal to address a surge in power demand in recent years, with coal-fired power output last year outpacing renewable energy output for the first time since the Paris accord in 2015. The south Asian nation's fuel use patterns since emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic have largely been in line with trends in the region, with Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Bangladesh all firing up coal for generating inexpensive power. The share of the fossil fuel in power output rose to 77.1 per cent in the first half of 2024, compared with 76.6 per cent in the same period last year, putting it on track to rise for the fourth straight year. India expects total electricity generation during the fiscal year ended March 2025 to grow at the fastest pace in over a decade, forecast to be mainly powered by an 8.9 per cent growth in coal-fired power output, outpacing renewable energy growth of 8.2 per cent. Analysts expect renewable generation to grow faster from the next fiscal year, as tendering and commissioning of green energy projects have started picking up steam. Moody's unit ICRA expects renewable energy installations to rise by over a third to 25 gigawatts (GW) this fiscal year ending March 2025.",

            "articleBody": "Islamabad: Pakistan has decided to approach its all-weather ally China with a formal request to restructure its USD 15 billion energy debt to help the cash-strapped country wriggle out of its financial woes. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb would visit China this week, the Express Tribune newspaper quoted highly placed sources as saying. While Iqbal's visit was pre-planned, the finance minister is being sent as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's special messenger, they added. Iqbal is scheduled to attend the Global Development Initiative forum to be held in China from July 11 to 13. As the finance minister's visit was not scheduled earlier, Pakistan's ambassador to Beijing has been instructed to arrange meetings with Chinese authorities, said the sources. A Cabinet member, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the premier decided the issue of Chinese Independent Power Producers' (IPP) debt should be immediately taken up for \"re-profiling\". According to the sources, the finance minister will carry a letter from Prime Minister Sharif requesting debt restructuring. During the June 4-8 visit, Prime Minister Sharif requested President Xi Jinping to consider re-profiling the IPPs' debt and converting the imported-coal-fired power plants. Aurangzeb will seek approval for a mechanism to proceed, though Chinese authorities have repeatedly refused to restructure these deals. The delegation would also formally convey Pakistan's request to convert Chinese-imported coal-fired power plants to local coal. They said there is a proposal for the government to help Chinese investors arrange loans from local banks to convert these plants to indigenous coal. The sources added that Habib Bank Limited (HBL) is also engaged in the process. China has set up 21 energy projects in Pakistan with a total cost of USD 21 billion, including about USD 5 billion in equity. Chinese investors obtained loans for these projects at an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) plus 4.5 per cent. Against the remaining Chinese energy debt of over USD 15 billion, payments by 2040 would total USD 16.6 billion, according to government sources. The proposal involves extending debt repayments from 10 to 15 years. This would reduce the outflow of foreign currency by about USD 550 million to USD 750 million per annum and decrease prices by Rs 3 per unit. According to the existing IPP deals, the current power tariff structure requires debt servicing repayments during the first 10 years, leading to a significant burden on consumers who are paying the interest and principal of these loans through higher tariffs. However, due to the extended repayment period, the country will also have to make an extra USD 1.3 billion payment to China, sources said. The Cabinet member stated that Pakistan needs immediate fiscal space and some room for reducing prices, although the overall cost would increase in the long run. The government's economic challenges have multiplied, and it has not yet been able to conclude the International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal or lower electricity prices. To secure the IMF deal, the government imposed a record Rs 1.7 trillion in additional taxes on Pakistan's lower, middle, and upper-middle-income groups. Electricity prices were also approved to increase by 14 per cent to 51 per cent to collect another Rs 580 billion from residential and commercial consumers. However, the Ministry of Finance has not been able to give a firm date for the staff-level agreement with the IMF. Finance Minister Aurangzeb, a former banker, hopes the deal may be reached this month. Despite raising average base tariffs by around Rs 18 per unit over the past two years, the Power Division told the prime minister on Saturday that as of end-May, the circular debt owed to power companies had again increased to Rs 2.65 trillion-Rs 345 billion higher than the level agreed with the IMF. The government has neither been able to give a firm date for the IMF staff-level deal nor reduce the cost of electricity and the circular debt. Pakistani sources indicated that China might not grant further concessions in debt until resolving their over Rs 500 billion outstanding dues and ensuring security for Chinese nationals in Pakistan. IMF bailout packages have hindered Chinese energy deals due to restrictions on repayments. If China agrees to debt restructuring, the repayment period will be extended to 2040, including interest payments. According to Pakistani authorities, repayment would be USD 600 million less this year and can be reduced to just USD 1.63 billion after restructuring. For 2025, debt repayments would decrease from USD 2.1 billion to USD 1.55 billion - a benefit of USD 580 million, sources said. However, the upfront relief would result in more repayments from 2036 to 2040. In April, Prime Minister Sharif ordered all imported coal-fired power plants, including three Chinese plants, to convert to local coal to save USD 800 million annually and reduce consumer rates by Rs 3 per unit. The finance and planning ministers will request Chinese approval for this project and propose financing with HBL.",

            "articleBody": "The United States will fall far short of the Biden administration's 2030 offshore wind goal but will catch up quickly in the following years, according to an analysis by an industry group published on Tuesday. The American Clean Power Association (ACP) projected there will be about 14 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity along U.S. coastlines by 2030. That compares with a goal of 30 GW that President Joe Biden's administration laid out in 2021 as it sought to jumpstart the domestic energy industry. Offshore wind is a key pillar of Biden's promise that fighting climate change will create jobs and invigorate the economy. But soaring materials costs, high interest rates and supply chain snags have led multiple offshore wind companies in the last year to cancel or seek to renegotiate power contracts for planned U.S. offshore wind farms. Those challenges have cast doubt on the industry's ability to meet the administration's timeline. There are just 174 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind capacity currently installed in the U.S. as of June 30, though that more than quadrupled from 42 MW a year ago, according to the ACP. The industry has more than 12 GW in advanced development or under construction, the report said. The U.S. is far behind market leader China, which has nearly 38 GW of offshore wind capacity. The United States will reach the 30 GW target by 2033 and nearly 40 GW by 2035, the ACP said in its offshore wind market report. The industry is on track to invest $65 billion in projects by 2030 and create 56,000 jobs, the ACP added. (Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

            "articleBody": "Singapore investor Temasek expects India's growth to remain firm over the next two years, driven by infrastructure-led capital expenditure, and a recovery in private consumption. Temasek on Tuesday reported an SGD 7 billion rise in its Net Portfolio Value (NPV) to SGD 389 billion for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, mainly driven by gains to the US and India investments.  India has continued to see strong economic momentum alongside improving macro and political stability, the company said in a statement.  \"We expect growth to remain firm over the next two years, primarily driven by infrastructure-led capital expenditure, accelerated supply chain diversification, and a recovery in private consumption,\" Temasek said.  Temasek said its Net Portfolio Value (NPV) rose by SGD 7 billion to SGD 389 billion for the financial year ended March 31, 2024.  \"The increase was mainly due to our investment returns from the US and India, offset by the underperformance of China's capital markets,\" it said.  Temasek said it maintained a cautious but steady investment pace amidst global economic uncertainties, and invested SGD 26 billion into opportunities in sectors such as technology, financial services, sustainability, consumer, and healthcare, aligned with the four structural trends of digitisation, sustainable living, future of consumption, and longer lifespans.  Excluding Singapore, the US continued to be the leading destination for Temasek capital, followed by India and Europe while it has also stepped-up investment activities in Japan.  Temasek divested SGD 33 billion for the year. Of this, about SGD 10 billion was due to the redemption of capital by Singapore Airlines and Pavilion Energy for their mandatory convertible bonds and preferential shares respectively.  Overall, Temasek had a net divestment of SGD 7 billion, compared to a net investment of SGD 4 billion a year ago.  \"We invested in Electric Vehicle companies Mahindra Electric Automobile in India and BYD in China, sustainable battery solutions provider Ascend Elements in the US, and electrolyser manufacturer Electric Hydrogen in the US,\" it added.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will invest about Rs 2 lakh crore in setting up renewable energy sites and green hydrogen plants and cutting gas flaring to zero to achieve its 2038 net-zero carbon emission goal. The company, which produces about two-thirds of India's crude oil and about 58 per cent of natural gas, on Tuesday released a 200-page document, detailing its path to achieving net zero emissions. It listed clean energy projects even as it looks to boost its hydrocarbon output to meet the country's energy needs. ONGC will invest Rs 97,000 crore by 2030 in setting up 5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, green hydrogen, biogas, pump storage plant and offshore wind project, according to the document. Another Rs 65,500 crore will be invested by 2035, mostly in a green hydrogen or green ammonia plant, and the remaining Rs 38,000 crore by 2038, primarily in setting up 1 GW of offshore wind projects. These projects will help the firm offset 9 million tonnes of carbon emissions it is directly (Scope-1 emissions) or indirectly (Scope-2 emissions) responsible for. ONGC said it will invest Rs 5,000 crore to cut gas flaring to zero by 2030 through technological intervention. The firm released into the atmosphere 554 million cubic metres of methane in 2021-22 (base year), mostly because it was an incidental by-product of oil or the quantity was not economical enough to pipe it to consumers. ONGC will spend Rs 30,000 crore in setting up 5 GW solar parks that will convert sunlight into electricity and turbines that will do the same with wind energy. It will add 1 GW of solar and onshore wind capacity by 2035 and 2038 at a cost of Rs 5,000 crore each. It will invest Rs 40,000 crore by 2030 and a similar amount by 2035 to set up two 1,80,000 tonnes per annum green hydrogen and/or 1 million tonnes of green ammonia projects. ONGC, which has installations in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal to produce oil and gas from below the seabed, is also looking at installing offshore wind turbines to generate 0.5 GW of electricity by 2030 and double it by 2035. The first 0.5 GW offshore wind project is likely to cost Rs 12,500 crore and the next about Rs 12,000 crore. By 2038, it will add another 1 GW of offshore wind energy capacity at an investment of Rs 25,000 crore, the document said. The company is also looking at investing Rs 20,000 crore for setting up 3 GW of pump storage plants to meet electricity requirements when renewable sources like sunlight and wind energy are not available. The remaining investment will be in biogas, carbon capture and other clean energy projects. All this while it continues to hunt and produce more oil and gas. Crude oil, which companies like ONGC pump out from below the seabed and from underground reservoirs, is a primary source of energy. It is processed in oil refineries to produce petrol, diesel and jet fuel. With the world looking to transition away from fossil fuels, companies around the globe are looking at new avenues to use crude oil. Gas produced in a similar fashion is used to generate electricity, produce fertiliser or convert into CNG to power automobiles or into PNG to fire kitchen stoves. Scope 1 emissions are from directly emitting sources that are owned or controlled by a company. Scope 2 emissions are from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from a company's direct operations. ONGC produced 21.14 million tonnes of oil in 2023-24 (April 2023 to March 2024) and 20.648 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas.",

The Panchayati Raj Ministry has written to states to share guidelines of the ambitious scheme launched in February 2024 to install rooftop solar panels and provide free electricity up to 300 monthly units for one crore households.  In a letter dated July 8 to all state departments, Additional Secretary of the Panchayati Raj Ministry Chandra Shekhar Kumar asked officials to share the operational guidelines of the scheme with the Panchayati Raj Institutions, officers of State Panchayati Raj Departments and other stakeholders for greater understanding.  He also called for taking \"necessary actions to actively involve in the successful implementation of the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana\".  The Additional Secretary said the scheme would also incentivise Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to promote rooftop solar installations in the rural community and contribute to adopting clean energy in rural areas and create a new Source of Revenue for PRIs.  The Centre approved the scheme to increase the share of solar rooftop capacity and empower residential households to generate their own electricity.  The scheme has an outlay of Rs 75,021 crore and is to be implemented till FY 2026-27.  It provides a central financial assistance (CFA) of 60 per cent of system cost for 2 kW systems and 40 per cent of additional system cost for systems between 2 kW to 3 kW capacity. The CFA will be capped at 3 kW.  The scheme has a Rs. 800 crore budget to develop a \"model village\" in each district for the adoption of rooftop solar in rural areas and a Rs 1000 crore outlay for incentivising local bodies to promote rooftop solar (RTS) installations in their areas.  At current benchmark prices, this will mean Rs 30,000 subsidy for 1 kW system, Rs 60,000 for 2 kW systems and Rs 78,000 for 3 kW systems or higher.  The guidelines also provide an option for giving up the subsidy, which can be availed through the PM Surya Ghar National Portal.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In the upcoming Union Budget for fiscal year 2024-25, set to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23, the power sector may see pivotal changes, including the potential inclusion under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) has put forward a series of proposals aimed at reducing costs and fostering growth within the sector.Currently, the power sector is not covered under GST, which was implemented on July 1, 2017. This exemption has led to an increased tariff burden due to the cascading effect of indirect taxes. NSEFI's proposal for GST inclusion seeks to streamline taxations and lower the cost for consumers and businesses alike.Further recommendations by NSEFI include maintaining the exemption from basic customs duty on imports of key renewable energy components such as wafer, ingots, and polysilicon. This move is intended to bolster the domestic manufacturing of renewable energy infrastructure.Another significant aspect of NSEFI&rsquo;s proposals is the removal of electricity duty (ED) and cross-subsidy surcharge (CSS) on power used in charging Energy Storage Systems (ESS). This measure is expected to encourage the use of energy storage technologies, critical for balancing the intermittency of renewable energy sources.Additionally, the federation has urged the government to introduce Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for Pumped Storage Projects (PSP), similar to the existing support for Battery Energy Storage Systems. This would promote the development of sustainable energy storage solutions, crucial for enhancing India's energy security and integration of renewable resources.NSEFI also seeks support for 100 agrivoltaic pilot projects across India, aiming to synergize solar power generation with agriculture, thus benefiting farmers and aiding the nation in meeting its renewable energy targets.These proposed reforms, if accepted, could significantly impact India's energy landscape, encouraging investments and technological advancements in the renewable energy sector as the country pushes towards its 2030 energy goals.",

Most of this new supply could still be secured by Western and non-Chinese processing firms, the London-based industry consultant said in a new analysis.China mines about 70 per cent of the world&rsquo;s rare earths and refines almost all of the material &ndash; a cluster of 17 elements that make magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and military equipment. Beijing can flex its muscles by limiting both production and exports. In December, the Asian country banned overseas sales of a range of rare-earth technologies.The US and its allies are trying to build supply chains independent of China. While 37 per cent of the future African supply is already destined to be shipped to Chinese buyers, most of the production is &ldquo;potentially available for ex-China and Western rare earths companies,&rdquo; Benchmark said, noting that Europe is developing the most processing facilities outside of China.&ldquo;China will not be the only beneficiary of Africa&rsquo;s active, low cost pipeline, which will also become strategically valuable for the EU and US,&rdquo; it said.None of the companies building the African rare earth mines covered in Benchmark&rsquo;s research &ndash; including Pensana, Rainbow Rare Earths and Mkango Resources &ndash; are Chinese-owned and all are registered in Western countries. However, China&rsquo;s customers will remain crucial for some of the miners to ensure their projects are viable because processing capacity in the West is not expanding quickly enough, the report added.",

            "articleBody": "London: The world risks missing a goal to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 as the current growth rate is inadequate, a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) showed on Thursday.  CONTEXTA UN climate change conference in Dubai last year set a goal of tripling renewable energy capacity worldwide by 2030 to more than 11 terawatts (TW). Countries have to submit new or updated climate target commitments every five years after 2020 so next year they have to include revised ambitions for 2030.  WHY IT'S IMPORTANTAbout 473 gigawatts (GW) of capacity was added last year, representing a 14 per cent increase from the year before and the largest annual growth since 2000, IRENA said in a report.  BY THE NUMBERS To meet the target, the world will have to add renewables capacity at a minimum 16.4 per cent rate annually to 2030. However, if last year's 14 per cent increase rate continues, the 11 TW target will be 1.5 TW short. If the world keeps its historic annual growth rate of 10 per cent, it will only accumulate 7.5 TW of renewables capacity by 2030, missing the target by almost one third, IRENA data showed.  KEY QUOTE \"Renewable energy has been increasingly outperforming fossil fuels, but it is not the time to be complacent,\" said Francesco La Camera, director general of IRENA. \"If we continue with the current growth rate, we will only face failure in reaching the tripling renewables target agreed in the UAE Consensus at COP28,\" he added.

            "articleBody": "Littleton: Combined electricity generation from solar and wind farms in the United States surpassed output from nuclear plants for the first time during the opening half of 2024, cementing renewable energy assets as the primary source of clean power in the country. Electricity generation from utility-scale solar and wind assets during the first half of 2024 was a record 401.4 terawatt hours (TWh), compared to 390.5 TWh from nuclear reactors, data from energy think tank Ember shows. That marked the first time over a half-year period that renewables electricity supplies exceeded nuclear-powered electricity output, and is a significant milestone in US energy transition efforts. With utilities building out solar and wind capacity at a faster pace than any other generation source, 2024 looks set to be the first full year when more US electricity will come from renewables than from any other form of clean power.  MOUNTING SHARE From 2015 through the end of 2023, combined monthly electricity generation from utility-run solar and wind farms only surpassed output from US nuclear plants on three occasions: in April and May of 2022, and in April 2023, according to Ember data. This year, solar plus wind output has surpassed nuclear output for the past four months running, and resulted in solar plus wind output exceeding nuclear output by nearly 3 per cent during the opening half of the year. During the same half-year period a year ago, nuclear-powered electricity output was more than 9 per cent greater than electricity output from solar and wind sources, which underscores how rapid the growth has been in renewable energy output.  FAST PACE During the first half of 2024, electricity generation from solar assets was 149.6 TWh and 251.7 TWh from wind farms. Those totals are up 30 per cent and 10 per cent respectively from the same period in 2023, and were both records for the first half of the year. Nuclear electricity generation during the first half was 3.4 per cent above the same period in 2023, but down slightly from the latter half of 2023 and suggests US nuclear generation may have limited scope for any substantial further gains over the near to medium term.  CAPACITY TRENDS Installed capacity is the key driver of electricity generation potential across the US, and over the past five years renewables capacity has vastly outpaced capacity growth from all other power sources. From 2018 to 2023, utility solar generation capacity leaped 168 per cent to 139 gigawatts (GW) while wind capacity grew 56 per cent to 148 GW, according to Ember. That compares to a nearly 4 per cent reduction in national nuclear generation capacity over that period, and a 40 per cent rise in overall clean electricity generation capacity to roughly 483 GW. Total fossil fuel generation capacity declined by 3.7 per cent from 2018 to 2023 to around 775 GW, including a 23 per cent drop in coal-fired generation capacity. In 2024, developers plan to add a further 34 GW of solar capacity, while wind generation capacity is expected to remain largely flat, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). If those plans are completed, that would mean solar capacity could surpass wind capacity for the first time, and would result in a further large rise in solar electricity generation. And given US nuclear generation is likely to remain flat for the near to medium term, that means combined solar and wind generation potential looks set to make further gains relative to other forms of clean power and to establish renewables as the primary source of clean electricity in the US  By Gavin Maguire",

            "articleBody": "Bogota: Colombia's Constitutional Court on Wednesday annulled a controversial carbon credit deal in the Amazon rainforest, which six local tribes said had been signed without their consent.Indigenous communities living in the remote area of Pira Parana had accused US-based Ruby Canyon Environmental and Colombian company Masbosques, which acted as an intermediary, of illegally foisting the deal on them.Carbon credits are bought by corporations -- or countries under certain conditions -- from forest preservation or other projects to offset or \"compensate\" their greenhouse gas emissions.This money is supposed to go to local communities that protect their home regions from deforestation.In Pira Parana, the credits -- also known as green bonds -- were sold for about $3.8 million to a Colombian data processing firm called Latin Checkout.According to EcoRegistry, which keeps tabs on carbon credit trading, Latin Checkout then sold the credits to US airline Delta which faces a lawsuit at home for alleged \"greenwashing\" by claiming to be carbon-neutral while purchasing questionable carbon offsets.The deal, signed in March 2021, was for the Indigenous communities to preserve an area of 7,100 square kilometers (2,741 miles) -- close to the size of Puerto Rico.But the tribes said the deal was signed with false representatives of their communities.They went to court claiming violations of their rights to territorial autonomy and self-government.On Monday, the court ordered the tribes' legitimate representatives to meet and decide within six months whether to authorize a new agreement.If they do not, authorities must \"ensure\" the carbon credit project \"is no longer carried out in the territory,\" the judges ruled.The concept behind carbon credits has taken a major hit recently as scientific research has repeatedly shown claims of reduced emissions being hugely overestimated -- or even nonexistent.In late 2023, AFP walked, motor-boated and overflew part of the Pira Parana territory, an area so remote it is accessible only by million-dollar private flights or a boat trip of at least six days from the nearest city of Mitu.There, local leaders said they wished they had never heard of the deal.While it brought an economic \"bonanza,\" it also led to conflict in communities unaccustomed to handling large sums of money and a loss of Indigenous autonomy, they said.The project \"contaminates spiritually, physically, it destroys everything... in this territory, for money,\" Indigenous leader Fabio Valencia said at the time.Some experts have said there was no real deforestation threat in the area and therefore no emissions \"savings\" to be made.The Constitutional Court case was the first of its kind in Colombia.",

            "articleBody": "Beijing: China is building almost twice as much wind and solar energy capacity as every other country combined, research published Thursday showed.The world's second-largest economy is the biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that drive climate change.China has committed to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.It has endured several waves of extreme weather in recent months that scientists say are rendered more severe by climate change.China currently has a total of 339 gigawatts (GW) of capacity under construction, including 159 GW of wind and 180 GW of solar.That is \"nearly twice as much as the rest of the world combined\", according to the study by Global Energy Monitor, a US-based NGO.The figure far exceeds the second-ranked nation, the United States, which is building a total of just 40 GW, the report said.It said China has broken ground on a third of new wind and solar capacity it has announced to date, compared to a global average of just seven percent.\"The stark contrast in construction rates illustrates the active nature of China's commitment to building renewables projects,\" the study said.'Turning point?'Beijing's vast renewable energy buildout does have some drawbacks.The national grid falls back on heavily polluting coal plants to deal with surges in power demand.And it struggles to transmit renewable energy generated in remote northwestern regions to economic and population centres in the east.However, China's combined wind and solar capacity is set to overtake coal this year, according to the report.It said the rapid renewables expansion raises hopes that Beijing's carbon emissions will peak even sooner than expected.In a separate report released on Thursday, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) found China issued no new permits for coal-based steelmaking projects in the first half of 2024.CREA said that was the first time on a half-yearly basis that there have been no new permits since China announced its \"dual carbon goals\" in September 2020 -- a development hailed as a possible \"turning point\" by the independent research organisation.\"As China's steel demand peaks and more scrap becomes available, there is great potential to shift away from coal-based production, representing a significant opportunity for emissions reduction in the next 10 years,\" CREA's report said.Scientists say global warming makes extreme weather more frequent and intense.China has seen a summer blighted by searing heat in the north and torrential rain in the south.Its weather agency last week forecast very high temperatures to persist in the coming weeks under the impact of climate change.Heavy rains in the east and south have also triggered a string of deadly floods and landslides in recent weeks.",

            "articleBody": "India&rsquo;s power sector has seen rapid growth in recent years, with economic growth propelling power demand to record highs each year. The previous financial year witnessed demand growing over 8 per cent to a record 1622 billion units, according to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), ministry of power, government of India, while 2024 summer demand peak has already hit 250 GW, up from 243 GW in 2023 and 216 GW in 2022, as per the ministry of Power. The power sector focus of the Union Budget of July 2024 is likely to feature a continuation of the focus on renewable energy, which contributed 71 per cent of India&rsquo;s new capacity addition in FY24, as reported by an Economic Times article. In the last decade, India has successfully led a solar capacity addition program. According to a report by the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF), India&rsquo;s installed solar capacity has seen a record addition of 15 GW solar in FY24, driven by falling costs and robust government support. The government is expected to build on the interim budget&rsquo;s push to encourage rooftop solar through PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, which provides budgetary assistance for up to 3 kW solar power in each household. The pace of expansion needs to double if not treble for achieving 500 GW renewables target by 2030. New units commencing manufacturing by 31 Mar-2024 enjoyed concessional corporate tax rate of 15 per cent. Extending the sunset date of 31-Mar, 2024 by another 5 years could possibly boost the Renewables addition significantly. As per the CEEW-CEF report, the addition of onshore wind capacity has been comparatively muted, with 3 GW of addition in FY24. The challenges for this sector mainly come from absence of large domestic equipment ecosystem and project execution roadblocks faced by developers. The importance of onshore wind cannot be understated as it will be a critical component of any net-zero power grid given its higher energy output and availability through the day. Long-term support in form of innovative financial instruments like contracts for differences, etc. for integrating wind could improve the pace of capacity addition. Energy experts believe that nuclear power could be one of the foremost technologies that can viably lead the world to a net zero pathway. The high cost, longer gestation period and lack of institutional focus has been a reason for gradual progress in this area. Suitable budgetary provisions for hastening the progress in addition of nuclear power in India could provide a critical steer for this sector. India is on track to meet its target of a 50 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. It thus becomes imperative to support newer technologies that can provide reliable energy in a system where most generation comes from time- and weather- dependent sources. The 2023 budget recognised this need by allocating budgetary support of Rs.3,760 crore in viability gap funding for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). Power utilities too have realised the importance of storage and have driven in an exponential rise in BESS capacity under execution in India in the previous two quarters. The sector will now require further support to accelerate the entry of market participants and the development of a domestic supply chain. This may be in the form of supportive regulations ranging from GST input credit for renewable power supply for captive hydrogen production, rationalisation and reduction of GST rates, and customs duties.  Pumped Storage Plants are another form of energy storage, which offers India an added advantage of a fully domesticated supply chain. World over, these assets have been primarily added through federal routes considering the criticality of such assets for the energy security of the grid. This budget can provide such direction. As India&rsquo;s energy transition accelerates, it opens the door for sunrise technologies such as green hydrogen, and longer-duration energy storage systems. The government has already taken the first steps to operationalise the former through the National Green Hydrogen Mission.  While developing low-carbon assets for future is important, scaling the decarbonisation of existing infrastructure, especially in transport, buildings, and industries also needs to be prioritised. A budgetary allocation towards end user adoption of projects leading to significant carbon emissions reduction, especially for hard to abate sectors, would be a welcome. This may include provisions like green ammonia adoption in fertilizer sector, integration of green hydrogen in steel production, Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) adoption in cement industry, etc. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in EU and Clean Competition Acts in USA are useful examples of similar legislations.  The recent approval of Viability Gap Funding for 1 GW offshore wind is a promising step which will provide confidence to developers regarding the bankability of such projects. Longer duration energy storage systems with the ability to supply energy for 7-8 hours have achieved GW-scale in markets such as Europe and China and can supplement conventional fossil-fuel based power for long durations in non-solar hours. NTPC has recently taken India&rsquo;s first step here with a 600 kW/ 3000 kWh long duration storage tender, and the coming year may see an uptick in projects if further support is provided for this novel technology. Rising EV sales in the country is an encouraging trend. Continuation and furthering of the momentum created through Faster Adoption &amp; Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) will be helpful with a particular focus on inter-city e-buses and private bus segments, which forms majority of the emissions in this segment. Reduction of GST on EV charging services, reduction of customs duty and GST on battery pack/ module and other EV car components would also be a significant step in accelerating EV and stationary storage adoption. Sodium ion technology is gaining traction as a battery technology, both in EVs and stationary storage applications. Currently, there is no concession in the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) for cells other than lithium-ion cells, which benefit from a reduced 5 per cent BCD rate. Extending similar concessions to other Advance Chemistry Cells (ACC) would further support the industry's growth and technological diversification.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: In a significant push towards energy modernisation, the central government is gearing up to prioritize enhancements in the electricity sector with an emphasis on renewable energy sources in the upcoming 2024-25 budget. Deloitte India partner, Anujesh Dwivedi, said that the thrust will be on the localisation of the value chain, particularly in manufacturing for solar, hydrogen, and batteries, catalysed by global geopolitical developments post-COVID19.According to Dwivedi, \"The budget is expected to further fortify the government's commitment to these pivotal sectors by continuing to bolster local manufacturing capabilities that align with global energy transition trends.\"The government&rsquo;s upcoming fiscal policies are anticipated to target resilience in electricity infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of increased adverse weather events due to climate change. This includes substantial allocations aimed at the digital transformation of electrical grids to support the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and enhance capacity to handle rising peak demands.India, which achieved a notable milestone by adding 18 GW of solar capacity in FY24, faces the challenge of ramping up its annual renewable energy capacity to about 50 GW to meet a 2030 target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel generation. \"Expanding renewable capacity at this scale necessitates not just the continuation of existing initiatives but also an incremental push particularly towards corporate renewable energy contributions and offshore wind projects,\" stated Dwivedi.The budget is also expected to focus on emerging new energy technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), green hydrogen, and Nuclear Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). These sectors are considered critical for bolstering India's energy security and reducing its dependency on fossil fuels.Dwivedi added, \"Investments in the upcoming budget will likely include significant support for enhancing transmission and distribution infrastructure. This will be complemented by strategic measures to digitize the grid, thus enabling it to handle the demands of a modern, more distributed energy system.\"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget for FY25 on July 23. The Budget session will commence on July 22 and conclude on August 12.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's battery energy storage capacity grew more than four-fold to 219 MWh as of March 2024, Mercom Capital said. As of March 2023, the overall battery energy storage capacity in India was at 47.6 megawatt hour (MWh), the US-based research firm said in its report on Wednesday.  Policy measures such as deviation settlement mechanism, grid connectivity regulations, and ancillary services regulations are being issued to ensure efficient renewable integration and grid stability, it said.  These measures are driving the demand for utility-scale energy storage, the report titled 'India's Energy Storage Landscape' said.  The Viability Gap Funding (VGF) programme aims to install 4 GWh of battery energy storage system (BESS), supported by a budget of Rs 37.6 billion (USD 452 million).  The VGF, energy storage obligations (ESO), and bidding guidelines for energy storage projects -- with or without renewable energy -- are boosting the country's pipeline of energy storage projects.  As per the report, India began adding energy storage capacity in 2013 with small pilot projects, and as of March 2024, the country's cumulative installed energy storage capacity stood at 219.1 MWh.  Of the installed capacity, 120 MWh alone was added in the January-March period this year.  Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, combined with BESS, accounted for 90.6 per cent of the total installed capacity.  \"India is an emerging market for energy storage, still in the early stages of development. Despite rapid growth in renewable energy, energy storage has lagged, which could potentially lead to curtailment and a lack of grid flexibility and stability.  \"To meet energy transition goals and manage the exponential increase in renewable energy, the government must prioritise energy storage to avoid issues faced by other countries with growing intermittent power but insufficient storage capacity,\" Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said.  The highest BESS capacity was installed in Chhattisgarh, accounting for 54.8 per cent of cumulative installed capacity, the report stated.  The country's operational pumped hydro storage capacity totalled 3.3 GW as of March 2024. Nearly 76 per cent of the country's operating capacity is in Telangana and West Bengal.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: E-commerce giant Amazon's overall emissions fell 3% last year as the company met a goal for all of the electricity it consumes globally to be matched with renewable power, it said on Wednesday. The power used and emissions created by technology giants are under scrutiny as the growth of AI increases electricity consumption. Amazon has a goal to reach net zero carbon by 2040 and in 2019 set a target to match 100% of its electricity consumption with renewable power by 2030 which it has now met. Amazon's total emissions were 68.82 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2023, down from 70.74 million tons the previous year, it said in its annual sustainability report. Amazon's total emissions include those generated from its supply chain, third party logistics and purchased electricity. Emissions from the company's direct operations, rose 7% to 14.27 million tons which Amazon said was due to an increase in the number of packages delivered by its in-house logistics team and overall business growth. This figure also includes its data centres. \"We know generative AI requires a lot of computing power. To power this demand while still progressing toward our climate goals, we'll need different sources of energy than we'd originally projected,\" Chris Roe, Amazon's Director, Worldwide Carbon said via email. Amazon invested in 112 new renewable projects last year and is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable electricity in the world according to Bloomberg NEF. It said it also sometimes purchases renewable energy credits to bridge the gap between the time a renewable energy project is being built and when operations begin but did not say how many were used to meet the target. To date Amazon has invested in more than 500 wind and solar projects globally representing 28 gigawatts of capacity, it said. ",

            "articleBody": "BEIJING: China's industry ministry issued draft rules on Tuesday tightening investment regulations for solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing projects as it looks to pare back overcapacity. Projects will need to have a minimum capital ratio of 30% under the new rules. Previously, that minimum applied to polysilicon manufacturing projects while the minimum for other PV projects was 20%. The ministry did not provide a definition of the ratio, which typically refers to the percentage of total investment shareholders invest with their own assets. However, MIIT said the guidelines were intended to direct the development of the industry and would not be binding in project approvals. \"Overall, we think this is a very small step in the right direction. Looking ahead, whether relevant government authorities in China will follow up with more concrete supply side policies will be key to watch,\" said Albert Miao, head of HK China energy transition and commodities research at Macquarie Capital. \"For now, market-driven supply cut across the solar supply chain will be key to rebalance the market and push prices higher.\" The regulations also lay out minimum efficiency levels for different types of solar panel technologies. The goal is to limit further expansion of manufacturing capacity, pare back outdated capacity and accelerate sector consolidation, said Jessica Jin, principal research analyst for solar PV at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. \"The policy direction is to control expansion pace through regulations on quality capacity,\" Infolink analyst Amy Fang said, pointing to the standards for efficiency as well as for energy consumption. Including plans for new plants announced this year, China by some estimates has enough capacity to meet global demand until 2032. That has led prices to fall below cost level, in some cases, and hurt sector profitability. The rule applies to both new construction and expansion projects. The comment period for the draft rule will run until July 15, according to a notice on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's (MIIT) website. MIIT said the aim is to strengthen management of the PV industry and accelerate upgrading and structural adjustments. The draft rule also said that registered companies' annual expenses for research and development and process improvement should be at least 10 million yuan ($1.38 million), and no lower than 3% of overall sales, in line with existing guidelines.",
