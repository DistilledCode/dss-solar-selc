        "articleBody": "India's warehousing sector is seeing increasing adoption of solar power, driven by cost savings, environmental benefits as well as supportive government policies.The move towards renewable energy is not just a response to global environmental concerns but also a strategic business decision for many warehouse operators seeking to reduce operational costs and enhance sustainability.Warehousing developers and operators, including Allcargo Group, Horizon Industrial Parks, Mahindra Logistics, Amazon India, and Flipkart, are incorporating solar energy into their logistics facilities and supply chain infrastructure.For instance, logistics player Allcargo Gati has solarised more than 10 facilities spread across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab. The company has a total footprint of 10 million sq ft. We aim to enhance solar capacity by solarising an additional five locations in Bhiwandi, Nagpur, Bengaluru, Indore and Farukhnagar by next year,  said Sushil Kumar Rathi, director, Allcargo Supply Chain, an Allcargo Group company.  This will add 500 kWp of solar capacity to our existing installed capacity of over 680 kWp. The group's solarisation initiatives are a testament to its vision of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040. These moves not only indicate the feasibility of solar power in warehousing but also set a precedent for others in the industry.  111386056Blackstone's logistics platform Horizon Industrial Parks has also taken steps in making rooftop solar power available at all operational parks. It has current operational and near-term planned capacity of more than 25 MW across 12 operational parks and it plans to add at least 10 MW of solar capacity annually. Currently, 20% of the total energy consumption requirements of the tenants at Horizon Industrial Parks is met by solar energy. We expect this to increase to 30-35% in the next 12-18 months, and our endeavour will be to increase it further, subject to favourable state-level renewable energy policies,  said Urvish Rambhia, principal at Blackstone Real Estate India.According to him, by providing customers with on-site solar rooftop power, Horizon Industrial Parks hopes to contribute to a large part of their renewable energy requirement at its sites. Horizon Industrial Parks, along with its affiliates, manages 24 industrial and logistics parks spread across over 1,700 acres, and with an area of 42 million sq ft, which are in 10 key markets in India.The government has been promoting renewable energy through incentives and policies. Programmes like the National Solar Mission aim to establish India as a global leader in solar energy. Subsidies, tax breaks and grants are available for businesses that invest in solar power, making it a financially viable option.Additionally, some states offer net metering policies, allowing businesses to sell excess power back to the grid, further enhancing the financial benefits.A primary motivator for the shift in warehouses is cost savings. Warehouses, which typically have large, flat rooftops, are ideal for installing solar panels.Adopting solar power aligns with the broader corporate responsibility initiatives that many companies are now prioritising.",

The new initiative will add to the state's ongoing programmes and schemes to boost generation and use of solar energy.  The campaign will be based on the Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) module. In line with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's vision, the Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Agency (UPNEDA) has begun implementing the action plan, according to an official statement.  The state government has allocated Rs 2 crore for the two months long campaign and started the process of roping in an agency to manage and execute the initiative.  Initially, UPNEDA will run the campaign in three major cities, including Ayodhya, Varanasi, and Gorakhpur, to increase public awareness and acceptance of the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Yojana and boost the number of beneficiaries under this scheme, the statement said.  The promotional activities will include displaying banners, installing billboards at strategic locations, setting up booth camps, and distributing pamphlets during various events at universities, colleges, and schools.  Besides, UPNEDA will also use radio and newspaper advertisements in Ayodhya, Gorakhpur, and Varanasi.  Ayodhya and Varanasi are already being developed as solar cities, and this comprehensive campaign will now pave the way for increased awareness and promotion of solar energy in Gorakhpur as well, the statement said.  According to officials, a solar city could fulfil at least 10 per cent of its energy demand through solar power.",

        "articleBody": "Adani group is looking to invest about Rs 2 lakh crore by 2030 to build 40 gigawatts of renewable energy generation capacity, as it targets net zero emissions across businesses by 2050, top officials said on Tuesday. The apple-to-airport conglomerate currently has over 10 GW of capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources like sunlight and wind energy and is looking to add 6-7 GW every year to reach 50 GW by 2030.  Considering the ballpark number of Rs 5 crore per megawatt, the investment could be in the range of Rs 2 lakh crore by 2030,  Adani Green Energy Ltd Executive Director Sagar Adani told reporters here. Its CEO Amit Singh said the company would also build a 5 GW pump storage capacity to peak power demand during the night when sunlight is not available, and wind intensity is not strong enough to turn wind turbines to produce electricity. The carbon credits renewable capacity generates, together with a few other measures, will help turn the group net zero by 2050.111239657AGEL added 2.8 GW capacity in the 2023-2024 (April 2023 to March 2024) fiscal, which was 15 per cent of India's total renewable energy capacity addition, Singh said.  This year, our target is 6 GW,  he said. Going forward, that kind of capacity addition or higher is likely every year, Adani said, adding that 80 per cent of the 50 GW capacity will be solar and the rest wind. The conglomerate is building factories to make wafers used in solar panels to generate electricity and wind turbines. Singh said the group is now looking at making 3 MW wind turbines for areas with lower wind speeds. It currently makes wind turbines of 5.2 MW capacity that are suited for high-potential areas like Khavada in Gujarat. India is the world's third-largest economy in terms of energy needs, and its energy demand is projected to surge 25-35 per cent by 2030. Its peak energy demand is estimated to be 366.4 GW by 2031-32. AGEL brought on a stream of 2,848 MW (2.8 GW) renewables capacity, the largest greenfield expansion in India's renewable energy sector. This included 2,418 MW solar and 430 MW wind projects.111119307Of the capacity commissioned in FY24 includes 2,000 MW of solar capacity from Adani Green Energy's World's largest renewable energy project of 30,000 MW, being built at Khavda, Gujarat. The project is spread across 538 square kilometres, almost five times the city of Paris. Once built, it will be the largest power plant in the world, regardless of the energy source. AGEL is also targeting the addition of at least 5,000 MW pumped storage project (PSP) capacity by 2030 in the first phase, Singh said. It has begun the construction of the first 500 MW PSP in Andhra Pradesh. The company has a robust development pipeline of hydro-pumped storage projects across Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. With this, AGEL has revised its renewable energy target to 50,000 MW from 45,000 MW by 2030. AGEL's current operational portfolio is 10,934 MW, which consists of 7,393 MW solar, 1,401 MW wind and 2,140 MW wind-solar hybrid capacity. It is the first company in India to surpass the 10,000 MW renewable energy capacity.111130859Over the past five years, its operational capacity addition has outpaced the industry, achieving a CAGR of 41 per cent compared to India's 13 per cent. AGEL's total locked-in portfolio stands at 21,953 MW (10,934 MW is operational, and 11,019 MW is under execution). About 93 per cent of AGEL's portfolio comprising 20,368 MW is now backed by 25-year fixed tariff PPAs with sovereign/sovereign equivalent counterparties, which gives it revenue predictability, and 7 per cent is merchant portfolio, offering higher realisations.",

        "articleBody": "India expects a surge in domestic solar cell-making capacity in the coming months, which will help reduce its dependence on imported materials from China to manufacture solar panels, the country\u2019s top renewable energy official said. The nation\u2019s cells capacity is set to jump five-fold to about 30 gigawatts a year by March 2025, Renewable Energy Secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said in an interview in New Delhi. This will allow the government to widen import restrictions aimed at boosting local adoption of solar power hardware and achieving Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s goal of increasing self-sufficiency in the sector.In a bid to wean itself off Chinese imports, India has levied taxes on some solar components and introduced a so-called approved list of models and manufacturers, a non-tariff trade barrier that\u2019s essentially meant to keep foreign shipments out. US and European officials have also complained that a flood of new supply from Chinese solar companies has overwhelmed global demand and is stymieing efforts to develop their own supply chains. The Biden administration last month issued a suite of rules strengthening tariffs against Chinese solar equipment.But while India\u2019s domestic module output has already picked up thanks to existing import curbs, manufacturers continue to rely on China for other back-end products that go into making solar panels.Cells, another component, will be the next item to be restricted, though the government will be more cautious this time around, according to Bhalla.\u201cWe plan to give the industry around two years time to prepare so that we have ample domestic capacity,\u201d Bhalla said. \u201cIt should be a firm, forward-looking policy.\u201dThe government had to temporarily withdraw the non-tariff import restriction on modules last year after the local industry complained that tightening supplies were disrupting projects. Manufacturers are also hoping for higher domestic demand before committing to new capacities, according to Rohit Gadre, a BloombergNEF analyst based in Mumbai. \u201cIn absence of adequate local demand, manufacturers will be looking out for strong growth in the export markets for cells and modules made in India,\u201d Gadre said.",

About 90 per cent of the respondents of 'Solar Spectrum of New India' survey acknowledge the need for specialized skills in solar panel installation, and 45 per cent believed skilled labour is unavailable locally.   The top barriers to the adoption of solar power in India are shortage of specialized skills, perceived cost implications and accessibility,  it said.  The study further said that around 59 per cent respondents have concerns over high initial installation costs.   A noteworthy proportion believe that the cost of implementing solar power solutions is slightly more compared to traditional energy sources,  it said.  This suggests the need to build awareness of financial schemes and avenues available for consumers who are prepared to adopt such solutions but refrain due to reservations about the cost.

The power transmission and distribution vertical of L&T has secured the order, the company said in a BSE filing.  The solar project at Kajra village in Lakhisarai district of Bihar will be a key element in the state's plans to harness renewable energy for sustainable energy solutions towards combating climate change and meeting demand growth.  The battery energy storage system will store solar energy during low-demand periods and discharge it when demand peaks.  In addition, it will help handle fluctuations in generation, provide frequency regulation, and support voltage. It comes with black start capability to the grid that will facilitate quick re-energisation after an outage.  Larsen & Toubro is a USD 27 billion Indian multinational enterprise engaged in engineering, procurement and construction projects, hi-tech manufacturing and services, operating across multiple geographies.",

The solar project, approved by the State Cabinet on August 19, 2022, is projected to produce 50 million units of electricity every year and its construction is expected to be completed by July 2025.Speaking at a public meeting at Namrup that was held in connection with the foundation stone laying ceremony, Sarma said when he was sworn-in as Chief Minister in 2021, the peak-hour demand of electricity in the State stood at 1800 Mw but the same has now increased to 2500 MW owing to the increased number of industries andelectrification of unelectrified villages across the State.110932478The State, on its own produces a mere 419 MW power resulting in purchase of around 2100 Mw of power daily, he said. Initiatives such as the solar power project at Namrup will augment the State\u2019s power generation capacity and will contribute greatly towards reducing reliance on power purchased from outside the State, he added. Stating that till date, a total of seven solar power projects are functional in the State, the Chief Minister said this account for 175 MW of daily power generation.He further added that the upcoming power plants in Sonitpur district\u2019s Barchalla and Dhubri district\u2019s Khudigaon are at various stages of development and that the construction of a 1,000-MW capacity solar power plant at Karbi Anglong will begin shortly. The 120-Mw Lower Kapili Hydropower project, on the other hand, has started yielding electricity, the Chief Minister said, exuding confidence the State will be able to produce around 3,000-MW of solar generated electricity by 2030.110916747Referring to the Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana that was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister appealed to the eligible households of the State to opt for it to bring down their power consumption expenses.",

        "articleBody": "You\u2019ve heard of Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell Plc, BP Plc, TotalEnergies Se, ConocoPhillips and Eni SpA? How about Tongwei Co., GCL Technology Holdings Ltd., Xinte Energy Co., Longi Green Energy Technology Co., Trina Solar Co., JA Solar Technology Co., and Jinko Solar Co.?If the former names are familiar giants and the latter obscure, you might want to rethink how you look at the companies that provide the world with energy. On a reasonable accounting of things, the latter are just as significant \u2014 if not more so \u2014 than the powerhouses of petroleum.That\u2019s a remarkable shift. Around the middle of the 20th century, the predecessors of the major international oil companies attained such power that they were nicknamed the Seven Sisters, a group of energy producers with such global scope and influence that they could make or break governments. It took a wave of nationalizations and the 1973 oil crisis to end that model. A further disruption is now waiting in the wings, thanks to the unstoppable rise of China\u2019s solar power sector.The best way to think about this is to consider what oil companies ultimately provide the world. It\u2019s not really crude or natural gas, but the vital ingredient locked up in the chemical bonds of those hydrocarbons: energy. The manufacturers of solar equipment, similarly, aren\u2019t in the final analysis providing us with panels of silicon and glass, but machines that can harvest power from the sun. The activities of each group of companies provide a fresh flow of useful energy to the world every year. And by many measures, the solar companies have already overtaken Big Oil.   110988776To see how, you can start by converting the barrels of crude and cubic meters of gas produced by the big petroleum companies into a measure of energy \u2014 exajoules. An exajoule of electricity would be able to power Australia, Italy or Taiwan for a year. And the big oil companies are making a lot of it: About 8.3 EJ annually for ExxonMobil and 6.2 EJ at Shell. The vast majority of that is wasted, however. Only about a fifth of the chemical energy in freshly pumped crude ends up being turned into kinetic energy moving cars and trucks, because oil refineries and vehicle engines fritter most of it away as useless heat and noise. Gas turbines are a bit more efficient at turning methane into power, but still end up operating at about one-third efficiency once you account for losses from gas well to electrical socket. At a rough estimate, only about a quarter of the energy coming out of an oil company\u2019s wells gets turned into useful power.   110988794We can do a similar transformation with solar. Companies such as Tongwei, GCL or Xinte that produce the polysilicon raw material for solar panels measure their output capacity in metric tons per year. It\u2019s a simple process to convert that into gigawatts of the solar cells made by Longi, Jinko and the like, and ultimately into the exajoules that the resulting panels will generate. Put the two side by side, and the result is striking. The biggest polysilicon producers right now can go head-to-head with some of the biggest oil companies such as BP, Eni and ConocoPhillips \u2014 and panel makers aren\u2019t far behind. Should Tongwei go ahead with plans announced in December to build a 400,000 ton polysilicon plant in Inner Mongolia, nearly doubling its current output, it might overtake even ExxonMobil:   110988803That still understates things. An oil company is ultimately developing reserves of petroleum that can keep producing for a decade or so into the future. A manufacturer, similarly, is building a factory that can churn out similar volumes year in, year out, until the equipment is worn out or obsolete.If you consider what each group of companies can produce without major additional investments \u2014 comparing the volumes in oil firms\u2019 geological reserves to what solar companies will be able to produce before depreciation wears out their plant \u2014 clean power moves clearly into the lead:   110988813That\u2019s still forgetting one more crucial factor. A solar panel sold by Longi in 2024 will be generating electricity for decades. Most carry 25-year warranties. Oil and gas sold this year, however, will almost all be used up in a matter of months. If you look at the long-term flow of energy into the global economy that\u2019s crystallized with each solar cell produced, it\u2019s many times what\u2019s being provided by Big Oil:   110988821Any comparison between oil and solar can be criticized for comparing apples with oranges \u2014 but if you buy apples and oranges you\u2019ll often get a label telling you how many kilojoules they contain, and we should do doing the same for the exajoules provided by oil and solar businesses. Fruit, fuel and electricity all ultimately provide a measurable flow of energy. Since the first industrial revolution raised coal-rich Britain, Germany and the US to dominance, and the rise of crude brought power and wealth to Russia and the Middle East while extending America\u2019s global lead, the nations that controlled the headwaters of these energy flows have been the hegemons of each succeeding century.Right now, seven Chinese companies have a bigger stake in the power source of the 21st century than the Seven Sisters of oil that dominated the 20th. If you want to understand the roots of the geopolitical angst driving Washington\u2019s crackdown on China\u2019s clean technology, it\u2019s impossible to ignore that fact.",

        "articleBody": "Installing rooftop solar panels in Delhi is set to get easier as the state government has launched a dedicated portal to guide people on installing rooftop solar units. The portal will soon have a list of authorized vendors as well. The portal will also feature a shadow area assessment process to optimize panel placement and a solar capacity calculator for households.Notified in March this year, the Delhi Solar Energy Policy 2023 seeks to boost rooftop solar capacity. It offers multiple benefits, including state capital subsidies and generation-based incentives alongside central financial assistance (CFA).Under the policy, all residential projects will receive a capital subsidy of Rs 2,000 per kW, capped at Rs 10,000 per consumer. As generation-based incentives, the government will pay Rs 3 per unit for additional power for plants up to 3 kW and Rs 2 per unit for plants between 3-5 kW for five years, provided certain conditions are met. Unlike the 2016 scheme, there is no minimum production cap to receive this payment.The installation process, as detailed on the portal, begins with consumers registering on the national solar portal and then on the national rooftop solar portal to avail CFA under the PM Suryaghar Muft Bijli scheme. Consumers will need to log into their accounts and submit an application for a rooftop solar (RTS) system. Following this, the concerned discom will conduct a technical feasibility check before issuing an approval letter via email.Consumers can then approach any registered vendor within their discom\u2019s jurisdiction to submit detailed system information to the power distributor. Upon completing the installation, they must submit installation documents to both the discom and the national portal.After a site inspection, the discom will install a net meter and a solar meter at the location, enabling the system to be energized. Once the discom updates the net meter installation details on the national portal, an online commissioning certificate will be generated and visible on the consumer\u2019s account. The national subsidy, CFA, will be credited to the consumer\u2019s registered bank account within 30 days of submitting the account details.An official also stated that consumers with roof access and the financial means to purchase an RTS system can directly approach a solar vendor.For those with roof constraints, there is an option to buy a share in a third-party-owned solar system under the community solar model. Consumers can also band together to install a collectively-owned solar plant on a participating consumer\u2019s rooftop. In such cases, the electricity exported to the grid will be pro-rata credited into the participating consumers' electricity bills based on their ownership share.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Open access solar installations rose two-fold in India to 1.8 gigawatts during January-March this year supported by several factors, including reduced module cost, US-based Mercom Capital has said. Solar power through open access is an arrangement where a power producer establishes a solar power plant to supply green energy to consumers.  India added over 1.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar open access capacity in the first quarter of the calendar year of 2024, posting a two-fold increase from 909.3 megawatts (MW) in Q4 2023, the report titled 'Mercom India Solar Open Access Market' said.  As of March 2024, the cumulative installed solar open access capacity stood at 14.3 GW.  Solar open access developers benefited from lower Chinese module prices and the suspension of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) order for projects commissioned through March 2024.  Additionally, lower power purchase agreement (PPA) prices, due to reduced project costs, further incentivized consumers to adopt solar open access.   Demand for green energy open access, especially solar, has been mounting, driven by the financial savings and initiatives to add renewable energy in the power procurement mix.   An additional push comes from the corporates leading climate change mitigation strategies. If not for the regulatory restrictions, green energy open access could be the driving force that helps India meet its non-fossil fuel targets,  said Priya Sanjay, Managing Director at Mercom India.  In Q1 2024, Rajasthan led solar open access capacity additions, accounting for almost 28 per cent followed by Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra with 21 per cent and 12 per cent of capacity additions, respectively.  The pipeline of solar open access projects under development and in the pre-construction phase was over 18 GW as of March 2024. Almost 74 per cent of pipeline projects were in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.",

        "articleBody": "More money is pouring into solar power than all other electricity sources combined, with investments set to reach half a trillion dollars this year, the world's top energy research body said Thursday.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast in a report that global investment in clean energy this year will hit $2 trillion, twice the amount going to fossil fuels.It said combined investment in renewable power and grids overtook the amount spent on fossil fuels for the first time in 2023. Clean energy investment is setting new records even in challenging economic conditions, highlighting the momentum behind the new global energy economy,  IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement accompanying the agency's annual World Energy Investment report.Companies and governments worldwide are raising spending on clean energy production to reduce the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels that are driving deadly climate change. The report said improving supply chains and lower costs were driving up investment in forms of so-called clean energy, which include solar panels, wind turbines, electric cars and heat pumps, as well as nuclear power generation.Combined investment in renewables and nuclear for electricity generation is now set to reach 10 times the amount going to fossil-fuel power, led by solar, with China investing the biggest share. More money is now going into solar PV (photovoltaic panels) than all other electricity generation technologies combined,  the report said.Solar panel costs have decreased by 30 percent over the past two years and in 2024  investment in solar PV is set to grow to $500 billion as falling module prices spur new investments. By comparison, global upstream oil and gas investment is expected to increase by seven percent in 2024 to reach $570 billion, following a similar rise in 2023.The IEA warned however of  major imbalances and shortfalls in energy investment flows in many parts of the world  where clean energy projects remain prohibitively expensive.Excluding renewable energy giant China, the $300 billion invested by emerging and developing economies remained  far below what is required to meet growing energy demand in many of these countries . More must be done to ensure that investment reaches the places where it is needed most,  Birol said. The IEA said that meeting medium-term global goals to reduce harmful carbon emissions would require investment in renewable power to be doubled worldwide by 2030.",

The non-solar hours demand was at an all time high of 234.3 GW the day before, the government said. The northern region achieved a record 'demand met', reaching an all-time high of 86.7 GW, while the western region touched 74.8 GW.Thermal generation achieves a peak of 176 GW, especially during non-solar hours. A key contributor for the generation was implementation of section 11 of the Electricity Act, which facilitated the maximization of generation from imported coal based plants and gas based plants, the ministry said. Support from renewable energy sources especially solar during solar hours and wind during non solar hours was significant in meeting the demand the government added. Peak power demand has been touching record highs this month led mailt.by cooling demand with major parts of the country reeling under heat wave and temperature reaching record highs. The last record of peak power demand was a day before at 246 GW. Last year, peak demand in May was 221 GW, as temperatures were lower than expected and there were fewer days of heatwave conditions.However in FY24 the peak demand was met in September at 243 GW.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Rooftop solar capacity installations in India registered a 26 per cent year-on-year decline to at 367 megawatts during January-March period, mainly on account of rise in input cost, according to Mercom Capital. The country had witnessed 485 megawatt (MW) of rooftop solar installations during the first quarter of 2023, the research firm said in a report on Friday.  India added 367 MW of rooftop solar in the March quarter. Installations fell nearly 10 per cent quarter-over-quarter from 406 MW and dropped over 24 per cent year-on-year from 485 MW, the report titled 'Q1 India Rooftop Solar Market' said.  India's cumulative rooftop solar capacity was 10.8 GW as of March 2024.   The drop in installations was largely a result of application processing delays faced by residential customers due to oversubscription under the PM SURYA GHAR: MUFT BIJLI YOJANA programme. The rise in module prices to comply with domestic content requirements (DCR) further contributed to reduced capacity additions under the SURYA Gujarat program,  it said.  The industrial segment led quarterly capacity additions, comprising almost 57 per cent of installations. Commercial, residential, and government segments accounted for around 28 per cent, 14 per cent, and 1.1 per cent of capacity additions, respectively.  Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said,  Although rooftop solar is off to a slow start, 2024 could be a breakout year if the government's residential rooftop programme with attractive incentives. The challenge is on the supply side, a short supply of inverters and certain components, availability of skilled labor, and concerns over the ability of installers and government agencies to handle the rush is keeping the sector up at night.   Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Kerala, and Karnataka led in the rooftop solar additions in the quarter. The top-five states accounted for more than 67 per cent of the quarter's installations.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Gentari Sdn Bhd, the renewable energy arm of Malaysian energy giant Petronas, is the frontrunner for a part of the India renewable portfolio of Brookfield Asset Management, said two people aware of the development. Gentari, which has conducted due diligence of the assets, has signed an exclusivity agreement for further negotiations with Brookfield, they said.Government-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is another contender that has completed due diligence, said people with knowledge of the matter. The 2 GW renewable portfolio of Brookfield in India that\u2019s up for sale has an estimated enterprise value of $800 million-1 billion (Rs 6,600-8,300 crore). Other entities that had submitted initial bids but are no longer in the race include Sekura Energy, Sembcorp and UAE's Masdar Energy, they said.Of the portfolio, 1 GW is operational and projects with a capacity of 1 GW are under construction, expected to be completed within 18 months, said the people cited.Five years after entering the renewable energy sector in India, Canadian investor Brookfield Asset Management is looking to partially monetise its assets, having hired investment bank JP Morgan to run the sale process, ET was first to report in February. Brookfield has about 20 GW of wind and solar assets in operation or in the development pipeline across India. 110508907The holdings that will be divested include capacities of 500 MW in Rajasthan, 50 MW in Gujarat, 300 MW in south India and 80 MW in Madhya Pradesh. A Brookfield spokesperson declined to comment. Gentari and ONGC didn\u2019t respond to queries.Brookfield entered the Indian renewables space in 2019 with the acquisition of wind farms from Hyderabadbased Axis Energy Ventures for Rs 500 crore. It also picked up 51% in CleanMax Enviro in 2023, with an equity investment of Rs 3,000 crore. In 2022, Brookfield monetised its road portfolio by selling it to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in a deal valued at Rs 9,375 crore ($1.2 billion at the time).Gentari, which operates locally through Gentari Renewables India, has been aggressively looking for buyout opportunities in the country. Last month, Finnish firm Fortum signed an agreement to sell a 43.75% stake in its 185 MW solar power portfolio in India to Gentari Renewables India.In October 2023, Gentari invested $1.5 billion for a 30% stake in AM Green Ammonia Holdings BV (AMG Ammonia), a green ammonia platform of AM Green set up by Greenko Energy Holdings, a renewable energy company. Gentari also owns Amplus Solar, with a portfolio of more than 1.4 GW of distributed solar assets serving over 300 companies in the commercial and industrial sector.In July 2023, Gentari and renewable energy provider ReNew Energy Global formed a joint venture with 5 GW of renewable capacity in India. The collaboration follows Gentari's initial investment for a 49% equity stake in ReNew's 403 MW Peak Power project in May. Similarly, ONGC is also exploring buyout opportunities in the clean energy space as part of decarbonising its operations. ONGC plans to have a 10 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030 with an investment of Rs 1 lakh crore. In February, the company set up ONGC Green for its renewable operations.ONGC\u2019s total installed capacity of renewable energy as of March 2023 was 189.53 MW \u2014 36.52 MW of solar energy and 153 MW of wind energy. ONGC is in talks to form a consortium with NTPC Green Energy to bid for National Investment and Infrastructure Fund-owned Ayana Renewable Power, ET reported a week ago.Brookfield is one among the early infrastructure investors in India. Since 2014, Brookfield has deployed about $25 billion in the country, including a Rs 25,215 crore investment in Jio Towers, a Rs 21,000 crore deal to buy ATC India and a Rs 13,000 crore buyout of East-West Pipeline (formerly Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure).India has attracted investments of Rs 1.32 lakh crore in the renewable energy sector in the past three years. Installed renewable energy capacity is expected to increase to about 170 GW by March 2025 from 132 GW in October 2023, according to research agency Icra.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The National Capital Regional Transport Corporation (NCRTC) on Monday said the 2.21 megawatt peak (MWp) of in-house solar power generation across the RRTS corridor is contributing to save over 2,300 tons of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) annually. According to a statement, the NCRTC has taken significant strides in embracing renewable energy through its widespread adoption of solar power infrastructure along India's first Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor. By installing solar panels on the rooftops, the NCRTC has transformed its stations, depots and receiving substations into centres of clean and sustainable energy.   Currently, 2.21 MWp of in-house solar power generation across the RRTS corridor is contributing to savings of over 2,300 tons of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) annually,  it said in a statement.  The solar power plants are now operational at the Guldhar and Sahibabad RRTS stations, each having a peak power capacity of 729 kilowatts (kWp), as well as at the Duhai Depot and Duhai Depot station with capacities of 585 kWp and 108 kWp respectively, it said.  Murad Nagar Receiving Sub Station (RSS) with a capacity of 43 kWp and the Ghaziabad RSS with a capacity of 20 kWp also generate solar power. Installation at other stations are also in progress, the statement said.  Upon reaching the targeted 11 MW solar power capacity, the NCRTC expects to save around 11,500 tons of CO2 emissions annually, representing a major step forward in the fight against climate change, it said.  The NCRTC's solar initiatives are in line with its solar policy adopted in March 2021, aiming to increase the share of renewable energy by generating more than 11 MW peak of solar power across its facilities, it stated.  The installation of solar power plants at Guldhar and Sahibabad stations, each equipped with 1,620 high-efficiency solar panels, exemplify the NCRTC's unwavering commitment to sustainability. These installations are projected to generate around 10 lakh units of electricity annually per station, the statement said.  The Guldhar station is expected to consume around five lakh units of electricity annually, while Sahibabad will utilise about 7.3 lakh units for auxiliary loads, rendering both stations  Carbon Negative  (generating more power than its requirements), it said.  Presently, a 34-km section between Sahibabad and Modi Nagar North of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor, which includes eight stations, namely Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai, Duhai Depot, Murad Nagar, Modi Nagar South and Modi Nagar North stations is operational for the passengers.  As construction progresses swiftly on the remaining stretches of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor, the NCRTC is expected to complete the entire system by the anticipated operational deadline of June 2025, it added.",

        "articleBody": "India achieved a milestone by adding over 10 GW of solar capacity in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, marking the highest quarterly installation to date.This figure represents an almost 400 per cent year-over-year (YoY) increase compared to the over 2 GW installed in Q1 2023, as per the recent Q1 2024 India Solar Market Update from Mercom India Research.Quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) capacity additions also saw a dramatic surge of 414 per cent, rising from nearly 2 GW in Q4 2023.In Q1 2024, India installed 9.7 GW of large-scale solar capacity, which included 1.8 GW from open access solar projects. This represents a 524 per cent QoQ increase and a nearly 534 per cent YoY rise.Priya Sanjay, Managing Director of Mercom India, said,  The surge in installations in Q1 2024 was driven by the commissioning of several delayed projects that had received extensions in previous quarters due to high module prices. Falling module prices and suspending the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) order enabled developers to import modules at lower costs, facilitating project completions. Several projects were commissioned early to take advantage of the ALMM order suspension.Additionally, granting grid connectivity to projects previously stalled in the Great Indian Bustard habitat significantly contributed to the record-breaking installations. There is a substantial pipeline of large-scale projects scheduled for 2024, positioning India for a record-breaking year by a significant margin. Assuming stability in policy and supply chains, and if government agencies continue to auction projects and meet the set targets, India is poised to be among the top three solar markets globally , commented Raj Prabhu, CEO at Mercom Capital Group.In Q1 2024, India added 15.2 GW of new power capacity, with solar power accounting for 66 per cent of these additions.Rajasthan and Gujarat led the large-scale solar installations, contributing 38 per cent and 35 per cent of the capacity additions, respectively, while Madhya Pradesh followed with 8 per cent.As of March 2024, India's cumulative installed solar capacity reached 82 GW. Solar energy represented 18.5 per cent of India's total installed power capacity and 43 per cent of the total installed renewable energy capacity.Rajasthan boasted the highest cumulative installed large-scale solar capacity, accounting for 29 per cent of the national total, followed by Gujarat and Karnataka at 14 per cent each.According to Priya Sanjay, Gujarat's proactive approach to renewable energy, especially with residential solar and wind-solar hybrid power projects, enabled it to overtake Karnataka.  Gujarat's foresight and supportive infrastructure and policies have attracted numerous large-scale projects.  she said.By the end of Q1 2024, India's large-scale solar project pipeline stood at 143.3 GW, with an additional 93.1 GW of projects tendered and pending auction. The average cost of large-scale solar projects fell by 7 per cent QoQ and 28 per cent YoY, significantly improving the projects' internal rate of return. The reduction in the average cost of large-scale solar projects is largely attributed to the falling prices of solar modules,  added Priya Sanjay.During the quarter, tenders totaling 30.7 GW were announced, up 122 per cent YoY and 92 per cent QoQ. Additionally, 25 GW of solar projects were auctioned, a 229 per cent QoQ increase and a 2,957 per cent YoY rise.Priya Sanjay noted that the surge in tendering activity was driven by agencies adhering to defined targets and timelines. Previously, delays in auctions and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signings deterred bidders as they led to funds getting locked up.However, streamlined auctions and attractive tariffs have revitalized the process, leading to quicker PPA signings and increased developer interest.Nonetheless, inadequate transmission infrastructure and land acquisition delays could hinder timely project commissioning.Developers are racing to complete projects before the June 2025 ISTS charges waiver deadline.Rising land costs and the scarcity of prime sites for solar could further complicate the landscape.

        "articleBody": "Orb Energy, a key player in the Indian solar power industry has launched its first 35 MW (DC) ground-mounted solar park in Arsikere in Hassan district, the company said on Tuesday. Spanning 110 acres and delivering 5.24 crore units of green power while reducing 45,000 tons of carbon dioxide every year, this solar park has been developed specifically to empower SMEs in the region, they said.  In a statement, the company said Orb Energy anticipates developing and commissioning approximately 400 MW of solar parks for SMEs across India by the end of the decade, with a projected investment of approximately Rs 2,000 crore over the same period.  With 27MW (DC) already commissioned across approximately 90 acres, Orb Energy projects the completion of its SME-centric solar park by the middle of the current financial year. Orb Energy's innovative solar park model allows enterprises to purchase plots and own their own solar sub-arrays within the overall park. This concept has been highly successful among SMEs in Karnataka,  it said. To further facilitate SMEs in owning their own portion of a solar park, the company said that it has also offered them access to its unique collateral-free, in-house financing facility. With a five-year tenor, Orb's in-house financing enables SMEs seeking off-site solar solutions to transition quickly and cost-effectively. According to the company, those who own an off-site solar system can expect reduced electricity costs of approximately 3.5-4.0 rupees per unit over the lifetime of their system, significantly lower than the current grid tariff rates of Rs eight - nine per unit. This arrangement benefits both discoms and enterprises by leveraging existing infrastructure for increased generation (thereby addressing growing electricity demand), while also enhancing SME competitiveness.  We could see that many SMEs with big power needs and limited roof space needed an off-site solar solution. That is why we launched a unique kind of solar park, enabling SMEs to buy their own plots and solar sub-arrays. This innovative approach has been embraced by SMEs across various industries, such as foundries, die-cast companies, precision components, malls, etc - empowering them to take control of their rising electricity bills and enhance their competitiveness,  Damian Miller, co-founder and CEO of Orb Energy said. The company is also planning its second solar park in Karnataka to further support their SME clients, he said.",

        "articleBody": "New York: A US company has become the world's most valuable solar manufacturer for the first time since 2018, as Chinese rivals suffer from a profit-slashing price war and an onslaught of trade barriers erected by Washington.First Solar Inc. gained 1.5% Friday to end trading with a market capitalisation of $21.15 billion. The move higher allowed the Arizona-based company to overtake Sungrow Power Supply Co., which saw its shares fall 4.2% Friday in Shenzhen to put its value at about $20.85 billion.It's the first time since 2018 a Chinese company hasn't been the most valuable solar equipment maker. The country dominates global production of panels, and controls more than 80% in every step of the supply chain.But China's build-up of factories has come at a cost as capacity has surpassed global demand, leading to falling prices and shrinking profit margins. Longi Green Energy Technology Co., another leading Chinese manufacturer, posted a net loss of 2.35 billion yuan ($325 million) in the first quarter after netting a profit of 3.64 billion yuan the same period of 2023.China's solar giants also are increasingly finding themselves in geopolitical crosshairs, with leaders from the US and Germany criticizing their overcapacity for stymieing the development of supply chains in other parts of the world. President Joe Biden this week announced higher tariffs on Chinese solar panels and other moves designed to bolster US manufacturers.First Solar, the biggest US panel manufacturer, is a prime beneficiary of those actions. It sells its panels in the US, where prices are almost triple the global average because of tariffs against Chinese products. And its expansion plans will be subsidized by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Of course, market capitalization is just one way to measure companies. By most other metrics, including the vital one of being able to produce enough clean energy to fight climate change, First Solar still has a way to go to catch up with its Chinese counterparts. It produced 12 gigawatts of panels in 2023, compared to 79 gigawatts for Shanghai-based Jinko Solar Co. ",

Through the national registration for solar pumps, farmers may be able to directly place their requirement to the vendors, eliminating the need for tendering of the pumps by states, the officials said.110186947The PM-KUSUM scheme has three components - setting up of 10,000 MW of solar power units, installation of around 2 million stand-alone solar agriculture pumps and solarisation of 1.5 million agriculture pumps. The rationalisation is being discussed for installation and solarisation of agricultural pumps. No change in the subsidy outlay is being discussed, two of the officials said, adding that the government would, however, keep a benchmark for the subsidy outgo. The Centre's outlay in the scheme for all three components is earmarked at \u20b934,422 crore for all three components. The subsidy under the PM-KUSUM scheme for solar pump installations and solarisation component is 30% by the Centre and minimum 30% from the states. How the state's subsidy will be integrated in the national portal is being worked out, said one of the officials.  We can build in the state subsidy component also on the portal, along with the Centre's,  the official said. The PM Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojana which has a target of installing rooftop solar units for 10 million households has received more registrations than envisaged and more than 800,000 applications so far, officials said.",

The renewable energy ministry recently shifted to a new portal and will soon start the national vendor registration process. The PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, which has an outlay of Rs 75,021 crore, entails implementation through power distribution companies and vendors with rationalised subsidies and collateral-free loans. Registrations under the scheme crossed the 10-million mark within a month of its launch. Of the registered consumers, almost 800,000 have applied for installations.",

The program provides subsidies to install grid-connected systems, allowing households to reduce electricity bills and sell extra power to the grid. However, challenges remain, including difficulties with electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) and a lack of skilled workers.

        "articleBody": "Lakshmi Narayan was one of the first to see the light: in 2020 the engineer put solar panels on his roof in India's Bhopal city, becoming a clean energy pioneer because of his desire to help his country move away from planet-heating fossil fuels.  I understand the importance of renewable energy and thought that everyone should adopt it,  said Narayan, 60, whose action inspired many others to do the same in the capital of Madhya Pradesh state in central India. Now, a new government scheme - unveiled before voting began in nationwide elections in April - aims to encourage more people to install solar panels on their roofs as part of India's commitment to triple renewable capacity by 2030. The new programme, launched in February, provides 75 billion rupees ($9 billion) in subsidies to install grid-connected rooftop solar systems on around 10 million homes, allowing consumers to reduce their electricity bills when the sun shines and sell extra units to the grid to earn some money. It is expected to create 30 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity in homes, leading to a reduction of 720 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent planet-heating emissions over the 25-year lifespan of the rooftop systems.  I want three things. Every household's power bill should be zero; we should sell surplus electricity and earn money; and I want to make India self-reliant in the energy sector as we transition to the era of electric vehicles,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a televised interview in late April. The process, which was previously complicated and fragmented, has been simplified with the creation of a one-stop online portal to smooth applications and facilitate installations. Subsidies are deposited directly into people's bank accounts. India overtook Japan to become the third-largest solar power generator in 2023, providing 5.9% of global growth in solar, a report by think tank Ember said on May 8. But Ember noted that wind, solar and other low-carbon sources are not yet growing fast enough to meet India's rising electricity demand. The new rooftop solar programme is meant to boost that growth but Narayan's experience offers a cautionary tale. He says the new online portal will provide answers to a lot of the bureaucratic headaches that used to bedevil the process but, in his experience, the bigger challenge is getting the electricity distribution companies, or DISCOMs, on board. A December 2023 study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi-based think tank, said DISCOMs were supposed to provide seamless access and connectivity for rooftop solar systems to the national grid but that this was sometimes  in direct conflict with business interests of the companies . Narayan said that although he saved up to 250,000 rupees ($2,996) in electricity bills over three years thanks to his 6 kilowatt (KW) solar system, selling excess electricity to the grid proved to be problematic with debt-ridden DISCOMs proving ineffective partners.  The electricity distribution company charges me 8 rupees for each unit that I consume from the grid, but for the surplus solar electricity that I sell back to the grid, they pay me 1.5 rupees per unit. How is that fair?  And he said that the distribution company added a fixed charge of 500 rupees to his monthly bill after he installed the panels.  They said that this is the minimum amount we will charge you even if your bill is zero,  he said, adding that he got no answer when he enquired about the reason for the new tariff. DISTRIBUTION CHALLENGES, LACK OF SKILLSThe pledge to cut electricity bills by boosting the solar power sector was a key election promise from Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and reflects India's long-term commitment to boost renewables. In 2015, India promised to install 40 GW of rooftop solar capacity by 2022 but progress has been slow. By the end of 2023, it had only installed 11 GW, including 3 GW in homes with the rest in commercial or industrial properties. That original commitment has now been revised to 100 GW of rooftop solar installations by 2026, 40 GW of which would come from the residential sector alone. Energy experts say India's solar drive is hampered by fears of DISCOMs losing income, a shortage of skilled workers to make, install and service solar panels, and the proliferation of substandard products. Danish Ali, who has installed a 4 KW solar system on his roof in Lucknow in northern India, said another problem arose from the fact that the grid-connected solar systems cannot deliver power during outages unless they have a separate battery to operate them.  In areas where there are long power cuts, grid-connected systems will not work because they do not provide any power back-up,  the 50-year-old said. Ali has to endure up to two hours of power outages a few times a week during peak summer months when temperatures regularly rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). He said that adding a battery to the grid-connected system could solve the problem, but the government subsidy does not cover the installation of such hybrid systems. Shreya Mishra, CEO of Mumbai-based SolarSquare Energy, which installs solar panels and is one of India's largest rooftop solar companies, said the industry could be on the brink of a boom; in 2023, 150,000 rooftop systems were installed and there are plans to target 2.5 million houses this year, she said.  The programme has turned rooftop solar into a dinner table conversation that has turbocharged the consumer interest,  she said. But more training is needed for workers in these new green jobs and domestic manufacture of solar panels must also be ramped up, she added. The government says the new solar programme will create around 1.7 million direct jobs across various sectors, including manufacturing, logistics, sales, installation, operation, maintenance, and other services. An expert with a solar consultancy, who did not wish to be named, said that the relatively limited growth of home solar systems had already caused friction with DISCOMs.  Imagine millions of homes being hooked up to the grid and injecting their excess electricity in a system that is already facing so many technical losses,  the expert said, referring to losses caused by, for example, damage to transmission lines or electricity theft. For Narayan, solving distribution issues will be central to encouraging more people to switch to solar and install panels on their rooftops.  If the government can enable people to truly earn some money, not for show but justified money, with these rooftop systems, it will be a hit among customers. Who would not want it?  he said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Tata Power has planned a 66 per cent higher capital expenditure of Rs 20,000 crore in this fiscal compared to a year ago, which will mainly focus on projects supporting energy transition and India's net-zero emission target by 2070. During the year ended March 2024, the capex (capital expenditure) was around Rs 12,000 crore, the company's CEO Praveer Sinha said during a post earnings conference call.   This year we are targeting to spend around Rs 20,000 crore,  he said in reply to a question on company's planned capex.  Sharing the breakup of the investment plant, Sinha said about 50 per cent will be on renewables (projects). The remaining will be mix of transmission, distribution and conventional projects.  The company will fund the capex through internal accruals and some debt, Sinha said.  Tata Power on Wednesday posted an 11 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit to Rs 1,046 crore in the March 2024 quarter compared to the year-ago period, mainly on the back of higher revenues.  The consolidated profit stood at Rs 939 crore in the quarter ended on March 31, 2023, a BSE filing showed.  In the renewable energy segment, Tata Power's 4.3 GW Cell & Module manufacturing facility in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu has commenced production and commercially produced around 130 MW of modules.  During FY24, the company won two projects worth Rs 2,300 crore under Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) process -- the Interstate Transmission System (ISTS) - Bikaner III Neemrana II Transmission Ltd and the Intrastate Transmission Scheme in Uttar Pradesh through SPV Jalpura Khurja Power Transmission Ltd.  The company is on an accelerated growth trajectory of transitioning to green energy and aiming for around 70 per cent of capacity from non-fossil-based fuels by 2030.  As of March 31, 2024, the company has 4.5 GW of renewable capacity operational and another 5.5 GW of projects under implementation, taking the total green energy portfolio to over 10 GW.  The company has 6,277 Ckm (circuit kilometres) of transmission lines portfolio including 1,651 Ckm capacity in pipeline.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Rapid solar energy deployment in India pushed the country past Japan to become the world's third-largest solar power generator in 2023, according to a new report. The report by global energy think tank Ember said India ranked ninth in solar energy deployment in 2015. Solar produced a record 5.5 per cent of global electricity in 2023. In line with the global trend, India generated 5.8 per cent of its electricity from solar last year, as reported in Ember's  Global Electricity Review . Ember's Asia Programme director Aditya Lolla said,  Increasing clean electricity is not just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It is also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly-electrified economy and to decouple economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change.  Solar maintained its status as the world's fastest-growing electricity source for the 19th consecutive year, adding more than twice as much new electricity worldwide as coal in 2023. India saw the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 (+18 terawatt hour or TWh), behind China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh) and Brazil (+22 TWh). Together, the top four solar growth countries accounted for 75 per cent of growth in 2023. Ember said the global solar generation in 2023 was more than six times larger than in 2015. Solar's contribution to electricity generation in India increased from 0.5 per cent in 2015 to 5.8 per cent in 2023. According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA)  Net Zero Emissions  scenario, solar would increase to 22 per cent of global electricity generation by 2030. With electricity generation accounting for nearly half of India's annual carbon dioxide emissions (1.18 gigatonnes in 2023), accelerating the transition to cleaner generation sources is imperative for the country to meet both its developmental and climate goals. As part of its national plan to fight climate change, India has committed to achieving 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. At the United Nations' COP28 climate change conference in December last year, world leaders arrived at a historic agreement to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030. The IEA says tripling the global RE capacity and doubling energy efficiency are crucial to limiting the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a political target set in 2015 to prevent further worsening of climate impacts. India is one of the few countries planning to triple renewable capacity by 2030. According to Ember's analysis, annual capacity additions need to significantly increase for India to meet this capacity target.",

        "articleBody": "Plunging prices for solar panels, which have slashed profits across the sector, don\u2019t have much room to fall further, according to the chairmen of two of the industry\u2019s biggest firms.The current slump is \u201cirrational\u201d and there\u2019s only a small probability it will continue, Jinko Solar Co. Chairman Li Xiande said in a joint presentation hosted by the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Li answered written questions from investors at the event on Tuesday along with executives from other firms, including Trina Solar Co. and CSI Solar Co.The companies are trying to turn a corner after solar manufacturers saw profits vanish as a wave of new factories that were aimed at capturing a growing market came online in the past year. Instead, the new supply has overwhelmed demand, sending panel prices to record lows and annihilating margins.\u201cThe price of photovoltaic modules is currently at a low level, and there\u2019s limited room for further decline,\u201d Trina Chairman Gao Jifan said at the presentation.Solar module prices are at about half the level they were in March 2023, BloombergNEF data show. China, by far the world\u2019s largest market, is facing grid constraints that may slow new additions. Installations in March were 32% lower than the previous year, according to the National Energy Administration. Jinko still expects global demand for panels to rise 20% this year, which will help rebalance the market. The company has already increased its production schedule in the second quarter compared to the first, and is operating its most advanced production lines at high rates, Li said. Companies were also asked about overseas expansion plans, amid complaints from officials in the US and Europe that solar manufacturing overcapacity in China is stymieing efforts to develop supply chains elsewhere in the world. Trina said its 5-gigawatt module factory in Texas will start production in the fourth quarter. Jinko said the expansion of its Florida facility came online during the first quarter, and that it\u2019s already ordering equipment for another extension.CSI Solar played down the impact of a US ruling that could impose tariffs as high as 254% on solar cells and modules made by Chinese firms in Southeast Asia found to be circumventing existing import taxes. Most leading companies have expanded their production chains in the region in order to meet conditions exempting them from the duty, said Yan Zhuang, the company\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cRegarding the expiration of the US anti-circumvention exemption period for Southeast Asia, the industry has been anticipating it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe impact of this policy after the exemption period is over should not be significant.\u201dOn the WireChina is flooding the US with used cooking oil that the biofuel industry says may be tainted, hurting American farmers and President Joe Biden\u2019s push to promote climate-friendly energy.China\u2019s April price data are likely to show consumer prices ticking up and factory-gate price falls narrowing, according to Bloomberg Economics. China\u2019s recovery is still missing a critical growth engine \u2014 consumer spending.China\u2019s central bank topped up its gold reserves for an 18th straight month in April, although the pace of buying slowed in the face of record prices.China\u2019s Ganfeng Lithium Group Co. plans to pay about $408 million to buy out its partner in a lithium mine being developed in Mali.",

        "articleBody": "The Naveen Jindal group is finalising a Rs 15,000-20,000 crore investment plan for the development of renewable energy projects which could become a source of captive clean fuel for its expanding steelmaking operations, said people with knowledge of the matter.Jindal is the promoter of the listed Jindal Steel and Power, which has announced a major capacity expansion that could ramp up the group\u2019s steelmaking operations to around one and a half times the existing size before the close of 2025-26.As per the blueprint being finalised, the group wants to power the new steel capacity additions by creating 4 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power sources in-house within the next couple of years, said the people. This would help the group reduce carbon emissions and produce green steel, they said.The steel industry accounts for nearly 8% of the global carbon emissions and a large part of that emanates from the use of fossil fuel-based power sources.The new capacities are being planned under Jindal Renewable Power Private Limited, a group company, the people said.\u2018Bulk of Projects to be in Rajasthan & KarnatakaET\u2019s queries to Jindal Steel and Power did not elicit a response till press time.\u201cThey are doing this to be more ESG (environmental, social and governance) compliant, as investors are demanding that industrial companies focus on reducing carbon emissions,\u201d said a person briefed on the matter, who did not wish to be identified.  109541648Most of the renewable energy capacity will be created by developing solar and wind power projects for which sites have been identified and land acquisition is underway, according to people in the know. The bulk of the projects will be in Rajasthan and Karnataka, they said.The Naveen Jindal group has initiated the process for the purchase of machinery for the proposed renewable energy projects and discussions with a close group of financiers are also underway, the people said.In its latest investor presentation, Jindal Steel and Power highlighted that it would continue to invest primarily in India. Its focus area for investment would remain steel and ancillary businesses such as mines, ports and power, the company said, adding that it also planned to invest in green technologies to decarbonise its steel business. The group plans to ramp up steelmaking capacity to about 15 million tonnes per annum by 2025-26 from 9.6 million tonnes per annum in 2022-23, according to its investor communication.Most of the additional capacity is coming up in production of hot rolled and cold rolled steel which has wide applications, especially in the fast-growing automotive and construction sectors. For instance, India\u2019s highway construction of almost 10,000 kilometres per year requires large quantities of steel for building guard rails.Steel firms such as Tata Steel and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel have also announced the setting up of captive green power projects for turning carbon emission-free in their steelmaking process.",

The order practically crippled solar power units in a large area across Rajasthan and Gujarat, derailing the country's renewables goal.India has a target of raising its renewable energy capacity to 450 gigawatt (gw) by 2030.In the latest order, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra disapproved the 2019 order. In the order, passed on March 19, the ban was lifted for 77,000 sq kms, but was upheld for a 13,000 sq km area which is the Great Indian Bustard's core habitat.Most Great Indian Bustard deaths in the area reportedly occur as a result of coming into contact with power lines. The Supreme Court ban was imposed following an argument by environmentalist M K Ranjitsinh on the same.As of now, a new seven-member expert panel has been set up to examine the issue thoroughly and holistically. Its report is being sought by July 31.In an observation accompanying the judgment, the SC said:  India's commitment to promoting renewable energy sources, particularly in regions like Gujarat and Rajasthan, aligns with its broader sustainable development objectives.

Much of the addition will be at Khavda in Gujarat's Kutch district, where the capacity will be expanded to 30 GW from the current 2GW.Of the total investment plan around \u20b950,000 crore is for capacities beyond Khavda totalling around 6-7 GW, a company official said. The company's current total standing capacity comprises 7,393 MW of solar, 1,401 MW of wind and 2,140 MW of wind-solar hybrid. At the Khavda project, the world's largest renewable energy park, capacity will go up to 6 GW by the end of this fiscal year, Adani Green managing director Vneet Jaain said.  There are power purchase agreements for power from Khavda for Adani Green and there is a huge captive requirement of renewable power by group companies which Khavda can provide,  he added. Adani Green has a market capitalisation of more than \u20b9 3 lakh crore.Equipment ManufacturingAdani New Industries Ltd, a subsidiary of group flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd, which manufactures solar and wind energy equipment, is planning to spend more than \u20b930,000 crore by 2030 to expand capacity. The company is seeking to reach 5 GW of wind turbine manufacturing capacity by FY27 from 1.5 GW currently, said Jaain, who is also a director of this unit.On the solar modules manufacturing side, the company plans to add 10 GW capacity in the next three and a half years, he said.Regarding sourcing solar panels and modules from Adani New Industries by Adani Green, Jaain said the arm is a different unit and bears no direct correlation to sourcing for its generation unit.For some of the renewable energy capacity being developed by Adani Green, the restriction of the approved list of models and manufacturers is not applicable so materials can be sourced from anywhere, he said.In cases where the restriction is applicable and if in future no foreign companies are allowed, then like others, the company will also source modules locally, he added.",

Once completed, this will be the world's first fully integrated quartz-to-module manufacturing plant, and have a final capacity of 30 GW upstream and 20 GW downstream facilities. As per the company, the complete project is envisaged to be developed in phases over the next five years.The integrated project, would require 8,348 acres of land including ancillary industries, Township, Common Infrastructure such as roads and power, a desalination facility of 100 MLD plant, storage, etc., compulsory 33% green area and excludes land required for captive power generation.The land required for this project is being purchased and offered at full market value including service charges by APIIC/APMB as per the 'Land Acquisition for Others (LA)' norms, Indosol said.Indosol acquired the land in January this year, and commissioned the plant at a record time, the company added.The company plans to complete phase 1A of the project by December 2024, which will have manufacturing capacities for 500MW modules, 500MW Cells, and 500MW Ingot-wafer, providing direct employment to 800 people.The fully complete Phase 1 of the project, comprising around 5GW, will be completed by 2025 at an investment of Rs 15,000 crore. Additional production of 5GW of glass panels, one of the raw materials for the modules, will be produced internally. The company aims to achieve full capacity by 2028. Once the full scale of operations of our integrated project is achieved, Indosol Solar will have a positive economic impact on up to 100,000 people while creating direct and indirect employment for over 32,000 people in the state of Andhra Pradesh,  said Sharat Chandra, CEO of Shirdi Sai Electricals Limited, in a press release. Indosol Solar is one of the select companies in the country awarded projects under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme by Government of India (GoI). It has secured PLI for 10 GW under two tranches, worth Rs 5,170 crore from Government of India under the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India installed 20.8 GW of solar modules and 3.2 GW of cell manufacturing capacity in 2023, according to Mercom Capital. The country's cumulative solar module manufacturing capacity reached 64.5 GW, and solar cell manufacturing capacity 5.8 GW as of December 2023, the US-based research firm said in its latest report, State of Solar PV Manufacturing.   About 60 per cent of the installed module manufacturing capacity was equipped to manufacture solar modules in M10 and G12 wafer sizes,  the report said.  Monocrystalline modules accounted for 67.5 per cent of the country's module production capacity, followed by polycrystalline, tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), and thin film modules, Mercom said.  Module manufacturing capacity is projected to surpass 150 GW, and cell capacity is expected to reach over 75 GW by 2026, it said.   As Indian manufacturers continue to invest in expanding their solar panel production capacities, they need to carefully navigate through the complexities of geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. Cheaper Chinese products will continue to challenge the competitiveness of locally-produced modules,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.  A policy change in the US post-elections, could potentially shrink export opportunities, and demand for solar energy in India needs to ramp up significantly to consume the projected increase in module production in the coming three years, he added.  Gujarat led the country's photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing capacity, accounting for 46.1 per cent of solar modules.  Telangana accounted for 39 per cent of annual solar cell production capacity, the highest in the country as of December 2023.  Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu ranked second and third for solar module production capacities, accounting for 9.3 per cent and 7.6 per cent.  Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh were second and third, with solar cell production contributing 34.7 per cent and 13.9 per cent of total capacities in the country.  Tendering activity by various public sector and government entities to procure solar modules in 2023 was at 9.7 GW.  As per the report, India imported 16.2 GW of modules against 10.3 GW in 2022.  Domestic manufacturers exported 4.8 GW of solar modules in 2023 compared to 1.6 GW in 2022.  India imported 15.6 GW of solar cells in 2023 from 5.8 GW. India's solar cell exports reached 286.3 MW in 2023, up from 10 MW in 2022.",

Presently, EDF has a clean energy pipeline of 1 GW in India.EDF has hired Rothschild to run the sale process and feelers have been sent to global infrastructure investors such as KKR, Actis, CDPQ, Sembcorp as well as domestic players such as JSW, Torrent and Edelweiss Infrastructure-backed Sekura Energy, said the people cited above. Group's Net Debt at 54.4b in 2023  EDF did not respond to an email query till press time. The Indian renewable energy space has seen multiple assets on the block in the past 6-8 months.Canadian investor Brookfield put on sale its 2 GW portfolio in India, while British oil and gas giant Shell plans to offload a significant stake in 3 GW platform Sprng Energy. Italy's Enel plans to sell 750 MW operational assets in India.The people cited above said EDF is unlikely to sell its entire operational assets in India but will instead bring an investor by offloading about 50-70% assets and retain the remainder. A potential deal may value the total operational assets at \u20b93,000-3,500 crore (about $400 million), the people said.EDF Group's net debt totalled \u20b954.4 billion ($58.7 billion) as of 2023-end, reducing from the peak of \u20b964.5 billion ($69.6 billion) in the previous year. It swung to a net profit of \u20b910 billion in 2023, from a loss of 17.9 billion in 2022. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation stood at \u20b939.9 billion, compared to a loss of \u20b94.9 billion.EDF is wholly owned by the French government. It is one of the largest power utility companies and the operator of the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in Europe.Falling electricity prices are hindering EDF's negotiations with industrial customers for long-term supply contracts, threatening the conglomerate's financial health and ability to keep its aging nuclear plants running, Reuters reported in February. Corrosion problems, maintenance and technical issues had forced EDF to close several of France's 56 nuclear reactors.In India, EDF operates through five entities - EDF India, EDF International Networks, Citelum India, EDEN Renewables and EDF Renewables India. EDF Renewables, a subsidiary of the EDF Group, has a gross installed capacity of 15.6 GW across 20 countries with 5.9 GW under-construction projects. EDF has been looking to build the 9.9 GW Jaitapur nuclear power project at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra, in partnership with Nuclear Power Corp of India Ltd (NPCIL).Service provider EDF International Networks has installed around 100,000 smart meters in India so far with the aim to eventually reach five million meters.",

        "articleBody": "India is unlikely to further extend exemption provided from a condition for import of solar module import called the approved list of module manufacturers (ALMM), beyond March 31, people aware of the development said. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, in a meeting with solar project developers and module manufacturers Tuesday, took a stock of the capacity additions and commissioning timelines, one of the persons said, adding that overall view was that a further relaxation is not required as adequate time had been given to the industry. A final call on the issue would be taken shortly after taking into account all considerations, another person said, adding that some concession for commissioning could be given for modules that have reached the site before March end.The government had exempted solar projects commissioned by March 31, 2024, from the mandatory requirement of procuring solar modules from the Approved Models and Manufacturers of Solar Photovoltaic Modules (Requirements for Compulsory Registration) Order, 2019. The ALMM mandate was introduced in 2021 requiring solar project developers to buy modules from an approved list as a non-tariff barrier to boost domestic manufacturing.However, with the gap between domestic supply and demand of solar modules, the government had put the mandate in abeyance for FY24. After representations from project developers, the government issued a notice on February 9 for the reimposition of ALMM mandate along with relaxation to the projects that were in advanced stage of construction and the order for the modules had been placed and line of credit had been opened before March 31. The same was, however, put on hold around a week after by the government. Whatever import has come to a solar project site by March 31 can be given time to complete and commission for another six months, one of the industry officials said. However, another person said a call on modification to extend the relaxation for projects in the advanced stage of construction whose module orders were placed, or line of credit was opened before March 31, is under discussion.",

Speaking at the opening of 'Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery' at the Science Museum in London, Gautam Adani said his group's renewable energy arm, Adani Green Energy, is leading an energy transition that honours the commitment of taking care of the planet not just for this generation and the next but also for generations to come.   As the world's leading solar power developer and India's largest renewable energy company, we are taking very big steps,  he said.   In Khavda, which is in the state of Gujarat, we are building the world's largest renewable energy park. It will have a generation capacity of 30 GW of energy - and it is incredibly big. Its area of 538 square kilometers is more than five times bigger than Paris.   This is part of the aim to reach 45 GW of renewable energy by 2030, said Adani, the chairman of the apples-to-airport conglomerate.   This will be like providing clean energy to almost every house in England,  he said.  It currently has an operating renewable portfolio of over 9.5 GW and locked-in projects of up to 21.8 Gigawatt (GW).  The Gallery explores how the world can generate and use energy more sustainably to urgently decarbonise and to limit dangerous climate change.   Through striking displays of contemporary and historic objects from the UK and abroad, interactive digital exhibits, and specially commissioned models, the gallery shows how the past, present and future are shaped by human imagination and innovation and explores how we all have a role to play in deciding our energy future,  a company statement said.  The Gallery, which is open to the public for free, examines this century's defining challenge through the lens of imagination across three sections.  In Future Planet, visitors can explore how scientists use complex computer-based models to understand our planet, and what these tell us about the range of climate futures that might lie ahead.  In Future Energy, technologies and the people behind them that are reimagining how energy is supplied and used are highlighted alongside historic artefacts which provide a longer view of the transition away from fossil fuels.  Adani said museums are very important because they teach and inspire.  This new gallery is about more than just clean air - or about moving away from oil and gas. It is about the energy transition we need - this world needs - and it is about the revolution that is taking place in the world of energy.   The gallery, he said, was special because it makes us think, dream and wish for change.  At the centre of the gallery is Only Breath, a moving sculpture that signifies the power of nature to inspire technological change.  Radiating outward from the centre are plinths which display vital low-carbon renewable energy technologies for the transition, from nuclear, hydrogen and solar to wind and tidal power, alongside remarkable historic innovations that remind us how major change is possible and that many of the technologies needed to make the low-carbon energy transition already exist.  Objects in this section include a 7m long tidal turbine blade made by Scottish renewable energy company Orbital Marine Power and the first electric taxi, the Bersey cab, hailed by Londoners in 1897.  The challenges of electrification, energy storage, and supply and demand are also explored, with visitors invited to play interactive games and use models that show how energy can be generated and distributed. Possible routes to low-carbon transport are featured, as well the decarbonisation of our buildings and construction industries, and visitors can learn about climate modelling and see instruments used to measure climate.  Energy Revolution was designed by award-winning architects, Unknown Works.  A key element of sustainable design was the reuse of redundant shelves from the Science Museum's former object store. The gallery's carbon footprint has been monitored, and recyclable aluminium was used where possible.  The gallery's Title Funder is Adani Green Energy.  Sagar Adani, Executive Director, AGEL, said,  The Science Museum has put together the world's best curated gallery on energy transition. As one of the world's largest renewable energy companies, we are committed to making progress towards net zero - and there is no greater resource in the fight against climate change than education.   Through the sponsorship of the gallery, we aim to inspire young minds, scientists and innovators to imagine a future powered by clean energy and build a carbon-free world. It is an initiative to stimulate their interest, curiosity and awareness, and encourage their active participation in creating clean technologies. The gallery brings together the global community to enable the shift towards energy efficiency, clean energy adoption and carbon emissions reduction.   Sir Ian Blatchford, Director and Chief Executive of the Science Museum Group, said,  In a week when we're celebrating a record 2.25 million visits by UK residents to the museum, including a million children, this stunning gallery offers even more to ignite curiosity among those who will visit in the year ahead - provoking important conversations about the urgent need for the world to generate and use energy more sustainably.

        "articleBody": "Germany - The wind gusting across north German farm country brings much to the village of Sprakebuell: fog and rain from the sea, the occasional migrating stork, the faint smell of manure in the newly fertilized fields. And perhaps best of all, money - from selling the electricity generated by the wind turbines studding the flat green fields stretching out to the North Sea. A slice of the cash goes to the villagers themselves, with the local buy-in making this windy farming enclave near the border with Denmark a showcase for ways to push ahead with renewable energy projects.  It's not easy when headwinds from the post-pandemic global economy - including high interest rates and inflation - are holding back often costly investment in wind, solar and other forms of clean power.  That is slowing the growth in renewables needed to fend off climate change, just as it needs to speed up to meet an ambitious goal reached at the U.N. climate summit to boost clean energy capacity. But Sprakebuell, a three-street cluster of neat one-story houses where tractor traffic outnumbers cars, has seen new life and added prosperity thanks to renewable energy. Small as it is, some of the German town's practices offer lessons that could resonate globally. The dividends from citizen-owned wind parks don't make the recipients rich. Instead, the money is a little extra jingle, a financial buffer  that's very important for us because it gives us a certain freedom,  said Astrid Nissen, 44, who with her husband manages a 150-cow dairy farm on the village's outskirts.  Milk prices fluctuate wildly, but the steadier income from the wind parks is  something we can rely on, something we can use to plan,  she said, occasional moos coming from the barn behind her. The whoosh, whoosh, whoosh from the turbines - inaudible in the village center but noisy up close - contribute some 400,000 euros (over $432,000) a year in taxes. That paid for a new playground, a bike path and even free piano lessons for Sprakebuell's children. When it comes to new projects, global hurdles include higher borrowing costs that make it more costly to fund projects, high prices and clogged supply chains for wind turbines and blades, and  not in my backyard  resistance to wind farms. Interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and others have economists at University College London warning of  green collateral damage  and calling high borrowing costs meant to fight inflation  terrible news for the green transition.   Consultancy Wood Mackenzie found that  clean energy has witnessed one of the toughest years in its short history  with government calls for more generating capacity going unfilled in Germany, Spain, the U.K. and Italy.  The situation is even more serious for lower-income countries in places like Africa, where borrowing costs for the higher up-front investment needed for renewables were already high and have risen even further.  In Sprakebuell, the number of family farms shrank from 26 in 1960 to three larger ones today, and it was on the verge of being merged with a neighboring village 30 years ago. These days, it's home not just to farmers, but people who work a half-hour away in the city of Flensburg. Sprakebuell's residents put in the 20% down payment on building a wind park and local banks lent the remaining 80%. The first wind park had 24 participants; the latest one had more than 150 as word spread. Nissen and her husband started with an investment of the equivalent of just over 5,000 euros ($5,560) more than 20 years ago. The dividends helped pay for a new calf stall, a front-end loader to shovel out animal feed and two workers.  That means we sometimes have a free weekend, sometimes a vacation - and without employees, that's impossible,  she said. Not everyone takes part, but all residents see benefits. There's a shared electric car in the middle of town that anyone can book by smartphone app for 2.50 euros an hour. A small grocery store has opened with an attached cafe, and a restaurant serves lunch daily - signs of new purchasing power. Some similar-sized villages in the region have neither.   Renewable energy projects are visible in the landscape, and for me, it's very important that local people can identify with these projects,  said Christian Andresen, whose company, Solar-Energie Andresen GmbH, developed the wind farms and solar installations. Andresen's projects illustrate factors that can move renewables forward. One is the German government's guaranteed price for electricity over 20 years, which gives banks confidence they can lend and get paid back.  Another is low interest rate loans from the government development bank, the KfW. But even those rates have risen, from 1% a few years ago to over 5%, Andresen said. High interest rates hold back renewables far more than fossil fuel projects. Most of the cost for renewables is up-front in the price of buying the wind turbines or solar panels, while costs to operate them going forward are negligible - the wind blows and sun shines for free.  That makes the cost of borrowing a much more important factor in whether the project will be profitable.  It's the other way around with fossil fuels: a natural gas-fired electricity plant is relatively cheaper to build, while the real costs come later in buying the gas. On top of that is inflation, which has raised the cost of building facilities, and equipment shortages due to jammed supply chains. Those were some reasons Danish company Orsted cited when it canceled two large wind installations off New Jersey. Swedish utility Vattenfall also halted an offshore project in the U.K.  The S&P Global Clean Energy Index of shares in companies with clean energy-related businesses has fallen 26% over the past year, even as broader market indexes have surged to records. In the U.S. higher rates have been a  speed bump  for some renewables projects, said David Shepheard, North American energy and utilities partner at global consultancy Baringa.  The returns are squeezed in the current rate environment  but are brightening, he said, with the Fed expected to cut rates three times this year. The overall picture is nuanced, with a pullback in renewables by oil majors easing supplier logjams, while domestic content requirements for U.S. subsidies increase supply chain for some projects.  In sub-Saharan Africa, where half the population lacks access to electricity, renewable projects face even steeper challenges with financing. With lots of sunshine, solar is an obvious option, but Africa's 1.2 billion people have one-fifth the solar power of cloudy Germany. Borrowing costs there are far higher than in rich countries, while government subsidies are uncertain because of political upheavals and countries already deep in debt.  In Nigeria, where blackouts are an everyday event for about half of the country's 213 million people, some 14 solar projects have stalled because the finances don't add up. The government has been leery of World Bank credit guarantees that would make the projects bankable, concerned about being required to pay for the power even if the grid can't deliver it.  But without that,  nobody will develop or finance a project with a government subsidy because it can dry off,  said Edu Okeke, managing director of energy company Azura, a stakeholder in the Nova solar project in Nigeria's northern Katsina state. The answer can be to raise the price of electricity - which the German government did last year by 25%. That also helps secure financing. Another is subsidized interest rates or credit guarantees as part of developed countries' efforts to help poorer nations combat climate change. And where locals are the owners instead of big energy companies, objections to wind towers' appearance, shadows or whooshing tend to fade, said Andresen, the wind developer.  When I have a share in it, it's a nice noise and a nice view,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "India's solar waste is expected to jump to 600,000 tonnes by 2030 from the current 100,000 tonnes due to rapid deployment of new solar capacities, a study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water said on Wednesday.The country has seen acceleration in solar energy deployment to nearly 75 GW from 5-6 GW in 2015. With aspirations to reach 500 GW of renewable energy by 2050, the management of solar waste is a priority, the report said.Solar capacity of around 292 GW is likely to be deployed by 2030, making solar photovoltaic waste management crucial, it said.  India must proactively address solar waste, not just as an environmental imperative but as a strategic necessity for ensuring energy security and building a circular economy,  said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer, Council on Energy, Environment and Water.Most of this waste is likely to come from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.The waste from India's current installed solar capacity alone will increase to 340 kilotons by 2030. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change had last year issued E-waste Management Rules, aimed at management of solar photovoltaic cells and modules waste. The rules mandate the producers of solar cells and modules to manage their waste under a specific framework.Calling for proactive measures through policies, the report said it is important to incentivise recyclers and prioritise technologies and startups to effectively manage the growing waste stream. Recommendations include following standard guidelines for installation and safety procedures, ensuring access to authorised repair entities, and avoiding disposal in local dump yards to prevent material and value loss.While the design life of the solar modules is 25 years, some see an early end because of factors like transportation damage, module handling, and project operations.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Arvind Kejriwal government has notified Delhi Solar Policy, 2023, that will help the consumers with monthly use of over 400 units to get zero bills through rooftop solar plants, a statement on Saturday said. Under the policy, the consumers who do not get subsidy for using more than 400 units per month can now install rooftop solar panels and get zero bills.  The power bills of commercial users will be halved if they go for rooftop plants, said the statement of Delhi government.  Currently, domestic consumers receive zero bills up to 200 units monthly consumption while monthly consumption 50 percent subsidy is given for 201-400 units.  The Delhi Solar Policy, 2023, was announced by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on January 29.  The Delhi government will spend Rs 570 crores towards the implementation of the policy, it said. It provides for generation-based incentives' to solar panel installers, allowing for additional earnings of up to Rs 900 per month. Expenses incurred for installing solar panels under the new policy will be recovered within four years, according to the policy.  This policy will not only reduce electricity bills for Delhiites but also help in reducing pollution, Power Minister Atishi said.  She said the Kejriwal government aims to have 50 per cent of Delhi's total electricity usage from solar energy by 2027.  The Delhi government will deposit Rs 3 per unit of electricity generated into the bank account of the consumer. For 3 to 10 kilowatts, money will be deposited at the rate of Rs 2 per unit. The government will continue to provide this generation-based incentive for five years.  The amount under GBI will be adjusted against the monthly electricity bill of the consumer. Any excess amount will be deposited into the consumer's bank account by the discom concerned every month. Earlier, GBI amount was transferred only twice a year.  A solar portal is being created to make all the information about the Delhi Solar Policy available in one place. All the relevant information related to the policy will be provided.  The policy also stipulates installation of rooftop solar plants on all government buildings with rooftop surface area of 500 square meters.  For the first time, the Delhi government will provide a capital subsidy to residential consumers of Rs 2,000 per kW of installation up to a maximum of Rs 10,000 per consumer. This will be over and above the capital subsidy of the Central government.  Under 'Net Metering', the solar power generated gets offset with the electricity consumed from the grid. So, if a household consumed 400 units and generated 100 units of solar power, it will be billed only for 300 units. This allows the consumers to benefit from reduced electricity bills, the statement said.  After net metering, which happens every month, the excess solar units left will be rolled-over into subsequent billing cycles for up to 12 months (until close of every financial year), it said.  Additional income: at the end of the year, in case the solar power generated is more than the consumer's annual electricity demand, the consumer will earn money for the same from the discoms, it said.  Currently, around 70 per cent of Delhi's residential consumers get ZERO electricity bill - less than 200 units consumption per month. By installing a rooftop plant under the new policy, partially-subsidized and unsubsidized consumers too can get zero bill every month from the first month itself, it added.",

Out of every state, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have seen over 5 lakh regulations. Outstanding news! In about a month since it was launched, over 1 crore households have already registered themselves for the PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana. Registrations have been pouring in from all parts of the nation,  PM Modi posted on X. Those who haven't registered should also do so at the earliest,  he added.The rooftop solar programme announced in the interim Budget tabled on February 1, would be known as PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana. The rooftop solar project, with an investment of over Rs 75,000 crores, aims to light up 1 crore households by providing up to 300 units of free electricity every month.What is the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana?The scheme was launched by the current government with an aim of providing free electricity to households who opt to install rooftop solar electricity units. Under the said scheme, the households will be able to get 300 units of electricity for free every month.The scheme focuses on the household segment with up to 3 kW system, which covers most of the residential consumers in India.What is the amount of subsidy for households?The subsidy program offers a 60% subsidy on systems up to 2 kW capacity and a 40% subsidy on systems between 2-3 kW. The subsidy is limited to systems up to 3 kW capacity, meaning no financial assistance will be given for capacities exceeding 3 kW.Based on current benchmark prices, eligible beneficiaries will receive a subsidy of Rs 30,000 for 1 kW systems, Rs 60,000 for 2 kW systems, and Rs 78,000 for 3 kW systems or higher.How can you get the system installed?Register on the national rooftop solar portalChoose a vendor from the list provided on the portal A valid electricity connection is required for it and the household must not have availed any other subsidy for solar panelsWhat happens if the cost of system installation goes beyond subsidy?Households have the option to access collateral-free, low-interest loans until the subsidy is credited. If a consumer cannot cover the entire upfront cost required for installation, they can pay 10% upfront and secure a loan for the remaining 90% at a 7% interest rate. Once the central subsidy is disbursed upon system commissioning, it offsets the loan amount, with the remaining 30% repaid over a 10-year period through monthly installments.Various banks offer loans at approximately 7%, calculated at 0.5% above the prevailing repo rate. For systems up to 3 kW, the interest rate remains stable. For example, if the repo rate decreases from the current 6.5% to 5.5%, the effective interest rate for consumers decreases to 6%.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Under the Delhi government's solar policy 50 megawatt (MW) grid-connected rooftop systems will be installed on 645 buildings of different departments and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Delhi Power Minister Atishi, who has approved the solar plant installation initiative, said the move is aligned with the recently approved solar policy of the government. The policy stipulates installation of rooftop solar plants on all government and MCD buildings having a built-up area larger than 500 square metre. Under the plan, around 645 Delhi government and MCD buildings, including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, bus depots and power substations, will be equipped with rooftop solar plants, according to a Delhi government statement.  The Delhi solar policy, passed by the Cabinet on January 29, is being hailed as one of the best and most progressive policies in India. This policy is the key to expand the use of solar power in Delhi's green energy contribution and total power capacity,  Atishi said. The initiative will help make the government buildings more energy-efficient, resulting in these becoming sustainable and completing their energy needs through self generation of power.  Despite the surge in electricity consumption in Delhi, our target is to generate 25 per cent of the city's electricity through solar power plants by 2027,  said the power minister. Launching the solar policy in January, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said domestic consumers who are not covered by subsidy will also be able to get zero amount power bills on installation of rooftop plants. The Delhi government provides free power supply to people having a monthly consumption of up to 200 units and those having 201-400 units monthly consumption get 50 per cent subsidy.",

        "articleBody": "India has attracted a total of $3.8 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the solar energy sector over the past three financial years and the current financial year until September 2023, according to Bhagwant Khuba, Minister of State for Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, and Chemicals and Fertilisers. Khuba highlighted that both domestic and foreign investors were contributing to the installation of solar power plants in the country. This increase in FDI is a testament to the confidence investors have in India's solar energy sector.The Minister shared this information in a video message during the third edition of ETEnergyWorld's Solar Power Congress 2024, held on March 6, 2024. He further mentioned that setting up renewable energy projects, including solar energy projects, can benefit from up to 100% FDI through the automatic route. This move aims to encourage the growth and development of the renewable energy sector in India.Khuba emphasized that these are exciting times for the renewable energy industry in the country, as it is on the brink of a major revolution. The Indian government has implemented various measures to promote solar energy, such as waiving ISTS charges for renewable energy projects commissioned by June 30, 2025. Additionally, a trajectory for renewable purchase obligation up to 2030 has been declared, and ultra-mega renewable energy parks have been established to provide land and transmission to renewable energy developers.The Minister also highlighted the launch of several groundbreaking schemes, including PM-KUSUM, solar rooftops phase-II, 12,000-MW CPSU scheme phase-II, and a production-linked incentive scheme for higher efficiency solar PV models. These initiatives have contributed to a significant increase in India's installed solar power generation capacity, which has risen from 2.8 GW in 2014 to over 73 GW at present.Khuba further mentioned that in the past two financial years, India has consistently added over 12 GW of solar power generation capacity. This momentum of growth is expected to continue in the current year as well. He noted that under the production-linked incentive scheme for high-efficiency solar PV models, letters of award have already been issued for the establishment of 48 GW of fully or partially-integrated solar PV module manufacturing capacity in India. These capacities are scheduled to be commissioned between October 2024 and April 2026, with four companies already beginning partial production under this scheme.",

        "articleBody": "BEIJING: China unleashed the full might of its solar energy industry last year. It installed more solar panels than the United States has in its history. It cut the wholesale price of panels it sells by nearly half. And its exports of fully assembled solar panels climbed 38% while its exports of key components almost doubled.Get ready for an even bigger display of China's solar energy dominance.While the United States and Europe are trying to revive renewable energy production and help companies fend off bankruptcy, China is racing far ahead.At the annual session of China's legislature this week, Premier Li Qiang, the country's second-highest official after Xi Jinping, announced that the country would accelerate the construction of solar panel farms as well as wind and hydroelectric projects.With China's economy stumbling, the ramped-up spending on renewable energy, mainly solar, is a cornerstone of a big bet on emerging technologies. China's leaders say that a  new trio  of industries -- solar panels, electric cars and lithium batteries -- has replaced an  old trio  of clothing, furniture and appliances.The goal is to help offset a steep slump in China's housing construction sector. China hopes to harness emerging industries like solar power, which Xi likes to describe as  new productive forces,  to reenergize an economy that has slowed for more than a decade.The emphasis on solar power is the latest installment in a two-decade program to make China less dependent on energy imports.China's solar exports have already drawn urgent responses. In the United States, the Biden administration has introduced subsidies that cover much of the cost of making solar panels and part of the much higher cost of installing them. The alarm in Europe is particularly great. Officials are bitter that a dozen years ago, China subsidised its factories to make solar panels while European governments offered subsidies to buy panels made anywhere. That led to an explosion of consumer purchases from China that hurt Europe's solar industry.A wave of bankruptcies swept the European industry, leaving the continent largely dependent on Chinese products. We have not forgotten how China's unfair trade practices affected our solar industry -- many young businesses were pushed out by heavily subsidised Chinese competitors,  Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in her State of the Union address last September. 108317321The remnants of Europe's solar industry are now fading away. Norwegian Crystals, an important European producer of raw materials for solar panels, filed for bankruptcy last summer. Meyer Burger, a Swiss company, announced Feb. 23 that it would halt production in the first half of March at its factory in Freiberg, Germany, and would try to raise money to complete factories in Colorado and Arizona.The company's U.S. projects could tap renewable energy manufacturing subsidies provided by President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.China's cost advantage is formidable. A research unit of the European Commission calculated in a report in January that Chinese companies could make solar panels for 16 to 18.9 cents per watt of generating capacity. By contrast, it cost European companies 24.3 to 30 cents per watt, and U.S. companies about 28 cents.The difference partly reflects lower wages in China. Chinese cities have also provided land for solar panel factories at a fraction of market prices. State-owned banks have lent heavily at low interest rates even though solar companies have lost money and some went bankrupt. And Chinese companies have figured out how to build and equip factories inexpensively.Low electricity prices in China make a big difference.Manufacturing the main raw material for solar panels, polysilicon, requires huge amounts of energy. Solar panels typically must generate electricity for at least seven months to recoup the electricity that was needed to make them.Coal provides two-thirds of China's electricity at low cost. But Chinese companies are reducing costs further by installing solar farms in the deserts of western China, where public land is essentially free. Companies then use the electricity from those farms to make more polysilicon.By contrast, Europe has costly electricity, particularly after it stopped buying natural gas from Russia during the Ukraine war. Land used in Europe for solar farms is expensive. In the Southwestern United States, environmental concerns have slowed the installation of solar farms, while zoning issues have blocked permits for the transmission of renewable energy.China's coal consumption has made it the world's largest annual contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. But the country's pioneering role in making solar panels less expensive has slowed the increase in emissions. If the Chinese manufacturers had not brought down the cost of panels by more than 95%, we could not see so many installations across the world,  said Kevin Tu, a Beijing energy expert and nonresident fellow with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Annual solar panel installations have nearly quadrupled worldwide since 2018.Some of the new solar farms generating electricity for polysilicon production are in two provinces in southwestern China, Qinghai and Yunnan. But much of the polysilicon is made in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China. The United States bans imports made with materials or components manufactured by forced labor in Xinjiang, where China has repressed predominantly Muslim minorities like the Uyghurs.That has led the United States to block some shipments of solar panels from China, while the European Union has been considering similar action.Chinese companies increasingly do the initial, high-value stages of solar panel manufacturing in China, and then ship the components to overseas factories for final assembly. This allows the shipments to avoid trade barriers, like tariffs imposed on many Chinese imports by President Donald Trump. Several of China's biggest solar panel manufacturers are building final assembly plants in the United States to tap subsidies offered as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.The law includes extensive subsidies to revive the U.S. solar panel industry, which almost completely collapsed a decade ago in the face of low-cost imports from China. But building an industry that can stand on its own will be difficult.China produces practically all of the world's equipment for making solar panels, and almost all of the supply of every component of solar panels, from wafers to special glass. There is know-how to it, and it's all in China,  said Ocean Yuan, the CEO of Grape Solar, a company in Eugene, Oregon, that works with Chinese solar companies that are setting up assembly operations in the United States.That know-how used to be in the United States. As recently as 2010, Chinese producers of solar panels relied mainly on imported equipment, and faced long and costly delays if anything broke down. It took days or weeks to get replacement parts and engineers,  said Frank Haugwitz, a longtime solar energy consultant specialising in the Chinese industry.In 2010, Applied Materials, a Silicon Valley company, built two extensive labs in Xi'an, the city in western China famous for terra-cotta warriors. Each lab was the size of two football fields. They were intended to do final testing for assembly lines with robots that could churn out solar panels with practically no human labor.But within several years, Chinese companies had figured out how to do it themselves. Applied Materials considerably cut back its production of solar panel tooling and focused on making similar equipment that makes semiconductors.Today anyone who tries to make solar panels outside China faces potential delays in installing or fixing equipment.While Europe is mulling whether to follow the United States' example with its own subsidies and import restrictions on solar products, Haugwitz said,  It will remain a challenge for Europeans to compete.

        "articleBody": "Torrent Power on Thursday said it has bagged a contract from Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co Ltd for setting up 306 MW solar projects worth Rs 1,540 crore under the PM-KUSUM Scheme. The company in a statement said that the Letter of Award (LOA) for the project was handed over by Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.   Torrent Power has emerged as a successful bidder and has received Letter of Award from Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (MSEDCL) on March 7, 2024, for setting up of 306 MW grid-connected solar power project, at 48 distributed locations, across Nasik District, Maharashtra,  the statement said.  The project is conceived by MSEB Solar Agro Power Ltd (MSAPL) under Mukhya Mantri Saur Krushi Vahini Yojana 2.0 (MSKVY 2.0) scheme for implementation of feeder level solarisation under Component C of the PM-KUSUM scheme connected to the distribution network.  The project will be commissioned within 18 months at an estimated cost of Rs 1,540 crore.  The tariff for the project is Rs 3.10/kWh for the period of 25 years.  With the award of the 306 MW capacity, Torrent's renewable capacity under construction has increased to 1.7 GW. On completion of this project, the company's total renewable capacity will increase to 3 GW in the next 18-24 months.  The company stated that the Maharashtra government seeks to ensure stable daytime electricity to agriculture consumers through decentralised solar power projects.  To enable the development of the MSKVY 2.0 scheme, the Maharashtra government has taken a cluster wise approach whereby revenue land and certain approvals are already obtained by MSAPL directly into the Project SPVs.  Torrent will acquire 100 per cent of the equity shares of the Project SPV and will get the Central Finance Assistance (CFA) from the Central government for eligible capacity as per the terms of the PM KUSUM Scheme.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Avaada Energy has secured decentralised agricultural solar projects totalling around 1,140 megawatts to be set up at an investment of Rs 5,000 crore. The company has received the Letter of Award (LoA) for the project from MSEB Solar Agro Power Limited (MSAPL), a state-owned enterprise of the Maharashtra government, Avaada Group said in a statement. The LoA is for setting up 1,138 MW decentralised agricultural solar PV projects in Maharashtra. It will involve a greenfield investment of Rs 5,000 crore and span across 192 locations in 10 districts of the state, the group said. This project aligns with the Mukhyamantri Saur Krushi Vahini Yojana 2.0 (MSKVY 2.0), also known as 'Mission 2025', aimed at transforming the agricultural energy supply with a 30 per cent feeder solarisation target by 2025. Maharashtra is home to approximately 29 million consumers, of which 4.5 million are agriculture consumers, accounting for 22 per cent of the electricity consumption, Avaada said, adding that the demand for a reliable and consistent daytime power supply has been a longstanding issue. The introduction of decentralised agriculture solar PV projects is a strategic response to this demand, and it will ensure that farmers receive uninterrupted power during the day. The project will generate around 2,500 direct and indirect jobs.  This initiative is designed to provide our farmers with a reliable source of electricity for irrigation, while also creating new opportunities for employment and enhancing income prospects. Such efforts are instrumental in driving forward the development of the state,  Vineet Mittal, Chairperson of Avaada Group, said.",

        "articleBody": "Solar power is expected to dominate global electricity markets in the next few decades, and already accounts for three-quarters of renewable energy capacity, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, BloombergNEF predicts solar builds will climb another 25%, adding more than 500 gigawatts of capacity.All of that solar needs a lot of space. Powering just one megawatt of capacity requires at least five acres, meaning a 200-megawatt project (roughly 3,000 panels) takes up as much space as 550 American football fields. That calculus is one reason China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest solar market \u2014 is hosting many projects in remote desert regions. It\u2019s also why the IEA expects rooftop and residential solar to expand faster than farms this year.\u201cIt\u2019s great to have [solar installations] in our communities,\u201d says Bonnie Heiple, commissioner at the Massachusetts Department of Energy. \u201cActually seeing where your power comes from gives people more of an impetus to make the types of changes in their daily lives we\u2019re asking them to make.\u201dAs solar gains momentum, its champions are getting more creative about where to place panels. There are solar arrays on top of big-box stores, solar arrays on yachts and solar farms that float. There are panels small enough to work on a balcony and even small enough to attach to a smartphone. To minimize clearing land, engineers are also working on incorporating the technology into existing infrastructure. From landfills to art installations, here are five unexpected places you can find a solar farm \u2014 or at least some strategically placed panels.CarportsParking lots and garages require plenty of space. Adding a solar canopy can provide shade, safety and seamless charging for EVs, says Ben Jones, vice president of design and engineering at New York-based DSD Renewables. DSD is behind a project to add solar canopies to 16 parking lots and garages at Rutgers University in New Jersey and has installed almost 200 megawatts of canopy projects across the US since it was founded in 2019.It\u2019s also the architect of a 6.5-megawatt canopy project at Caesars Entertainment Casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The project supplies about 6% of the energy used by the casino, while also providing shade for the top deck of the parking garage.Jones says canopy projects both use land efficiently and \u201cbroaden the mind about where you can put solar.\u201d For parking in particular, \u201cmost people avoid the top layer of a multi-story parking garage because it\u2019s a long way up and you\u2019re going to be subject to the elements, so you might as well put that dead space to good use,\u201d he says. These types of projects can also meaningfully contribute to a company or municipality\u2019s renewable energy goals. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a statement that blends in nicely, but also lowers their operating expenses,\u201d Jones says.(Retired) golf coursesShuttered golf courses can be ideal locations for solar farms. There\u2019s less work required to clear the land, and the terrain tends to be relatively flat. There\u2019s also some poetic justice to installing renewable energy at places that used to eat up water resources and compromise local biodiversity.In Calverton, Long Island, the Calverton Links Golf Course is home to a nearly 23-megawatt solar project that opened in 2022, nine years after the course closed for business. The project is owned by National Grid Ventures, the venture capital arm of National Grid, which operates power grids in the UK and US. Will Hazelip, president of National Grid Ventures Northeast, says the keys to finding a golf course that\u2019s ideal for solar are a reasonable price tag and proximity to grid infrastructure. \u201cYou're close to the demand and it\u2019s a large amount of space,\u201d he says. \u201cThe challenge is finding that exact combination.\u201dFloating solar farmsTo dodge land constraints entirely, many countries are experimenting with solar farms that float. While the costs can be high \u2014 40% more than land farms, according to BloombergNEF \u2014 big flat surfaces with constant access to sunlight are compelling.Hundreds of floating projects have been erected on lakes and reservoirs around the world. Japan has dozens of smaller floating arrays, India has added major operations, and facilities have been built in countries that include Colombia, Israel and Ghana. Last year, the largest floating solar project in the US went online in New Jersey, where it generates enough energy to power 1,400 homes.In China, a massive floating solar farm in Huainan in the eastern Anhui province boasts more than 500,000 panels \u2014 enough to generate power for over 100,000 homes. The flotilla of panels is the size of 400 soccer pitches and stretches across an artificial lake that sits on top of a former coal mine (more poetic justice).Floating farms don\u2019t necessarily generate more electricity than those on land, but a study published in Nature Sustainability found that more than 6,000 local power systems around the world could be entirely self-sufficient with floating farms.Landfills and decommissioned fossil fuel sitesAs climate change drives a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, there are a growing number of opportunities to realize that shift directly: Decommissioned fossil fuel sites, which already have access to local power grids, are excellent candidates for solar farms, says Thomas Byrne, chief executive officer of New York-based renewables company CleanCapital.\u201cWhat a wonderful story it is to be able to say, \u2018Everyone disregarded this piece of land, but now we\u2019re utilizing it again to power the future,\u2019\u201d Byrne says. CleanCapital owns and operates 300 megawatts of solar capacity, including a solar farm on a former steel plant in Buffalo, New York.In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022 includes incentives for companies to build solar projects on brownfields \u2014 landfills and decommissioned industrial plants whose opportunities for reuse are otherwise severely limited. Last year, the US Environmental Protection Agency introduced a program to promote and assist these kinds of transformations.\u201cIt\u2019s dead space and can\u2019t be built on otherwise, you might as well build a solar farm,\u201d says Jones at DSD, which opened a 4.3-megawatt solar farm on a landfill last year in Bethel, New York. More than half of the power generated supplies local residents and businesses.Massachusetts, which offers its own tax incentives for developers to install solar on brownfields, currently leads the US in such installations; the state has 92 solar farms on closed landfills, totaling 256 megawatts of capacity. In 2022, the solar landfills offset more than 62,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Massachusetts Department of Energy.Solar artArtist Elizabeth Monoian and architect Robert Ferry are the husband-and-wife duo behind Land Art Generator, an organization that holds competitions for solar art designers and connects the winners to communities that provide public art grants. Started in 2008, Land Art Generator now has more than 1,500 artist ideas it shops to communities around the world.In San Antonio, Land Art Generator worked with JT Brackenridge Elementary School to create a solar-panel mural that celebrates the community\u2019s history. The art printed on the panels \u2014 a photo of the class of 1906 and the fifth-grade class of 2020 \u2014 only shaves off 4% of the energy it would have generated otherwise. Next year, Land Art Generator plans to unveil the 100-foot-tall \u201cArch of Time\u201d in a Houston park. Designed by Berlin-based artist and architect Riccardo Mariano, the project is made from black solar panels and will provide shade while generating enough energy to power 40 nearby homes. The installation also acts as a clock, projecting the sun\u2019s rays in alternating colors.\u201cWe\u2019re at a point where solar is the least expensive way to make energy \u2026 no matter how you slice it, no matter where you are,\u201d Ferry says. \u201cThere has become a breathing space for the industry to explore new ways of designing these infrastructures.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Over half a dozen renewable energy companies that were planning to set up solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing capacities under the government's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme (Tranche-II), are seeking a deadline extension for the same, said three industry executives aware of the development.The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), the nodal agency for the scheme, had invited online bids under three baskets - Polysilicon-ingots-wafers-cells-modules (PWCM), ingots-wafers-cells-module (WCM), and cells-modules (CM). The companies met MNRE and requested a deadline extension as the deadline was very stringent. Also, since this is a new industry for many players, we need time to bring the technology to India and develop the skill set,  said a senior industry executive part of the discussion process with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE).An email to MNRE remained unanswered.Another official added that the companies had sought a timeline extension of at least one year.  MNRE has asked the companies to submit a request. We have done that. We have also requested that the bank guarantees not be encashed and any penalties not be levied,  he said.In the WCM basket, PLI was allocated to Waaree Energies Ltd (Rs 1,923.24 crore), Avaada Ventures Private Limited (Rs 961.62 crore), ReNew Solar (Shakti Four) Private Limited (Rs 1,538.592 crore), JSW Renewable Technologies Limited (Rs 320.54 crore), and Grew Energy Private Ltd (Rs 566.71 crore).These companies will set up a total capacity of 16,800 MW, half of which is eligible for PLI.The companies did not respond to an email seeking comment.Last month ET reported that a record fall in prices of solar panels has made Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Energy put its solar module manufacturing plans on hold.JSW Renewable Technologies Limited, a wholly owned step-down subsidiary of JSW Energy Limited had been allocated Rs 320 crore for 1 GW of WCM. The facility was to be operational by 2025.JSW Energy executives had told analysts that with panel prices dipping close to single digit, around $0.10 to $0.11, the company had put the project on hold, re-evaluating its business viability.The company planned to backward integrate and de-risk its supply chain to aid its growth plans. The strategic intent was to use this capacity for captive consumption in building RE projects by JSW Neo Energy Limited.China commands 80% of global manufacturing capacity and has seen the cost of solar module production drop by 42% in the last 12 months to $0.15 per watt. Given the dominance of Chinese original equipment manufacturers across the solar PV manufacturing value chain, analysts expect the pricing to remain subdued.",

SJVN Chairman and Managing Director Geeta Kapur informed that the project is expected to generate about 504 million units in the first year of commissioning and the cumulative energy generation over 25 years would be about 11,732 million units. As per Request for Selection (RfS), the project will be commissioned in 18 months from the date of signing of the power purchase agreement, which would be signed between GUVNL and SGEL for 25 years. The commissioning of this project is expected to reduce 5,74,868 tonnes of carbon emissions. SJVN, a leading Power CPSE, is on rapid progression to achieve its shared vision of 25,000 MW by 2030 and 50,000 MW by 2040.

        "articleBody": "Rooftop solar capacity addition saw a 6.25 per cent growth to 1.7 gigawatt in 2023, supported by various factors like reduced installation cost, according to Mercom Capital. The rooftop capacity addition was at 1.6 gigawatt (GW) in 2022, the US-based research firm said in its latest report. In October-December 2023, 406 megawatts (MW) of rooftop solar was added, down 15.9 per cent from 483 MW in the last quarter of 2022, the 'Mercom India Rooftop Solar Market Report' said. Cumulative rooftop solar installations reached 10.5 GW at the end of December 2023. Residential installations were the primary driver of capacity additions in 2023. However, growth was marginal as many commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers waited for module prices to stabilise to lower their capital investments. The residential segment accounted for over half of the capacity additions in 2023, followed by C&I segments.  Rapidly falling system costs, increasing electricity rates, incentives for residential installations, and attractive return on investments for the C&I segment are all fuelling demand, which is expected to accelerate in 2024. The wait for prices to continually drop is over, and the resurgence in construction activity has begun,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. Rooftop solar tenders totalling 1.2 GW were issued in 2023, down 45.7 per cent year-on-year. Uttar Pradesh New Energy Development Agency drove tender activity in 2023, accounting for 44.2 per cent of announced tender capacity, the report said. Tenders to add rooftop solar systems on government buildings across India accounted for nearly 57 per cent of the announced total solar tender capacity. Gujarat was the leader in installation, accounting for 27.3 per cent of cumulative solar rooftop installations, followed by Maharashtra and Rajasthan, with 13.3 per cent and 8.1 per cent share, respectively. The top 10 states accounted for 77.3 per cent of cumulative rooftop solar installations as of December 2023. The average cost of rooftop solar systems fell for the fifth straight quarter.108104996",

        "articleBody": "The government has amended the electricity rules to exempt households from a technical feasibility study for power systems up to 10 kW capacity in a bid to encourage rooftop solar adoption. For systems of capacity higher than 10 kW, the time frame for completing the feasibility study has been reduced to 15 days from 20 days.The amendments to the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020, also further reduced the time allowed for getting new electricity connections and simplified the process of setting up rooftop solar installations, said power and new and renewable energy minister RK Singh. He said the amendments empower consumers living in multi-storeyed flats to choose their connection type and ensure separate billing for common areas and back-up generators in residential societies.The changes also provide for check meters to be installed by distribution companies in case of consumer complaints, to verify electricity consumption, the government said in a statement. The key changes will facilitate easier and quicker installation of rooftop solar systems, it said.Under the new rules, the distribution system strengthening necessary for rooftop solar photovoltaic systems up to 5 kW capacity will be done by the distribution company at its own cost.The time frame for the distribution licensee to commission rooftop solar systems has been halved to 15 days.Consumers can obtain separate electricity connections for charging their electric vehicles, according to the new rules. The time allowed for obtaining a new electricity connection has been reduced to three days from seven days in metropolitan areas, seven days from 15 in other municipal areas and 15 days from 30 in rural areas.Provisions have been introduced in the rules, to enhance consumer choice and promote greater transparency in metering and billing.Owners residing in cooperative group housing societies, multi-storeyed buildings and residential colonies will now have the option to choose either individual connections or a single-point connection for the whole premise. In cases where consumers raise complaints about meter reading not aligning with their actual electricity consumption, the distribution licensee will have to install an additional meter within five days from the date of receipt of the complaint. This additional meter will be used to verify the consumption for a minimum period of three months, thus reassuring consumers and ensuring accuracy in billing.",

        "articleBody": "Sections of solar equipment manufacturers and battery recyclers are teaming up to provide used batteries a second life in solar applications. Recyclers told ET that the Centre\u2019s renewed incentive for rooftop solarisation, as well as the continued focus on Electric Vehicle policies was instrumental in the collaboration. Bengaluru-based Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery recycler, BatX Energies co-founder Vikrant Singh said the depleted batteries came with reduced range which was risky for most EV owners. \u201cIf the battery is about 20% depleted, that is the end of its life as far as an EV is concerned. We then repurpose that battery into stationary applications,\u201d he told ET. While individuals with solar powered homes could use them as well, Singh said his organisation was in talks with solar providers to try and make these batteries fit solar use on a larger scale. A solar panel maker, on the condition of anonymity said that his company was considering selling recycled EV batteries for storage purposes with the panels. \u201cWe expect the Union government\u2019s recent announcement to boost sales in our sector. The rise in the number of EVs would also lead to batteries being easily available, making it a win-win situation,\u201d he told ET. In the Interim Union Budget this year, the government announced a plan to provide one crore homes with up to 300 units free electricity every month via rooftop solarisation. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that by selling the surplus energy to DISCOMs, households would be able to save up to Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000 every year. In 2023, Amitabh Kant, India\u2019s G20 Sherpa, stated in the summit that India plans to achieve 100% electrification of two-and-three-wheelers and 65-70% electrification of buses by 2030. About 46% of lithium-ion batteries available for recycling in India by 2030 will have come from EVs, according to a 2022 Niti Aayog report on \u2018Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery Reuse and Recycling Market in India.\u2019 According to the Battery Waste Management Rules 2022, 90% of the materials discarded must be recycled and recovered by 2026, with 20% of them going into new batteries by 2030. \u201cIt takes around 1600 gallons of water to mine one kg of Lithium for a battery\u2026it makes sense to draw out the maximum use we can out of it,\u201d Singh said.",

Extensions granted to several large-scale projects and delays primarily due to land and transmission issues impacted capacity additions during the year. Large-scale solar accounted for 77.2% of annual solar capacity additions, and rooftop solar contributed 22.8%. In October-December, India added 1.8 GW of solar capacity, a 6.6% decrease compared to the 1.9 GW installed in the corresponding quarter a year ago.Compliance with grid connectivity regulations, projects in line to secure power evacuation in the habitat of Great Indian Bustard and project extensions continued to impact quarterly capacity additions, it said. Compliance with amended grid code provisions added to power evacuation challenges, leading to project delays. As of December 2023, the cumulative installed solar capacity stood at 72 GW. Utility-scale projects accounted for 85.4%, and rooftop solar accounted for 14.6% of cumulative installations, it said. India's large-scale solar project pipeline stood at 105.3 GW with another 70.6 GW of projects tendered and pending auction at the end of 2023. As anticipated, 2023 was an underwhelming year for solar additions in India,  Raj Prabhu, CEO at Mercom Capital Group said.However, the outlook is bright as a significant pipeline of large-scale projects is slated for 2024, setting the stage to make it the best year for solar in India by a considerable margin, Prabhu said. Barring any setbacks on the policy front and supply disruptions, I am optimistic that India is finally on the cusp of becoming a 20+ GW a year market,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "For pronghorn, those antelope-like creatures of the American West, the grassland north of Flagstaff, Arizona, is prime habitat. It gives the animals the food and conditions they need to survive fall and winter. But for a nation racing to adopt renewable energy, the land is prime for something else: solar panels. The sun shines strong, the terrain is flat and high-voltage transmission lines are in place from a decommissioned coal plant. Energy collected here could speed to major metropolitan regions across the West, part of a colossal wave of clean power needed to stave off the worst effects of global warming. Animals need humans to solve climate change. But they also need places to live. Loss of habitat is the top driver of a staggering global decline in biodiversity, the variety of life on Earth. The boom in solar power, set to be the fastest-growing energy source in the United States, is predicted to fence off millions of acres across the nation, blanketing them in rows of glassy squares. The good news for wildlife is that there are ways for solar developers to make installations less harmful and even beneficial for many species, including fences that let some animals pass, wildlife corridors, native plants that nurture pollinators and more. But at this pivotal moment, as solar farms sprout nationwide, those measures often go unused. Among the reasons: a patchwork of local and state regulations governing large-scale solar, not enough research on how animals interact with it and an absence of federal guidelines on siting or design.  We're faced with two truths: We have a climate change crisis, but we also have a biodiversity crisis,  said Meaghan Gade, a program manager at the Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies.  We have to be mindful that there's wildlife that are dependent on these habitats, and we have to be smart and thoughtful about how we're doing this deployment so that we can hold both of those crises at the same time.  Eighty percent of states rely on voluntary approaches to minimize impacts to species and habitat, according to the association. As developers race ahead, the decisions they make today will reverberate for decades. On the grassland north of Flagstaff, a ranching family, solar developers and state wildlife biologists have come together to try solutions on the fly. One sunny day last fall, a helicopter descended over a herd of pronghorn streaking across shrubby grasslands near the site of a planned solar farm. Pronghorn are exceptional for their combination of speed and endurance. If there were a global mammal marathon, a pronghorn would probably win. Even though they look like antelopes, they are more closely related to giraffes. While Arizona's pronghorn population is stable, it's a small fraction of the species' historical numbers. On this day, a net shot from the helicopter, a buck fell and a wrangler jumped out. He tied the buck's feet, and a biologist blindfolded the heaving animal, hoping to calm him. Monitoring his temperature for signs of dangerous distress, they worked quickly to attach a tag to his ear and a GPS collar around his neck. The collar will track how he responds to the solar farm, which will be broken up into sections. Fifteen corridors ranging from a quarter-mile to more than a half-mile will offer habitat and passage for pronghorn, mule deer and elk. A moment later the pronghorn galloped away, an unknowing participant in an experiment in coexistence.  Competing Interests at Play On the surface, the most wildlife-friendly practice may seem obvious.  If you start with a site that has really no conservation value -- it's cleared, it's degraded, whatever -- then everything you do at that point is a win,  said Liz Kalies, an ecologist who studies clean energy for the Nature Conservancy and works in North Carolina, where forests have been felled to make way for solar. Pollinators such as bees, for example, can benefit from solar facilities that replace crops treated with pesticides, especially when the new installations include native species (nearby crops can benefit, too). In Kentucky, a solar farm is going up at the site of a former coal mine. But for developers, it's not so easy. Getting permits and financing for work on former industrial sites can be tricky because of risks including leftover toxic waste. Rural communities sometimes oppose the conversion of agricultural areas to solar, arguing that arable land should be protected for food security and to maintain the economic health of farming towns. And crucially, developers need to be able to move the electricity, which makes the availability of transmission infrastructure paramount to any site.  While it would be nice to think that there's all of these low-conflict areas that developers could just go build on and everybody would leave them alone, in reality that's not how things work,  said Tom Vinson, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the American Clean Power Association, which represents utility-scale solar developers.  There's always competing interests out there.  Potential solar sites are so ecologically varied that federal guidelines on wildlife and habitat wouldn't be appropriate, he said. And solar developers already take precautions for animals and plants that are protected under the Endangered Species Act, the intensive care unit for wildlife.  Fences Make Good Neighbors All kinds of energy development exact a toll on all kinds of plants and animals. Oil and natural gas reduce habitat and can cause pollution, including catastrophic spills. They also drive climate change, which is expected to replace habitat loss as the leading threat to the world's biodiversity in future decades. Wind turbines come with bird and bat collisions, though many of those deaths can be minimized, and the infrastructure doesn't take up much space. Anecdotes abound of elk and pronghorn strolling around turbines or napping in their shade. Solar farms need much more land per unit of energy. While they are projected to take up a tiny fraction of the area dedicated to agriculture, they come on top of that, and on top of land occupied by cities, towns, roads and all kinds of industries.Up to one-third of potential solar development in the United States could overlap with areas that have high value for wildlife movement, according to one study, as animals move to adapt to climate change. (Rooftop and other small-scale solar can go a long way toward taking pressure off big installations, but U.S. energy demand would still require a surge in large-scale projects.) One way to reduce solar's damage is wildlife-friendly fencing. National electricity codes require fencing to protect people from electrical hazards and infrastructure from damage. Simply replacing the conventional chain-link version with fencing that has wider gaps will let creatures such as foxes scamper through. Raising the bottom of a fence off the ground, to offer a few inches of passage, accomplishes the same thing. In Florida, a combination of 4- and 6-foot fencing allows panthers and deer to jump into many of Florida Power and Light's solar facilities, said Jack Eble, a company spokesperson. Wooden supports that shore up fences let medium-size animals crawl over, and larger openings at the bottom give access to small animals.  We have not experienced any issues with wildlife damaging solar panels or other solar-related infrastructure to date,  Eble said. But so far, wildlife-friendly fencing is not commonly used, according to Josh Ennen, a senior scientist at the Renewable Energy Wildlife Institute, a nonprofit collaboration that seeks to find solutions to wildlife conflicts and is mostly funded by industry. Developers are often unfamiliar with the options for wildlife-friendly fencing, and it may not be easily available. Furthermore, many worry it will backfire if federally protected animals use the permeable fencing to wander onto the site. Suddenly, developers would have to worry about fines for driving over, say, a baby desert tortoise. Regulations can get in the way, too. Around the country, solar facilities are subject to a disparate patchwork of local and state rules, some of which require specific kinds of fencing.These challenges need to be solved quickly, biologists and wildlife advocates say.  It's not something we can easily retrofit,  Kalies said.  Developers don't want to tear down a fence once it's up. A Trade-Off for the Future At Babbitt Ranches in Arizona, the solar farm's fencing will be raised off the ground for smaller animals such as rabbits. Pronghorn, mule deer and elk will be kept out because of the developer's concerns that they could damage equipment or hurt themselves. For those animals, they're planning the corridors. Long known for Hereford cattle and quarter horses, Babbitt Ranches stretches over 700,000 acres of private and leased public land. Transmission lines have drawn a crowd of clean-energy developers, and the first wind turbines are up. Clenera, a solar developer, approached the ranch in 2018. For Babbitt President Bill Cordasco, the idea of a large solar project was appealing both financially and morally. It would bring in revenue for the family business while helping reduce climate risks for future generations. But he knew the pronghorn relied on that land. Cordasco wanted to find a solution that would meet everyone's needs, including the pronghorn.  If you guys aren't interested in working through this pronghorn deal, it ain't going to happen,  he recalled telling Clenera during their first in-person meeting. Clenera was interested. State wildlife officials had data from earlier GPS collaring, so they knew how pronghorn and mule deer moved through the area. A renewable energy ordinance passed by Coconino County, where Flagstaff is, gave additional teeth to the importance of maintaining wildlife linkages in solar facilities. A back-and-forth over the site design led to adding migration corridors and closing off some dead-end areas where animals could have gotten trapped or disoriented. Developers and wildlife officials discussed the pros and cons of quarter-mile versus half-mile corridors. (Would the smaller ones be wide enough for the animals to use? Would the larger be worth a significant increase in the overall footprint?) In the end, everyone agreed on the range of different corridors, creating a kind of natural experiment. The miles of additional high-voltage cable and the extra fencing required to break big sections of solar panels into smaller ones make the project more expensive, Clenera officials said, though they declined to say how much. Cordasco also asked them to help fund long-term studies on the impact of the solar farm on wildlife migration.  It's a lot of money,  said Tom Fitzgerald, vice president of development at Clenera.  That's also the cost of getting all of the stakeholders to get behind you and to support your project, and to pay to be a contributing member of any community. Jeff Gagnon, a biologist with the Arizona Game and Fish Department who oversaw the collaring effort, was thrilled to have his agency's advice taken seriously. He focuses on habitat connectivity, and while dozens of solar projects have come to his agency for review, he said, developers often disregard or minimize their recommendations.  They can take it or leave it,  he said. This time, he pointed out, Cordasco made sure things went differently. Cordasco knows the pronghorn he loves could be negatively affected, but he believes the damage will be minimized and the trade-off will be worth it for generations of people and wildlife to come.  When you make these bigger decisions,  Cordasco said,  you have to have a very long-term view. ",

The fundraise, a combination of debt and equity, will be used for completion of its ongoing projects and expansion in green hydrogen and ammonia production, they said.Investment bank Ambit has been hired and feelers were sent to large investors such as Mubadala, GIP (Blackrock), Actis and NIIF, said the people, who did not wish to be identified. 107701069ACME, established in 2003 by Manoj Kumar Upadhyay, is the largest solar independent power producer in India with a diversified portfolio of 5.5 GW spread across 12 states and with a mix of central and state utilities. Its portfolio of operational solar power projects has grown to 2.9 GW from 15 MW in 2011. The rest of the 2.6 GW is under different phases of development. In a similar deal, Avaada Group had raised $1.07 billion (about '8,200 crore) from Canadian fund Brookfield last year by diluting a significant stake to fund its green hydrogen and green ammonia ventures in India.When contacted, an ACME spokesperson declined to comment. Last year, ACME announced plans to expand in the areas of green hydrogen and ammonia production. ACME Green Hydrogen and Chemicals Company, a joint venture between the UK unit of ACME Group and Norway-based Scatec ASA, aims to become a leading green energy provider in the world by 2030 and produce 10 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia and hydrogen. It started working to develop projects in countries including Oman, India, Egypt, Australia and Chile. Last year, it also announced plans to invest about \u20b927,000 crore to set up the country's largest single location green hydrogen and derivatives manufacturing facility in Odisha. It plans to set up a nearly 1.3 MTPA green ammonia production facility at Gopalpur. ACME Group had also tied up a \u20b94,000 crore loan from state-owned REC for its green hydrogen and ammonia project in Oman. The amount will be used to start the first phase of the project, to be established at the Special Economic Zone in Duqm, Oman. The first phase of the project is expected to produce 100,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually.The Indian government has set a target of producing 5 million metric tonnes per annum of green hydrogen by 2030.As part of diversifying into newer areas, ACME has been selling various operational and under-construction projects in the past couple of years.In December 2023, ACME sold solar power assets under its 14 special purpose vehicles to BluPine Energy - a unit of London-based private equity firm Actis - for an enterprise value of \u20b91,700 crore. ACME had shelved \u20b92,200 crore public listing plans in 2018 due to stock market turbulence.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has reimposed the Approved List of Models & Manufacturers (ALMM) for solar modules with effect from 1 April, 2024.The earlier Order, dated 10 March 2023, stated that projects commissioned by 31 March 2024 will be exempted from the requirement of procuring solar modules from ALMM. However, it has been decided that the relaxation in ALMM will apply to all cases where the projects are in the advanced stage of construction and the order for the modules has been placed before 31 March 2024. According to the office memorandum dated 9 February 2024, ALMM will apply to solar rooftops and PM KUSUM, which are subsidised. It will not apply to projects set up under open access or as captive by private parties, which means that ALMM will not be applicable for people who set up their own capacity.It added that the ALMM will apply only to those projects which are sponsored or subsidised by the government. It will apply to the government or its agencies procuring power for its own consumption or for distribution to the people through discoms. The ALMM Order was held in abeyance for FY24. Thus, projects commissioned by 31 March 2024 were exempted from the requirement of procuring solar modules from ALMM. The MNRE issued the Approved Models and Manufacturers of Solar Photovoltaic Modules Order, 2019 on 2 January 2019. It stated that ALMM shall consist of list-I, specifying models and manufacturers of solar PV modules and list-II, specifying models and manufacturers of solar cells. First ALMM list for solar modules was issued on 10 March 2021. The ALMM list for solar PV cells has not yet been issued.According to Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice-president and group head - corporate ratings, ICRA, the reimposition of ALMM from April 1, 2024, is a positive for these OEMs. \u201cThe reimposition requiring solar projects awarded by central nodal agencies and state distribution utilities to source modules from solar module manufacturers listed under this order which currently comprises only domestic solar OEMs, is a positive,\u201d he said.He added that the scale-up in domestic module manufacturing capacity over the past 12 months is expected to improve the availability of modules from domestic OEMs. However, the sector would remain dependent on imports for sourcing solar PV cells and wafers, given the limited cell manufacturing capacity and lack of wafer capacity in India. \u201cIn this context, setting up fully integrated units awarded under the production-linked incentive (PLI) remains important to reduce dependence on imports,\u201d said Kadam.From the independent power producers\u2019 perspective, he said that this provides relief for IPPs with advanced progress in development and with expected commissioning post-March 31, 2024. The order allows exemption from ALMM for open access-based and captive solar projects, enabling these projects to source modules from the most cost-competitive sources. He added that based on the prevailing cost of imported solar PV cells and modules, the sourcing of imported modules is relatively cheaper than the cost of sourcing modules from domestic OEMs after accounting for the import duties.",

        "articleBody": " Well, these losses are primarily because of the other aspects relating to depreciation and also in terms of Ind AS 115. So in terms of operating profit, Mundra has made operating profit in terms of EBITDA, it has made profit,  says Dr Praveer Sinha, CEO & MD, Tata Power. RK Singh over the weekend told us that power is the game in town. I am sure you would concur with that. Yes, I think so. I think the way the demand has been growing up, there is a huge surge and we expect that to meet the demand, lot of capacity addition will happen in the next few years. Okay, capacity addition will have to happen if you have to meet that growing demand. But I wanted to come back to the earnings this quarter and Mundra plant reverted to losses this time despite section 11 at play. What explains that and do you expect these losses to continue in Q4, Q1 as well?Well, these losses are primarily because of the other aspects relating to depreciation and also in terms of Ind AS 115. So in terms of operating profit, Mundra has made operating profit in terms of EBITDA, it has made profit. But because of these aspects about the depreciation and also because of the Ind AS requirement, you have seen the losses, which is a nominal loss. Okay, fair enough. Let us also talk about coal prices, which have fallen 81% understandably. But what is the outlook on coal prices? If you can share any insights, any update on plans to monetise the coal mine portfolio?Our coal mines have been doing very well, they continue to perform at a very high capacity. Of course, the prices have now stabilised, it has come to a level of around $120 for 6500 kcal coal. And we expect that this is an area where not much of a hike will take place in the coming quarter, because there is a good demand supply match that has been seen. And we expect that whatever profit that we have seen in the coal mines in the last one year that will virtually stabilise going forward. What we want to understand is that you would cut your FY27 PAT guidance, right. A, why is that? And then what are the revised targets? Because it seems like it was a sizable cut. I do not think we have cut our guidance for FY27. We still believe that this is a guidance that we will very much achieve. And if you see now, three years back, we had a profitability of only 1400 crores, leave aside the exceptional items. This year in three quarters itself, we are 3000 crores. So I think our profitability has increased by nearly three and a half times in the last three years. And we expect that this profitability will also double from the guidance that we had given in 2023 to double that number. And we are on track to achieve that. And you have seen that how our profitability has now stabilised. And this quarter, the satisfying thing is that our profitability has come from coal businesses. Unlike last year, where a lot of it came from the coal business which was a one time. And going forward, you will see all our businesses that is transmission distribution generation will continue to contribute. In fact, this quarter, 71% of our profit has come from our transmission distribution and renewable business. So I think we are doing very good in terms of consolidating and ensuring that our core businesses start giving us the profitability and thereby, it can be sustained in the long run. Okay, point taken. The reason we ask you that question is because in your earlier presentation, you had talked about how from FY22 levels, where the profitability was 2300 odd crores, you are planning to make it 4x, which comes around 8000 to 9000 crores versus the latest presentation, where the profitability is 3810 and you are expecting it to be 2x. So a little lower than what it was in the earlier presentation. But I think it is a small number at that. But I wanted to come back to the focus on the international businesses as well, because there was this maiden dividend from Zambian unit that came this time. And that supported the profits as well. Do you expect this kind of contribution to continue? And is this a fundamental asset for you that you would want to hold on? Are you looking at probably divesting a stake in some of these international assets?So as you were aware that the Indonesian asset was not performing well, and because of the challenges in the asset, we had taken it up with the government. So all our old payments, which is due to us, which is nearly 150 million dollars, 50 million has been received and the balance 100 we will get in next 12 to 18 months. Otherwise, this asset has been doing very well, because of the challenges in Zambia, we could not get the payment from the buyer of the power and also because the currency issues were there. Now that that has been sorted out, the plant is operating very well. And we will expect dividend flow from the operating plant as well as the old payments which are due to us, which we will receive in next 12 to 18 months. But since you talked about the Zambian unit, do you actually see a sustained contribution coming in from there?Sure, in the operating plant, we will get the sustained returns, apart from the old outstanding payments which will get paid in the tranches over the next 12 to 18 months.But I also wanted to shift focus and talk about your the captive solar module factory that you are going to commission very soon. I think part of it has already started, but the actual production is expected to start from Q2 of this calendar year. Could you talk to me about what kind of production are you envisaging and will it be 100% captive only because the prices in the external market has plummeted quite a bit.There are two parts of it. One is the manufacturing of plant, the module plant of four gigawatt out of which three has already been commissioned and the production has already started last week and it is now getting stabilised. So, we will definitely start seeing some returns in this quarter from the module manufacturing plant. The cell plant will get ready by first quarter of next financial year and it will stabilise by the second quarter. The cell plant output we will start getting from the next financial year. But the module plant is already operating and we will be supplying to our existing projects whether they are group captive projects or those are utility scale projects or even for that matter for our rooftop business. I think we are doing very good on the manufacturing facility and this is one of the fastest which has come within the country. The second aspect is the low cost of imported modules. As you are aware that the ALMM is only applicable till 31st March and import beyond that will not be allowed for utility scale projects and some of the other projects. So, I think we have very good opportunity to supply to the domestic users as well as to large projects which have the requirement of domestic component. So, the financials of the manufacturing plants are very well structured and we do expect that we will make good returns on this investment. On the net debt front, it had come below the mark of 40,000, but given the kind of capex you have lined up, what is the number that we should expect going forward on the net debt and secondly with respect to the EV infrastructure, the government is also planning to electrify the highways as well. Would you be a strong contender for that, making the highways into e-ways?Absolutely. First of all, on the EVs, we are the biggest player. We already have EVs installed at various locations right through the country and we have nearly 55% market share. And when you drive intercity, whether it is from Srinagar to Jammu or Jammu to Delhi, you would find our EV chargers. Similarly, between all major cities, we have EV chargers. So, we will play a very-very important role based on the government rollout plan. Secondly, all our businesses you would see will start giving very good results, having seen the type of investments that we have made in the last few quarters and whatever is planned in the next few quarters, our financial metrics whether it is the debt equity or it is the debt EBITDA will also be within the prudential norms. Today, we are at debt-equity of just one and even with the high investments that we are planning, we will not be crossing the 1.5, plus the internal accruals that will come from our existing operations will also support us in ensuring that our financial metrics are met. So, I think we are in a very good situation considering infrastructure company and many of our investments also will start generating revenue in the coming years.I think the Street was a bit disappointed about the pace of capacity addition that we have seen in the renewables business. Are you expecting a pickup soon? Was it just a momentary delay or there has been some shifting of plans because of which your renewable portfolio has not jumped up to the level that you had earlier envisaged? We will surprise you with what we will do in this quarter in the Q4 where we have nearly 1.2 gigawatt of projects lined up for completion and also in the subsequent quarters in Q1 and Q2 of FY25. As you are aware, there was a huge increase in prices in imported modules last year and that is why we had deferred some of the projects which I think on hindsight was the right decision, considering that the prices have come down in the last six months and we will take the benefit and implement most of the projects in the next two to three quarters.

        "articleBody": "India's top oil producer ONGC and the nation's biggest power firm NTPC on Wednesday signed a joint venture agreement to set up offshore wind energy projects as the two firms look to boost collaboration in renewable energy. The pact was signed during India Energy Week here.  The JVA marks a pivotal collaboration aimed at spearheading renewable energy projects both within India and on the international stage,  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said in a statement.  Specifically, the agreement encompasses ventures in offshore wind projects while also delving into potential opportunities in storage, e-mobility, carbon credits, green credits, green hydrogen business, and its derivatives such as green ammonia and green methanol.  The joint venture agreement was signed by NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL) CEO Mohit Bhargava, and ONGC executive director Satish Kumar Dwivedi. The signing took place in the presence of ONGC chairman and CEO Arun Kumar Singh and NTPC Limited chairman and managing director Gurdeep Singh. In December, ONGC received the government nod to set up a new unit to house its gas business and clean energy projects like green hydrogen, as it looked to fast-track foray into new areas. It has named the company ONGC Green Limited. The wholly-owned subsidiary company will be for value-chains of energy business such as green hydrogen, hydrogen blending, renewable energy (solar, wind and hybrid), biofuels/ biogas business and LNG, ONGC had said. The nation's largest oil and gas producer plans to spend Rs 1 lakh crore on installing 10 GW of renewable energy capacity, and setting up two million tonnes of green ammonia annual production capacity by 2035 as part of its decarbonisation strategy. ONGC's joint venture company with NTPC will look at projects in offshore wind energy and other renewal energy. ONGC had in September last year inked an agreement with NTPC Green Energy Limited for the development of renewable energy projects. The agreement envisaged collaborations on offshore wind projects and exploring opportunities in the storage, e-mobility, carbon credits and green credits, nuclear, green hydrogen business and its derivatives (green ammonia and green methanol). ONGC has a renewable portfolio of 176 MW, comprising 153 MW of wind power and 23 MW of solar. It is aiming to add 10 gigawatts of renewable power to its portfolio by 2040.",

Earlier, in July 2023, Aether Industries had commissioned a 16 MW solar power project (Fixed Modules) under the CPP segment and this new solar power plant under CPP will add to its renewable energy sources and further move towards sustainability, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.  The solar power farm will be in Gujarat's Bharuch District and spread across 60 acres. The phase-wise commissioning of the solar power plant is set to begin as early as the next financial year starting April, it stated.  However, the company did not mention the capex for the project.   As an enterprise, we are very cognizant of the elements that sustain life. This is why we are also part of UN Global Compact Network India to practice and promote sustainable manufacturing. Therefore, our decision to commission a fairly large solar park is in-line with that guiding philosophy. We will continue to explore ways to make Aether Industries a benchmark in sustainability within the chemicals industry in the country,  Aether Industries promoter and whole time director Rohan Desai said.",

        "articleBody": "Europe's green energy transition is stuck between a rock and a hard place. A flood of cheap Chinese solar panel imports is driving record solar energy installations. But those same imports are crushing Europe's few local solar manufacturers. Governments and industry are split over how to respond. Europe just had a bumper year for green energy. European Union countries installed record levels of solar capacity, 40% more than in 2022. The vast majority of those panels and parts came from China - in some cases, 95%, International Energy Agency data show. Yet the green energy boom hasn't helped Europe's few local solar panel manufacturers, which have hit crisis point, crushed by cheaper imports and oversupply. Announcements of production closures are piling up, and the sector has warned half of its capacity could shut within weeks unless governments step in. Policymakers are scrambling to respond, but are split over how to do so. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck wrote to the European Commission in November, expressing concern that the EU executive was about to slap trade restrictions on Chinese solar imports, a letter seen by Reuters showed.  I have heard that the Commission may be intending to impose safeguard measures against imports of photovoltaic (PV) modules from China. I have very strong concerns about this,  the letter said. Habeck warned restricting Chinese imports could kill off Europe's rapid expansion of green energy and make 90% of the PV market more expensive. It risked bankruptcies among EU companies that assemble and install solar panels using imported parts, he said. A spokesperson for Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on the letter. Germany's own planned support for the sector has been thrown into turmoil by a government budget crisis. Elsewhere, Spain has not ruled out tariffs on imports of solar panel materials. The Netherlands wants to cover solar PV imports with the EU's carbon border tax, a government official told Reuters. And Italy last week announced a 90 million euro ($97 million) investment in a PV panel factory in Sicily. PRICE WARIn a speech on Monday on the solar sector's problems, EU Financial Services Commissioner Mairead McGuinness offered no new support. She pointed to EU measures already underway, including a law due to be finalised on Tuesday, which aims to fast-track permits for local manufacturing and to give products made in the EU, such as panels, an advantage in future clean tech tenders. On trade restrictions, McGuinness struck a cautious tone.  Given that we currently rely to a very important degree on imports to reach EU solar deployment targets, any potential measure needs to be weighed against the objectives we have set ourselves when it comes to the energy transition,  she said. Industry itself is divided over the solution. Solar manufacturers have urged governments to step in to buy up excess inventories of solar modules to ease the oversupply - and, if this cannot be done fast, consider trade barriers. But the broader green energy industry is opposed to import curbs.  You can't reduce dependency on China in the short term or you don't build the projects,  Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade, CEO of Portuguese utility EDP, told Reuters. He noted that solar panel prices have climbed in the United States, which has duties on Chinese imports.  It is having an inflationary impact ... the price of panels is more than double that of Europe,  he said. Even local manufacturers say hopes of a competitive local industry are dim. Europe is in a  price war  with China, said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Swiss panel maker Meyer Burger, which plans to close its loss-making German solar module factory, citing an absence of supportive European policies. With some Chinese solar firms able to sell even below production costs, Europe is playing catch up.  The solar industry in China has been strategically subsidised with hundreds of billions of dollars for years,  Erfurt told Reuters.",

Bengaluru-based Ayana Renewable, which was incorporated in 2019, is majorly owned by National Infrastructure and Investment Fund, and had a 5 GW energy portfolio as on March, 2023. Hindalco, one of the largest producers of primary aluminium in the country, has manufacturing facilities in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. It has acquired stake in Ayana Renewable in cash on Wednesday, and the company will now be an associate company of Hindalco Industries, it said in an exchange filing. Aditya Aluminium at Sambalpur in Odisha is currently supported by coal power and has 360,000 tonnes of smelter capacity. Hindalco Industries plans to become net neutral on carbon by 2050. In 2022, it had signed a pact with Greenko Group to co-produce 375-400 MW of solar and wind power capacity. Smelting is high on carbon emissions, and requires continuous power supply. Local manufacturing companies, including those in the cement and steel space, are increasingly looking to increase the usage of renewable energy in their operations. In 2022-23 (Apr-Mar), Hindalco was named the most sustainable aluminium company in the world for the 3rd consecutive by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index rankings. Its renewable energy interaction was at more than 54% during the year at 150 MW, and the company has a target of 300 MW by 2025. Shares of Hindalco Industries closed at 579.90 rupees on the National Stock Exchange on Wednesday, down 0.6% from the previous close.",

        "articleBody": "US efforts to promote the expansion of India\u2019s solar industry may have opened a back door to components made with forced labor in China.India\u2019s largest solar producer, Waaree Energies Ltd., has sent millions of panels to the US with components from a Chinese company whose products were repeatedly denied entry to the US market over concerns about forced labor, a Bloomberg News examination of Indian and US import records shows. Those components, solar cells produced by China\u2019s Longi Green Energy Technology Co. at plants in Malaysia and Vietnam, are used in Waaree panels blanketing solar farms in Texas and other states.Imports of Waaree panels raise questions about how US Customs and Border Protection officials are enforcing a ban on products tied to the repression of Uyghur people in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. The agency has detained thousands of shipments of solar panels made by Chinese-owned companies since it began enforcing the ban in June 2022 \u2014 interventions that companies can overturn by providing evidence their supply chains don\u2019t involve Xinjiang sources.That focus on China has created an opportunity for Indian solar producers, which exported almost $2 billion worth of panels to the US in the first 11 months of last year, a fivefold increase over all of 2022, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF.\u201cEven panels that say, \u2018Made in India\u2019 are likely to be affected by Uyghur forced labor,\u201d Laura Murphy, co-author of an August 2023 report about the solar supply chain, said in October before being named a Customs enforcement adviser at the Department of Homeland Security. Her report said that because polysilicon from multiple sources in China is often blended together, there\u2019s a \u201cvery high\u201d risk that panels made at Longi factories in Southeast Asia had used at least some materials from Xinjiang.Longi, the world\u2019s largest solar producer, based in Xi\u2019an, China, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The company has said, in response to Murphy\u2019s report, that it has created a separate supply chain for the US market that uses material only from non-Chinese sources.Sunil Rathi, Waaree\u2019s sales director, said in an emailed statement that the Indian firm \u201chas been complying with the law of the land wherever we operate.\u201d He said its customers \u201chave stringent requirements, and they make sure we meet those for every shipment.\u201dGlobal concerns that Chinese officials were incarcerating or forcing members of the Uyghur minority to work in factories led Congress to enact the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, known as UFLPA, in December 2021. The Chinese government has denied any human rights violations in Xinjiang, saying its policies there are aimed at education, eradicating extremism and alleviating poverty.Some members of Congress and industry groups have criticized Customs for uneven enforcement of the law, which covers a range of products from tomatoes to shoes. The value of apparel and textiles detained for inspection by Customs in the first seven months of 2023 dropped 52% from the previous seven months, according to the National Council of Textile Organizations, which analyzed data from the agency. At the same time, the value of intercepted electronics shipments rose 6%.A spokesperson for Customs said the bureau \u201cemploys a dynamic, risk-based approach to enforcement that prioritizes action against the highest-risk goods based on a dynamic data and intelligence environment.\u201dThe bureau\u2019s website shows that since June 2022 Customs has detained $2 billion worth of products categorized as electronics, which industry analysts say are primarily solar panels. After reviewing supply-chain documents, officials barred about one-quarter of the total for violating the UFLPA.Customs doesn\u2019t identify the companies affected by these actions, which took place even as US imports of solar products reached a record high last year. The agency\u2019s data show that US officials have concentrated enforcement efforts on solar products from Southeast Asia, where Chinese companies including Longi shifted production a decade ago in part to avoid US tariffs.Longi has acknowledged the impact. In a September earnings call, Chairman Zhong Baoshen cited \u201ca massive impairment\u201d as a result of Customs officials denying US entry for its products. \u201cSince they cannot enter the United States, we need to process the returns of these products and resell them globally,\u201d he said.Since then, some Longi shipments have been getting through, Philip Shen, an analyst at investment bank Roth Capital Partners, wrote in an October note, suggesting that the company was making progress in its efforts to establish a US supply chain that doesn\u2019t rely on Chinese polysilicon.No shipments from Indian companies are known to have been detained, according to Pol Lezcano, a solar industry analyst at BloombergNEF.\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical, and it\u2019s targeted at the big Chinese companies,\u201d Lezcano said of US enforcement. \u201cIf you are a big, China-headquartered company, the likelihood your shipment gets detained at the border is higher.\u201dIndian products made up 9.3% of the volume of US solar imports in the first 11 months of last year, up from 1.9% in all of 2022, according to BNEF data. Imports jumped to 4.4 gigawatts \u2014 or about 11 million panels \u2014 in the first 11 months of 2023, up from 0.6 gigawatts in 2022, the data show. Most of that came from Waaree.China produces more than 80% of the world\u2019s polysilicon, which is used to make solar panels, and Chinese companies make roughly 98% of all ingots and wafers. About one-third of China\u2019s polysilicon capacity is in Xinjiang, according to BNEF, compared with 54% of production before the ban. But there isn\u2019t enough non-Chinese polysilicon to meet the demand, meaning some producers need to source polysilicon from China, Lezcano said.\u201cCBP doesn\u2019t have the resources or capacity to fully implement\u201d the Xinjiang imports ban, said Shannon O\u2019Neil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who has written about global supply chains. \u201cIt has had to pick and choose cases, and in the choosing of cases, it sure looks like geopolitics is in play.\u201dThe Biden administration has been trying to foster alternative supply chains in countries considered allies, a policy it calls friendshoring, to counter Chinese manufacturing dominance. On a visit to India in 2022, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke about US support for India\u2019s solar manufacturing industry, including $500 million in debt financing for the largest US solar maker\u2019s plans to open a plant there. She cited the need to diversify away from China, where solar materials \u201clike those from the Xinjiang region are known to be produced with forced labor.\u201dRead More: Secrecy and Abuse Claims Haunt China\u2019s Solar Factories in XinjiangThe US first banned polysilicon from Xinjiang in 2021, when it was placed on list of goods deemed to have been produced by forced labor. The US began enforcing the UFLPA the following year. Under that law, US officials apply what\u2019s called a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d that products linked to Xinjiang were made with forced labor.Importers can challenge that determination by supplying documentation showing their supply chains don\u2019t rely on polysilicon from Xinjiang. But polysilicon has been co-mingled with material from other parts of China, making such proof difficult.The polysilicon production process entails mining quartz, then crushing and heating it to produce metallurgical grade silicon, known as MGS. That material is refined into polysilicon, which is melted into ingots, then turned into wafers and ultimately solar cells that make up solar panels.MGS and polysilicon from different Chinese locations are often blended, which could introduce Xinjiang-sourced material \u201cinto any batch made by a company sourcing any amount\u201d of it from the region, according to \u201cOver-Exposed,\u201d the report by Murphy, who is also a professor at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, and solar consultant Alan Crawford.A 2021 US State Department advisory cited evidence of coercive labor practices at each stage in China\u2019s solar supply chain. \u201cThe pervasiveness of forced labor programs in Xinjiang and co-mingling of solar-grade polysilicon supplies by downstream manufacturers raise concerns throughout the entire solar supply chain,\u201d the advisory said. As a result, it\u2019s likely that \u201cthe majority of global solar products may continue to have a connection to forced labor.\u201dIndustry analysts draw similar conclusions. \u201cWe believe, based on our ongoing industry research, that smaller solar module manufacturers outside of China, including in India and Southeast Asia, are using material inputs from China that are possibly, and in some cases likely, exposed to forced labor while continuing to export to the US,\u201d said Reginald Smith, a solar industry analyst at Eventide Asset Management in Boston.The \u201cOver-Exposed\u201d report compiled publicly available records, corporate annual reports, press releases, customs data, email exchanges with companies and other sources.The report included a supply-chain map showing links between Xinjiang-sourced polysilicon and Longi\u2019s factories in Southeast Asia. But a rebuttal map provided by Longi and included in the report said the company had created a separate supply chain for the US that uses polysilicon only from non-Chinese sources.Neither that claim nor Murphy\u2019s could be independently confirmed. But Longi modules containing polysilicon produced in China were among those that Customs officials denied entry to the US market, according to a July note by Roth Capital\u2019s Shen. Modules containing polysilicon from other sources may have been among Longi shipments that US authorities later released, Roth wrote in another note in September.Indian customs records compiled by trade data aggregator ImportGenius and reviewed by Bloomberg show that Waaree has received hundreds of shipments of solar cells, which convert light into electrical energy for solar panels, from Longi-owned plants in Malaysia and Vietnam since mid-2022.India, which has limited capacity to produce its own solar inputs, has ambitious plans to build a vertically integrated manufacturing industry to take advantage of opportunities in the US market and at home. Waaree has three plants in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and has announced plans to tap government incentives and expand production capacity over the next two years, as well as to develop its own solar cell and wafer manufacturing. It is planning to open a plant near Houston later this year and is seeking approval for an initial public offering to raise as much as 30 billion rupees ($362 million).Longi also has plans to manufacture in the US. It recently started module production at a facility in Ohio, a venture with Chicago-based renewables firm Invenergy.Waaree products have been shipped to residential and commercial solar providers in California, North Carolina and Texas, including the Red-Tailed Hawk and Danish Fields solar farms near Houston, US import records show. Neither project responded to requests for comment, and it couldn\u2019t be confirmed independently whether the components of those panels were made with materials from Xinjiang.India is poised to further expand its US solar market share this year, when anti-dumping and countervailing duty tariffs on solar products from Southeast Asia come into effect in June.Eric Choy, the top Customs official in charge of UFLPA enforcement, said at a June webinar organized by risk-intelligence firm Kharon that third-country risk \u201cis probably the highest risk that\u2019s out there.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The government is looking to increase the subsidy for rooftop solar projects for households to 60% of the capital cost from 40% currently, aiming at lower and lower middle class, power minister RK Singh said on Friday.  We intend to increase the subsidy and probably it would be around 60%. Right now, it is about 40%,  Singh said. FM Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech had stated that 10 million households will be enabled to get up to 300 units of free electricity under the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana - the new solar rooftop scheme.  The scheme will focus on those households whose consumption is less than 300 units, which generally includes the economically weaker section. For them, going and applying for a loan is a problem,  Singh said.Power sector public enterprises will form special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in the states assigned to them for implementing the projects.107370731ET had reported on January 15 that the government is planning to enlist state-run power sector companies such as NTPC, NHPC, Power Grid Corporation and SJVN, along with four others for implementing the rooftop solar scheme, with REC Ltd as the nodal agency.There are two parts to the implementation of the scheme. In one, the SPVs will reach out to consumers having up to 3kW of load and the 40% non-subsidised portion of the capital cost would be loaned by the SPV. The excess power units that will be generated through the rooftop solar project on such households, monitored through virtual net metering, will go towards paying off the loan by the SPV.  As per our calculation the loan will be paid off in 10 years,  Singh said. For households above 300 units or 2.5 -3kW load, the subsidy will remain the same at 40%, while the loan for rest of the investment will be available from any bank. The project can be set up by the SPV, if required. The Central Electricity Authority will maintain an oversight so that the SPVs don't charge any extra margin.",

        "articleBody": "In a strategic move to enhance solar power generation, the Delhi government is set to conduct rooftop assessments through satellite imagery. This pioneering initiative aims to analyze the shadow and sunlight patterns throughout the year, ensuring accurate calculations of power generation potential.Innovative Approach to Solar AssessmentUnder the newly passed Delhi Solar Policy 2024, residents are encouraged to install solar panels on their rooftops. To facilitate this, the government will collaborate with organizations utilizing satellite imaging for a precise assessment of the city's rooftops. Power Minister Atishi highlighted the significance, stating,  This will assist the consumer, who has difficulty determining how much solar panel space he needs to install on his roof. Holistic Information PortalTo further streamline the solar adoption process, the state government plans to launch a comprehensive portal. This platform will feature details of empanelled agencies specializing in solar panel installations, providing consumers with valuable information. The initiative aims to bridge the information gap, enabling consumers to make informed decisions about solar installations.Consumer-Friendly Solar PolicyThe Delhi Solar Policy 2024 offers residents various incentives for embracing solar power. These include generation-based incentives, capital subsidies, and the opportunity to sell excess electricity to other consumers in real time. The emphasis is not solely on the rooftop's size but also on identifying areas free from shadows for optimal electricity production.In a TOI report, an official explained,  The electricity production depends not just on the size of the rooftop but also on areas that remain shadow free for an adequate period.  This holistic approach ensures that consumers can maximize their solar power potential.Empowering Consumers Through InformationTo increase awareness and understanding of the policy, the government will organize camps where residents, particularly those from Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), can learn about the benefits, guidelines, and qualified vendors related to solar installations. In the same TOI report, the official emphasized,  Many people are not showing an interest in this for lack of awareness. But once they hear about the details, they will certainly show more interest. Revised Incentives Under the 2024 PolicyThe Delhi Solar Policy 2024 revises the incentives provided to consumers. While the 2016 policy offered Rs 2 per unit for solar generation, the new policy increases the incentive to Rs 3 per unit for small rooftop plants and Rs 2 per unit for larger plants. Notably, the new policy eliminates the riders on minimum generation necessary to receive Generation-Based Incentives (GBI).Extending Incentives to Commercial and Industrial ConsumersIn a groundbreaking move, the Delhi government has decided to extend GBI to commercial and industrial consumers for the first time. Businesses installing up to the first 200 MW of solar installations in Delhi will receive an incentive of one rupee per unit of solar power generated for five years.Community Solar Model IntroducedThe Delhi Solar Policy 2024 introduces innovative deployment models, including community solar for consumers facing constraints in funds or rooftop space. This pioneering concept allows consumers to be part of a community-owned solar system installed at a third-party location, providing benefits even without suitable rooftops.Positive Responses from Power CompaniesLeading power companies, including Tata Power and BSES, have welcomed the policy. A Tata Power official highlighted the financial benefits, stating,  The income generated from solar plants as excess units are compensated by the discom at the unit rate of that specific customer segment.  BSES expressed their commitment to rooftop solar promotion, with plans to energize over 1,000 rooftop solar connections in 2024-25.The Delhi government's adoption of satellite imaging for solar assessments and the comprehensive solar policy for residents and businesses mark a significant step towards a sustainable and energy-efficient future.(With inputs from TOI)",

        "articleBody": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's interim budget was free of electoral compulsions against popular expectations and political calculations ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Given the inevitable political implications of all economic measures, many budget proposals can impact politics, as well as elections, in various ways. One particular proposal, as and when it turns into reality, can have a far-reaching impact on India's electoral politics.For long, a persistent theme in India's electoral politics has been freebies, and the king of freebies is free electricity. Often, promises of free electricity have swung elections. Several political parties have wielded this weapon with great effect, and once free power is granted, no other political party later can dare to stop it. Free power is seen as a key factor behind poll victories of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab as well as Delhi. In fact, free electricity has been a prominent issue in Punjab for decades where farming requires lots of water which is pumped out of ground. High across-the-board subsidies to pump out groundwater for agriculture use have played havoc with the power distribution business while also depleting the ground water as well as encouraging use of water-intensive crops, thus harming long-term agricultural prospects of the state. As part of competitive populism, free power often becomes a potent weapon for many opposition parties. A scheme in the interim budget, if it gets implemented effectively and has high adoption, can change the free electricity narrative in the long run.The promise of 300 units of free electricityThe interim budget has proposed a rooftop solar scheme for 10 million households which will be enabled to get up to 300 units of free electricity every month under the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana with an outlay of Rs 10,000 crore.Sitharaman said the scheme would lead to savings of Rs 15,000-18,000 annually for each household from free solar electricity and selling the surplus under the programme. With rooftop solar, electric vehicles too can be charged, she said. This scheme follows the resolve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost solar power generation on the day of consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, she said.The scheme will also provide entrepreneurship opportunities for a large number of vendors for supply and installation as well as employment opportunities for the youth with technical skills in manufacturing, installation and maintenance. This scheme is meant to help poor and middle-income households, numbering one crore, lower their electricity bills.A grid-connected rooftop solar system makes for great efficiency since it has a low gestation period, needs no additional transmission and distribution (T&D) lines, reduces T&D losses, and helps management of daytime peak loads by power utilities. It will reduce burden on electricity distribution companies as well as lower the use of fossil fuel such as coal.The political economy of free powerLast month, the deep financial crisis of Telangana\u2019s power utilities came to light. While the discoms in the state have racked up losses of Rs 50,275 crore in the last 10 years, borrowings from banks and financial institutions swelled to Rs 81,000 crore, TOI reported. Nearly Rs 30,000 crore of these borrowings was taken towards power purchase from various states and generating companies, energy department officials had told Chief Minister Revanth Reddy. While claiming the government will have to spend another Rs 4,000 crore to provide free power up to 200 units to domestic consumers, officials said they were struggling to pay 1,300 crore towards interest and installments for repayment of loans.Telangana is not alone to have shown up the economic impact of free power. Free electricity began its journey as a potent electoral device decades ago, mainly to subsidise farmers, and a variety of parties have tried it. However, it ended up ruining the power distribution business in several states as debts mounted. Also, free power for one set of consumers would often mean no or less power for many others. Though the Electricity Act mandates that states make upfront payments to discoms for the free electricity, this is a norm observed regularly in its breach, ET has argued. Free electricity schemes are capacity agnostic -- all households, irrespective of their ability to pay, are beneficiaries. Studies show that the amount of free electricity offered is often in excess of median electricity consumption. It distorts demand and efficient use, and creates a barrier to key reforms such as eliminating cross-subsidy of domestic and agricultural consumers by commercial and industrial users. Thereby, electrification of the economy is actually inhibited. It reinforces perverse incentives to coal-based electricity production, disincentivising greening of electricity sources.While providing free electricity to deserving consumers could actually be a productive measure, supporting them in their fragile enterprises or helping the poor cut their household bills, it has been argued that instead of subsidising the discom, the subsidy should be paid as direct benefit transfer to eligible consumers.Will the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana help matters? It is a preliminary step and much depends on the adoption and implementation over years. Since solar power is an emerging sector, it may take a long time for such schemes to show impact on the ground.Where does the scheme fit into India's solar ambitions?The scheme may have long-term impact on India's politics but it is intended as a means to promote India's renewable energy goals. The promised benefits to households are aimed at incentivising adoption. India has set a target of having 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and have 50 percent of installed power generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources. According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water, 20-25 gigawatts of rooftop solar capacity could be supported through the solarisation of one crore households. The government's aim is to achieve 40 GW of rooftop solar capacity by 2025-26.In FY20, India had total solar installed capacity of nearly 35 GW which rose to nearly 67 GW in FY 23 and is expected to touch nearly 73 GW in the current financial year.(With inputs from TOI and agencies)",

I have taken my first decision after returning from Ayodhya that our government will launch 'Pradhan Mantri Suryoday Yojna' with the aim to install rooftop solar systems in one crore houses,  Modi had said on X.  Sitharaman in her interim Budget speech said through rooftop solarisation, one crore households will be enabled to obtain up to 300 units of free electricity each month.  This scheme follows the resolve of the Prime Minister on the historic day of consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, she said.  Talking about the benefits, she informed the House that there will be  savings up to Rs 15,000-18,000 annually for households from free solar electricity and selling the surplus to the distribution companies.   The scheme will also aid charging of electric vehicles; entrepreneurship opportunities for a large number of vendors for supply and installation and employment opportunities for the youth with technical skills in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.  Talking about India's commitment for 'net-zero' by 2070, she announced a viability gap funding for harnessing offshore wind energy.   Viability gap funding will be provided for harnessing offshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of 1 GW,  she said.  According to the Central Electricity Authority data, India has a solar energy-installed generation capacity of over 73 GW.  Similarly, the data showed that wind energy capacity in the country stood around 45 GW while large hydro (over 25 MW capacity each) is 47 GW.  The biomass power/cogen capacity about 10 GW and that of small hydro (up to 25 MW) is around 5 GW, while the waste-to-energy capacity stood at 583 MW.  India has set a target of having 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and have 50 per cent of installed power generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources.  President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said in her joint address to the Members of Parliament that in 10 years, non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity has increased from 81 GW to 188 GW.   During this period, solar power capacity has increased 26 times. Similarly, wind power capacity has doubled. We are placed at fourth in the world in terms of renewable energy installed capacity. We are ranked fourth in wind power capacity. We are at fifth position in solar power capacity,  she said.Inputs from PTI",

This was part of the plan to hit 100 gigawatts of solar power generation by 2022.The 2022 target was missed, as solar power generation touched only 63.3 GW. By the end of 2023, solar power generation hit 73 GW. Of the 100 GW of solar power, 40 GW was supposed to be from solar panels installed on rooftops. But by the end of 2023, rooftop solar energy generation was just 11 GW.The government, in January, increased benchmark central financial assistance for the residential sector under the rooftop solar program to give a push to the projects and cover the higher cost of solar panels.Support for up to 3 kW capacity was raised to Rs 18,000 per kW for general states, up 23.4%, from Rs 14,588 per kW earlier, according to a notification from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.For over 3kW and up to 10 kW capacity, the assistance has been raised to Rs 9,000 per kW for general states from Rs 7,294 per kW.",

Under the Delhi Solar Policy 2024, consumers who opt for solar power generation will be financially rewarded. The scheme is likely to be notified in the next 10 days. We have issued a new solar policy today - Solar Policy 2024. We formed the government (in Delhi) in 2015 and after that, we launched the Solar Policy 2016. That was considered as the most progressive solar policy in the country, and it laid the foundation of solar power in Delhi,  said Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal at a press conference. Also Read - Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana: What is it, who is eligible Delhi government has released a new solar policy, Solar Policy 2024. Till now the policy of 2016 was in force, it was the most progressive policy in the country... Electricity is free up to 200 units in Delhi, half up to 400 units and above that the full bill is charged. Under the new solar policy, those who install solar panels on their rooftop will have zero electricity bills, no matter how many units of electricity they consume. With this, you can earn Rs 700-900 every month,  Kejriwal added while making announcement about the scheme.The policy also mandates the installation of rooftop solar panels in all government buildings with an area of 500 square metres within the next three years. Atishi, the Power Minister of Delhi, revealed that the solar policy was recently approved by the Cabinet and will be officially implemented within the next 10 days.It is worth noting that the Delhi government's 2016 policy has already resulted in the deployment of over 250 MW of rooftop solar plants and 1,250 MW of utility-scale solar plants, contributing to a total of 1,500 MW. This impressive figure meets approximately 7.2% of Delhi's annual electricity demand.The new Delhi scheme comes in the backdrop of Centre announcing a new rooftop solar scheme. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 22 announced the \u201cPradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana\u201d with a target of installing rooftop solar on 1 crore houses.Pradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana aims to provide electricity to low and middle-income individuals through solar rooftop installations, along with offering additional income for surplus electricity generation.The Prime Minister also directed that a massive national campaign should be started to mobilize residential segment consumers to adopt rooftop solar in large numbers.",

We have been ready to do the groundbreaking, but we have put the project on hold at this point of time to re-evaluate the business viability for some more time,  Prashant Jain, managing director of JSW Energy, told analysts in the firm's third-quarter earnings call.  We have seen in the last quarter that the panel prices have been dipping close to single digits, something around $0.10 to $0.11,  he said.JSW Renewable Technologies, a wholly owned step-down subsidiary of JSW Energy, was allocated a performance-linked incentive (PLI) for quoted manufacturing capacity of 1 gw wafer+cell+module in March last year. The company planned to backward integrate and de-risk its supply chain to aid its growth plans. The strategic intent was to use this capacity for captive consumption in building renewable energy projects by JSW Neo Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary JSWRTL was eligible for \u20b9320 crore of PLI benefits and the awarded capacity had to be operational by April 2025. The solar panel prices from $0.27-$0.30 are falling back to close to $0.10. We are just trying to reassess the situation,  Jain said.  It is not only the panel prices which has made us think this way, (but) it is also the kind of a velocity at which this turbulence has happened. So, we want to understand what are the core reasons for this, and then we need to look at it. China, which is the world's solar module powerhouse and commands 80% of global manufacturing capacity, has seen the cost of solar module production drop by 42% in the last 12 months to $0.15 per watt.",

This is his first scheme after the consecretion ceremony. Today, on the auspicious occasion of consecration in Ayodhya, my resolution got further strengthened that the people of India should have their own solar roof top system on the roof of their houses. The first decision I have taken after returning from Ayodhya is that our government will launch \u201cPradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana\u201d with the target of installing rooftop solar on 1 crore houses,  Modi tweeted.Also Read: Can India meet 2026 solar rooftop target? This will not only reduce the electricity bill of the poor and middle class, but will also make India self-reliant in the energy sector,  he further added.He posted pictures of him discussing the scheme with officials here following his return from Ayodhya where he attended the consecration ceremony.Devotees across the world always draw energy from the light of  suryavanshi  Lord Ram, he said.The Indian government, under Prime Minister Modi, introduced the first solar scheme with an ambitious target of achieving 1GW of solar power by 2022. However, as the deadline approached, it became evident that India would fall short of its goals. By 2022, the country had only managed to generate 63.3 GW of solar power capacity, a fraction of the initial target. Furthermore, the intended objective of attaining 40GW of rooftop solar power by 2022 was also not met. Instead, by the end of 2023, the country had only achieved a modest 11 GW of rooftop solar energy generation. Solar energy plays a crucial role in India's aspirations to generate 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. It is a vital component in the country's efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and combat climate change. Rooftop solar energy holds great promise for consumers, as it has the potential to contribute significantly to overall power cost reduction and enhance energy security. Additionally, it can greatly improve access to electricity in remote and hilly regions like the Northeast, where uninterrupted power supply from the grid is often a challenge.",

        "articleBody": "Every Ram Navami, Ram Lalla will get a  Surya Tilak . An intricate network of lenses and mirrors will be used in the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram temple in Ayodhya to channel a ray of sunlight on the forehead of Ram Lalla at 12 noon for about six minutes on the ninth day of the Chaitra month which marks Lord Ram's birth. The  Surya Tilak  system has been designed by scientists from CSIR and Central Building Research Institute. This act of devotion and innovation also carries a ray of inspiration for India's future. While laying foundation stones and inaugurating projects worth \u20b915,000 crore at Ayodhya a few weeks ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Bharat aspires not just to protect its heritage and tradition, but also to make impressive strides in development, be it digital technology or reaching the moon. Ram Lalla's  Surya Tilak  harks back to a religious legend of Lord Rama's lineage going back to the Sun god, while it looks ahead at India's renewable energy goals for which solar energy plays a significant role, given the abundance of sunlight in the country most of the year.Ayodhya, the capital of the SuryavanshFittingly, Ayodhya is being developed into a solar city, not only as a model for other cities but also as a bow to the 'Suryavansh' (the solar lineage) of Lord Rama.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, while personally inspecting solar energy projects in Ayodhya last year, said,  Ayodhya is the capital of Suryavansh. So, here, electricity will come not from other sources but from renewable solar energy. Lord Rama was born in the Ikshvaku dynasty which was founded by King Ikshvaku. The sun is considered the progenitor of the dynasty and those belonging to the dynasty are called 'suryavanshi'. Ayodhya is considered the capital of the Suryavansh.Ayodhya as a solar cityWork has been underway on a war footing to develop Ayodhya as Uttar Pradesh's first  solar city  ahead of the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple.The plan includes developing a solar park along the banks of the Saryu, providing solar-powered boats, installing solar streetlights, adoption of solar energy sources in public transport, providing solar-powered amenities such as mobile charging points at public places along with electrification of government buildings using solar energy and improving penetration of solar power for domestic use.The project is part of Uttar Pradesh's ambitious Solar Energy Policy 2022. An important aspect of the plan is to develop 16 municipal corporations and Noida as  solar cities .  The plan is to develop Ayodhya as the model for the solar city project and use the learnings in the implementation of solar policies in other proposed cities,  Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Department Director Anupam Shukla told PTI, last year.While the solar city project is a five-year plan (2023-28), facilities such as streetlights, installation of solar panels at government buildings, e-rickshaws with charging stations, solar trees, and solar energy-powered purifiers for drinking water kiosks are to be covered in the first phase.The work also includes installing solar panels on the rooftops of 117 government buildings, totalling 2.5 MW. This includes a 250 kW solar panel installed at RML Awadh University, a 155 kW panel at Agriculture University, a 100 kW capacity panel at the district court, a 58 kW panel at Ram Katha Museum, and 50 kW panels at different government secondary schools.About 42 parks in Ayodhya would be illuminated through solar power. The government is going to install solar trees in the parks, taking forward the vision to deploy renewable energy sources as far as possible in the temple town. The solar streetlights will be installed along the famous Ram Path \u2014 the 12.9-kilometre, six-lane road that leads to the temple from Sahadatganj on the Lucknow-Ayodhya National Highway and up to the Lata Mangeshkar Chowk in the Nayaghat area. This apart, 800 solar streetlights have also been installed in the city.The biggest piece of the solar city project is the installation of a 40 MW solar plant on the banks of the Saryu, to be established by NTPC Green.",

        "articleBody": "When the Narendra Modi government announced in 2015 that it was ramping up India\u2019s solar power generation target from 22 gigawatts to 100 gigawatts (1 GW is 1,000 MW) by 2022, it was considered an impressive but audacious goal. At the time, the country was generating just 4,000 MW. The 2022 target was missed, as solar power generation touched only 63.3 GW. By the end of 2023, solar power generation hit 73 GW. However, one part of India\u2019s solar energy ambition still fell considerably short\u2014rooftop power generation. Of the 100 GW of solar power, 40 GW was supposed to be from solar panels installed on rooftops. But by the end of 2023, rooftop solar energy generation was just 11 GW. And energy generated from residences was only about a fifth of that. Sectoral experts are not sure if the new deadline of March 2026 for rooftop solar energy will be met despite a slew of recent incentives and policy measures.    107017952Solar energy is an important constituent of India\u2019s ambitions of generating 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. With overall solar energy generation getting traction in the last few years\u2014capacity additions nearly doubled from 6,510 MW in 2019-20 to 12,760 MW in 2021-22\u2014would it matter if rooftop generation is lagging, as long as the overall target is met?   107017954From the point of view of consumers as well as the overall cost of power and energy security, rooftop solar will play a significant role, says Neeraj Kuldeep, senior programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), who researches solar and wind energy markets. \u201cIndia aims to provide affordable power to consumers 24x7. Affordability will come from rooftop solar because the technology cost is continuously declining. Once you install the system, the cost of power is set for the next 25-30 years whereas the cost of electricity from the grid will keep rising,\u201d he says.    107017958Rooftop solar will also improve access to electricity in remote, hilly regions such as areas in the Northeast that might not have uninterrupted power from the grid. Vibhuti Garg, director \u2013South Asia, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), says there is a big push to set up large-scale power utilities but we have to use the potential of decentralised renewable energy (energy generated off the grid, close to the site of consumption, like rooftop solar) because we have limited land in India. COST-EFFECTIVE OR COSTLY? Bengaluru resident Kochu Sankar G had been looking to install rooftop solar panels ever since he saw similar systems when he visited Melbourne. He got a 3 kW system a year ago, which brought down his monthly power bills from Rs 2,000-2,500 to Rs 100-200. He estimates that he will be able to recover his investment of Rs 1.6 lakh (net of subsidy) in about three more years.  I\u2019ve also reduced my dependence on the discom and my load on the government has come down considerably,\u201d says the 64-yearold retiree, who is now a rooftop solar enthusiast.    107017973For Delhi-based IT professional Nabeela Hamid, the motivation for installing rooftop solar panels was to reduce power bills in her new home, which would have air conditioners in most rooms, and to offset the emissions from it. Installing a 5 kW rooftop solar system last year for about Rs 3.5 lakh (excluding a government subsidy of Rs 50,000), has brought down the five-member household\u2019s power bill from Rs 3,500 at the peak of summer to zero. Apart from a couple of months\u2019 delay in getting the subsidy, the process was seamless, she says. Despite the satisfaction expressed by people like Sankar and Hamid, data shows they are in a minority. One reason for this, say analysts, is the lack of awareness among consumers and discoms. At the national level, consumer awareness about rooftop solar energy was less than 50%, with awareness in most states at 30-50%, a November 2023 survey by CEEW found.    107017979Even if consumers might be aware of solar energy generation, there is still lack of awareness about the technology, how to get government subsidy and net metering (a method by which your bill is lowered by deducting the electricity your system produces from the electricity your home consumes), among others, says CEEW\u2019s Kuldeep. The government needs to promote awareness among discoms as well, says Pranav Master, senior practice director\u2013consulting, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s very critical to help both sides understand the nuances of rooftop, including advantages, regulations and processes.\u201d he says.  A representative of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy even told the parliamentary standing committee on energy that a main problem in implementing the rooftop programme was that discoms were not ready to let go of high-paying commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers, according to the panel\u2019s 2022-23 report. \u201cFor large commercial and industrial customers, awareness and adoption levels are very high. The biggest gap in the industry is that by volume, the bulk of the demand is in millions of homes and hundreds of thousands of MSMEs, in which I would include commercial establishments like restaurants and hospitals,\u201d says Gagan Vermani, founderCEO of solar rooftop startup MYSUN.    107018031 The high initial cost of setting up a system also pinches residential customers. \u201cPower tariff in India is hugely subsidised for residential consumers so it is not very commercially viable for them to put large systems on their rooftop. The tariff is much higher for commercial customers, which is why that sector has picked up,\u201d says IEEFA\u2019s Garg. The cost of a rooftop system with solar panels for 2-3 kW, which is what a middle-income household that does not use air conditioners would need, would cost Rs 1-1.5 lakh. Then there is a lack of sufficient, affordable financing options. \u201cDedicated NBFCs are needed to bridge the gap of quick financing for solar projects, though interest rates will still not be as low as what traditional banks charge,\u201d says Vermani.     107017999With power being a state subject, policies vary, which is also why a state like Gujarat is far ahead in terms of rooftop solar energy generation than others. BOOSTER SHOTS The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has been introducing changes to policies and incentives in its bid to improve the offtake of rooftop solar energy, especially among residential customers. For one, the introduction of a dedicated national portal for rooftop solar in 2022 has helped streamline the process. \u201cI used the national portal and felt the whole experience very seamless and efficient, with everything done online,\u201d says Dheeraj S, a Bengaluru based software developer who got a rooftop solar system installed last year. Favourable differential between grid tariff and the cost of rooftop solar, particularly for C&I consumers, renewable energy procurement targets by corporates and favourable policies in some states have led to increased traction, says CRISIL\u2019s Master. This is expected to take capacity addition to over 3 GW this fiscal year.     107018034\u201cThe good thing is, year after year and at a rapid pace, we are seeing these obstacles reducing\u2014 both in the number and quantum of resistance in each of these areas, says Vermani, whose firm, he says, is seeing 20-25% growth in demand month-on-month. Most recently, the government increased the central financial assistance for the residential sector, by close to 25% for the 3 kW and below category. ET also reported that the government plans to enlist state-run power companies to offset the cost of installation. However, \u201cthere\u2019s still significant upside potential in terms of rooftop solar penetration,\u201d says Master, who highlighted that the operational structure of the proposed plan and exact role of PSUs is a key monitorable. He adds: \u201cCapacity building and awareness sessions as well as favourable connectivity options such as virtual/group net metering and peer-to-peer trading are critical to boost rooftop solar capacity additions.\u201d     107018006Virtual/ group net metering would allow customers to allocate excess energy to other sites and among multiple consumers via a billing software. CEEW\u2019s Kuldeep suggests the ministry needs to embark on an awareness campaign along the lines of the pulse polio campaign to reach consumers everywhere. He adds that there should be increased access to affordable finance via solar loans at cheaper interest rates with longer tenure. A harder bullet to bite will be reducing the power subsidy for residential customers, which acts as a disincentive, particularly for those consuming less power. Instead of waiving or subsidising power bills, state governments could provide rooftop solar systems to households, he says. \u201cThe government will recover that amount in 5-7 years and it will no longer have to provide subsidies. This way, they will break the chain of giving power subsidies to consumers.\u201d The various hurdles, though, are not a dampener for new solar energy targets. The Uttar Pradesh government, for instance, is looking to install solar rooftop systems on 25,000 houses in Prime Minister Modi\u2019s constituency of Varanasi in two months\u2014before the general elections\u2014at the behest of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, according to media reports. The race to \u201csolarise\u201d is on.",

        "articleBody": "Thiruvananthapuram: In a technological milestone, scientists at CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science & Technology (CSIR-NIIST) here have set a new efficiency record of 35.6 per cent in indoor light harvesting using dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). This can provide a sustainable alternative to one-time use primary batteries and also reduce environmental pollution. The technological feat has received global recognition as its details have been published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's Journal of Materials Chemistry A, a statement said here. C Anandharamakrishnan, Director of CSIR-NIIST, said the integration of DSCs into IoT (Internet of Things) systems offers a sustainable solution by creating self-powered devices that operate for extended periods without the need for battery replacements.  It will reduce the environmental pollution resulting from the disposal of billions of dead and used batteries annually. It will be a boon for consumer electronics and portable devices , he said. This remarkable feat marks a significant advancement in indoor photovoltaic technology as DSCs are emerging as the leading indoor light-harvesting technology, he added. Their unique semi-transparent nature, coupled with an array of colours and designs, opens up avenues for innovative applications, including integration into glass facades, greenhouses and architectural installations within indoor spaces. Led by Dr. Suraj Soman, scientist at the Centre for Sustainable Energy Technologies (C-SET), CSIR-NIIST, employed a novel dual-species copper electrolyte approach. DSCs, developed in the 1990s by Michael Gratzel at EPFL, Switzerland, mimic photosynthesis in plants. Their eco-friendly and affordable nature makes them the top choice among indoor photovoltaic technologies, the statement explained. The current advancement involves careful modification of the copper metal center's coordination environment, addressing recombination issues and enhancing performance, particularly in indoor conditions. The CSIR-NIIST team successfully demonstrated the technology by creating a self-powered temperature sensor that operated independently under indoor illumination, eliminating the need for batteries, it said. Dr. Narayanan Unni, Head of Centre for Sustainable Energy Technologies at NIIST, pointed out that powering electronic devices and realizing self-powered IoTs through indoor light harvesting would lead to a greener and more sustainable future, by reducing the number of throw-away primary batteries. CSIR-NIIST is presently engaged in translating this technology by developing innovative self-powered prototypes and products as well as exploring new applications to significantly reduce dependence on primary batteries, contributing to a reduced carbon footprint and thus addressing climate change, Anandharamakrishnan added.",

The companies could recover the investment by the sale of excess electricity after the consumption by the households. The companies will form subsidiaries to implement the rooftop project plan. Roof rent will help lower income houses to move to the rooftop solar projects,  a senior government official told ET.The move comes after the ministry of new and renewable energy raised the central financial assistance for the rooftop solar programme.  106848157 REC to be nodal agency For getting subsidy under existing regulations, residential consumers must install rooftop solar plants from one of the vendors registered by the distribution company of their locality.A wider choice and enhanced support could help bring more consumers, who already get subsidised electricity, into the ambit of rooftop solar, another official said.There will be designated companies for each state to implement the programme. A consumer could put in a request to join the programme by calling a phone number, a senior government official said.The move is expected to significantly increase the number of installations as cost is a major hurdle for the residential sector, especially in houses with 1-3 kW load. Currently, a rooftop project costs a minimum of Rs 50,000 per kW to set up. The cost per kW reduces as capacity goes higher. For the homes that have a connected load of 1 kW, the designated company may be allowed to install double the capacity for rooftop solar projects and recover the investment by the sale of surplus power.Other state-owned companies including DVC, Energy Efficiency Services, North Eastern Electric Power Corporation and THDC are also likely to invest in the segment. REC Ltd will be the nodal agency for the deployment of the programme.The government had launched rooftop solar programme Phase-II in March 2019 targeting 40 GW of rooftop solar capacity. It envisaged installation of 4,000 MW capacity in the residential sector by providing central financial assistance and incentives to distribution companies (discoms).The programme has not been able to garner the expected response so far from the residential segment consumers mainly because of the cost and the implementation process, apart from other procedural issues for the installations. Discoms being at the end of the electricity supply chain, play a crucial role in the implementation of the projects.High capital cost and limited awareness about the rooftop solar systems are leading barriers across states impacting consumers' willingness to buy, according to a report by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water in November. India has an installed rooftop solar capacity of 11 GW, of which only 2.7 GW is in the residential sector, as per the report.",

This $500 million in financing reflects the increasing strength of our partnership with India \u2013 DFC\u2019s largest market and a like-minded partner with a dynamic private sector.\u201dNathan travelled to India to cut the ribbon and formally inaugurate the new facility in Chennai.First Solar unveiled its new facility in Tamil Nadu which it said is the country\u2019s first fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing plant. The facility has an annual nameplate capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW) and directly employs approximately 1,000 people and will produce First Solar\u2019s Series 7 photovoltaic (PV) solar modules, which were developed at the company\u2019s research and development centers in the US and optimized for the Indian market.The company said it is unique among the world\u2019s largest solar manufacturers for being the only US-headquartered company. The company\u2019s tellurium-based semiconductor, which allows it to avoid dependence on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, is the second most common photovoltaic technology available today.\u201cWe are pleased that First Solar chose Tamil Nadu for this landmark investment, solidifying our state\u2019s position as India\u2019s hub for manufacturing,\u201d said Industries Minister TRB Rajaa. \u201cThis factory sets a high bar for sustainability and advanced manufacturing and has created high-value jobs as a result of its presence in our state, all while supporting India\u2019s ambition to become self-sufficient in solar technology. Special thanks to Mr. Mark Widmar and his team for having chosen Tamil Nadu as their destination.\u201dRepresenting an investment of approximately $700 million, which includes $500 million in previously announced DFC financing, the facility is First Solar\u2019s sixth operational factory and expands the company\u2019s global manufacturing footprint to four countries, including the US, Malaysia, and Vietnam.This is one of DFC\u2019s recent investments in solar supply chain diversification, which also include major financing for TP Solar\u2019s Tamil Nadu-based facility and a retainer letter signing with Vikram Solar to build an at-scale solar cell and module production facility in Tamil Nadu.U.S. Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said this First Solar production facility will help advance the global transition to cleaner, greener energy.  (It) stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when the United States and India work together \u2013 across government and private sectors \u2013 to achieve lasting climate action,\u201d he said.U.S. Consul General in Chennai Christopher Hodges and First Solar Chief Commercial Officer Georges Antoun were also present at the event.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: US-based First Solar said it has invested USD 700 million in setting up India's first integrated solar manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu that was inaugurated on Thursday. The facility, which has an annual capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW), is located in Tamil Nadu.  It will produce the 'company's series 7' Photovoltaic (PV) solar modules for the Indian market. The facility has provided a direct employment opportunity to around 1,000 people, according to a statement.  Tamil Nadu's Minister for Industries, Promotions and Commerce TRB Rajaa was the chief guest at the plant's inaugural ceremony that was also attended by the United States Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti and Chief Executive Officer of the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) Scott Nathan.  The factory sets a high bar for sustainability and advanced manufacturing and has created high-value jobs in the state. It will support India's ambition to become self-sufficient in solar technology, Rajaa said.  Garcetti said the production facility will help advance the global transition to cleaner, greener energy and stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when the United States and India work together across the government and private sectors to achieve lasting climate action.   Representing an investment of approximately USD 700 million, the facility is First Solar's sixth operational factory and expands the company's global manufacturing footprint to four countries, including the US, Malaysia, and Vietnam,  the statement said. Series 7 modules use 50 per cent less energy and only a third of water than polysilicon modules that are produced in China.",

        "articleBody": "The government has increased benchmark central financial assistance for the residential sector under the rooftop solar program to give a push to the projects and cover the higher cost of solar panels.Support for up to 3 kW capacity has been raised to Rs 18,000 per kW for general states, up 23.4%, from Rs 14,588 per kW earlier, according to a notification from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.For over 3kW and up to 10 kW capacity, the assistance has been raised to Rs 9,000 per kW for general states from Rs 7,294 per kW.The last revision in the benchmark for central financial assistance for rooftop projects was done about a year ago.The new rates will apply to all future bids that will be closed after January 20 and claims submitted after January 5.According to a report by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) in November, over 25 crore households across India have the potential to deploy 637 GW of solar energy capacity on rooftops.With the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy\u2019s capital subsidy, the potential increases to 32 GW making the solar systems feasible for more consumers, the report had said. Currently, India has installed 11 GW of rooftop solar capacity, of which only 2.7 GW is in the residential sector, as per the report.Rooftop solar projects also got a boost recently with the introduction of the \u2018distributed renewable energy\u2019 segment in the latest renewable purchase obligations (RPO) issued in October.According to the changes in the RPO, the power distribution companies have to mandatorily purchase renewable energy from rooftop solar projects.To achieve a 40-GW rooftop solar target by 2022, the central government had launched two phases of the grid-connected rooftop and small solar power plants programme with incentives through central financial assistance.Discoms have been apprehensive of signing power purchase agreements for rooftop solar projects and installing the required net metering systems fearing loss of revenue from their high-paying consumers, financial viability of such projects and problems in sourcing finance, according to industry experts.106646410",

        "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Vedanta Group entity Serentica Renewables, a commercial and industrial (C&I) focused renewable energy developer in India, has raised a ?3,500 crore ($425 million) foreign currency loan for its round-the-clock renewable energy project in India.A consortium of three international banks (Rabobank, MUFG Bank, Societe Generale) and three Indian lenders (YES Bank, Export-Import Bank of India, India Infrastructure Finance Company) have structured the loan for Serentica. Rabobank acted as the sole structuring bank for this loan facility. Tenure of the ECB facility is seven years, and the interest rate is 6.25%.This deal will help Serentica in funding the development of its 530 MW hybrid (wind and solar) renewable energy projects coming up in Rajasthan and Maharashtra. This is the first ever dollar loan for a C&I project in India. For high-quality platforms pursuing decarbonization, there is a good amount of depth in the local and foreign banks for debt and a good amount of depth in the equity markets for equity,  said Pratik Agarwal, chairman, Serentica Renewables.He said India is a ?3-4 lakh crore electricity consumption market just in the C&I segment that is badly served.  There are deeply dissatisfied customers there. If you can offer them a high-quality round-the-clock green product at the right price, we believe there's a huge opportunity, so we're focused on that. This project will provide clean energy to one of India's largest zinc producers, Hindustan Zinc, replacing 24% of their coal-based power supply with firm dispatchable green power while significantly reducing the carbon footprint.This capital infusion comes close on the heels of the total debt raise of ?5,600 crore- ?3,000 crore from REC Ltd and ?2,600 from Power Finance Corporation- to fund its hybrid renewable energy projects coming up in Karnataka where it is setting up 560 MW of wind and solar capacities.",

Under the project of the Ministry of Development of Northeast Region (DoNER), the micro grids will be established in hamlets in Dhalai, Unakoti, and South, West and North Tripura districts, where  conventional electricity appears non profitable  to the state power utility because of low population density, he said.  The DoNER has sanctioned Rs 81 crore to Tripura for setting up 274 solar micro grids in remote areas, particularly tribal hamlets, where conventional electricity has not reached the people yet. A total of 9,250 families will be benefited under the project,  an official of the Tripura Renewable Energy Development Agency (TREDA) said. The northeastern state still has several tribal and non-tribal habitations where electricity has not reached yet due to geographical isolation and low population density, he said, adding the project will light up the houses by using solar power.  Each solar micro grid will have an installed capacity ranging from 2 KW to 25 KW depending on the population of a particular habitation. Although the tariff has not been finalised yet, the beneficiary needs to pay a small amount for power consumption,  he said, adding the work is expected to commence in the current fiscal. According to TREDA estimation, the northeastern state has a solar power potential of 2,000 MW, of which only 19.50 MW is being generated at present. Recently, the state has unveiled Tripura Energy Vision of generating 500 MW of solar power by 2030.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Electricity provider BSES has energised 6,000 rooftop solar installations so far and the discom plans to energise over 1,000 more connections in the 2024-25 financial year, officials said on Friday. The highest number of rooftop solar connections are in the domestic segment (3,650), followed by commercial (1,087), educational (939), industrial (85) and others (129), they said.  The response to roof top solar net metering has been very incredibly encouraging in the BSES area. Consumers across categories, including residential, educational (and schools) and commercial establishments have warmed up to roof top solar net metering in big-way,  a BSES statement said. The highest energised load is in the commercial segment with 57 Megawatt peak (MWp), followed by the educational segment with 45 MWp, industrial with 6 MWp and others with 11 MWp. BSES officials further said that more than 100 residential societies have opted for rooftop solar connections, helping consumers save over Rs 110 crore annually.  BSES has energised 'roof-top net metering' connections ranging from a sanctioned load of 1 KW to over 4,000 KW. Consumers have begun to see the benefits of roof top solar net metering and how it reduces their electricity bills,  the statement said. Rooftop solar net metering is an ideal method to reduce electricity bills and contribute to the betterment of the environment. Every KW of rooftop solar generates about 100 to 120 units of electricity every month and the cost of the system can be recovered in around four years. A typical 10 KW of rooftop solar connection with a monthly consumption of 1,200 units every month can save around Rs 82,000 annually, the officials said.  Besides helping BSES in meeting its renewable purchase obligation (RPO), the pioneering initiative will help the discom minimise overloading issues in congested areas, especially during the peak summer months,  the BSES said. On the other hand, Tata Power-DDL energised 2,412 rooftop solar connections and the solar load touches 63.3 MWp, helping consumers save approximately Rs 45-50 crore annually.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Sustainable Energy Infra Trust, a renewable energy infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) backed by Mahindra group, is raising Rs 2,500 crore in a round led by Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) with participation from domestic institutional investors (DIIs), people aware of the development said. ET had first reported on August 22 that AIIB, Dutch pension fund APG Asset Management, and World Bank arm International Finance Corp were in separate talks to invest capital in the Mahindra Susten and Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP)-sponsored InvIT. Sustainable Energy Infra will house 1.54 gigawatts (GW) of solar assets. 106359132 AIIB is coming in as the anchor investor and will lead this round with a close to $80-million cheque (approximately Rs 665 crore),  one of the people cited above said.  In addition, several domestic institutional investors are investing around $60-70 million (Rs 500-600 crore). A formal closure of the deal and announcement is expected in early January.  Rest of the capital will come from Mahindra Susten and OTPP as sponsor commitment, the person said.  This is just the first tranche of investment from AIIB and it is most likely to invest more in the InvIT in the future as more assets are dropped into it by the sponsors,  the source said.  AIIB is also keen on investing in debt instruments that the InvIT plans to issue to refinance debt at the level of the operating assets.  Emails sent to AIIB and OTPP did not elicit a response. Mahindra group declined to comment. The funds raised will be used to refinance the existing debt of the solar projects that are being housed under the InvIT, including repayment of loans provided by Mahindra Susten.Total debt of the InvIT portfolio stood at Rs 4,797.7 crore as of August 31, as per a draft placement memorandum filed with markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Apart from the equity funding, the InvIT will also raise debt, which will also be used to repay existing loans.Mahindra Susten's businesses include the conglomerate's renewable-focused engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) unit (with more than 4 GW of capacity constructed) as well as an independent power production (IPP) unit with around 1.54 GW of operational solar plants. The entire 1.54 GW are being transferred to the InvIT.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India\u2019s solar panel imports are set to remain higher in financial year 2023-24 (FY24) as compared to FY23 owing to upcoming solar power capacities planned till FY26 and how the situation around ALMM evolves, according to industry experts.During the initial six months of FY24, India saw a surge in solar module imports, reaching a substantial $1,136.28 million. This surpassed the total PV panel imports for the entire FY23, which amounted to $943.53 million, according to Eninrac Consulting. Vikram V, vice-president, co-group head - corporate ratings, ICRA, said the reason behind this is two-fold. The government has put restrictions on usage of directly imported modules for projects under the approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) where the modules had to be procured from domestic players. \u201cFrom March 2023, the Order has been put on abeyance till March 2024 wherein the developers can import the modules directly. The other reason is the sharp reduction in solar module and cell prices has led to the sharp rise in imports in the current financial year,\u201d said Vikram.He added that this year the imports will remain higher in FY24 as compared to FY23.\u201cWhat happens to solar imports after March 2024 depends on how the situation around ALMM evolves\u2026 But even then imports will be there but they will be restricted to solar cells while modules will have to be procured domestically,\u201d said.The estimated solar module imports in India for FY23 was 2.6 GW and for FY24 till October 24 was 8.9 GW, according to the research consultancy. It added that the estimated MW imports were drawn by assuming an average price per MW of solar panels. According to Ravi Shekhar, director, Eninrac Consulting, although domestic manufacturing is ramping up in India, it is still far from serving the annual demand generated for panels in the country which in turn necessitates imports. \u201cThe extent of imports is likely to follow a similar trend as displayed in the past 18 months owing to the upcoming solar capacities planned till FY26, quantifying a volume of 18.9 GW. This means nearly 9.5 GW on an annual basis shall be required in the coming two financial years \u2013 unless otherwise fresh capacities are announced in the near future \u2013 signaling close to 75 per cent to 80 per cent of capacity added in FY23,\u201d said Shekhar.He, however, added that the overall volume of imports might decline, though imports at large will serve the Indian demand with a transition likely to be recorded from China to other countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Hong Kong in the mix as well. China maintained its position as the primary contributor to the Indian market, supplying solar panels valued at $501.9 million in H1 FY24, in contrast to $874.89 million during the 12 months of FY23, according to Eninrac Consulting. It added that following China, Vietnam and Hong Kong emerged as significant suppliers, delivering modules worth $455.8 million and $121.82 million in the first half of FY24, a considerable increase from $39.63 million and $3.04 million in FY23, respectively. H1 FY24 saw imports from Malaysia totaling $43.08 million.Shifting focus to PV cells, not assembled in modules or panels, India\u2019s imports in H1 FY24 amounted to $1,005.07 million, a decline from $1,310.28 million in the 12 months of FY23. China remained the principal supplier, contributing shipments valued at $499.98 million, followed by Malaysia at $264.19 million, and Thailand at $138.07 million, noted the consultancy.",

        "articleBody": "India's top solar panel maker Waaree Energies on Thursday said it would invest up to $1 billion to build a factory in Texas to take advantage of soaring U.S. demand for clean energy. The announcement is the latest major corporate commitment to solar manufacturing since passage of U.S. President Joe Biden's landmark climate change law last year which offers subsidies and tax breaks for clean energy projects. India's solar manufacturing industry is growing rapidly and just beginning to use its know-how in the United States, with both countries looking to build a clean energy sector to compete with China.  Waaree said that by 2027 its planned Brookshire, Texas facility will be one of the largest solar factories in the U.S., with an annual capacity of 3 gigawatts (GW) of panels when it opens in late 2024, then expanding to 5 GW. The Houston-area factory will create more than 1,500 jobs, it said. The company aims to add a solar cell facility by 2025. Waaree's plans are supported by a long-term supply agreement with SB Energy, a clean energy developer backed by Japan's Softbank Group.  By setting up the new facility in the Houston area, Waaree brings critical technologies that will boost American solar production, reducing reliance on overseas sources while supporting strong U.S. jobs,  Sunil Rathi, interim CEO of Waaree Solar Americas said in a statement.  We are committed to the U.S. and its growing demand for clean energy.  Under Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, solar project developers receive additional subsidies for using American-made equipment, and producers also receive new incentives. Most major components in Waaree's solar modules will be made in the U.S., the company said. Waaree's move to manufacture in the U.S. comes after a venture backed by India's Vikram Solar earlier this year said it would invest $1.5 billion in the U.S. solar supply chain.  Waaree has made inroads into the U.S. market already this year by supplying 4 GW of solar modules from its factory in India.",

        "articleBody": "Indian imports of solar power equipment have risen rapidly this year, and the country is still highly reliant on foreign suppliers despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s efforts to increase self-sufficiency, according to BloombergNEF.Solar panel imports hit an 18-month high in September, while purchases of photovoltaic cells in value terms in the first nine months of this year were higher than for the whole three years through 2022, BNEF said in a report released Friday. The country is particularly dependent on its geopolitical rival China, which has produced 57% to 100% of Indian imports of products including modules, cells, wafers and solar glass since the start of 2021, it said.Also Read: Next Adani milestone is plan for $1.25 billion of green arm debtIndia\u2019s predicament highlights the dominant role of China in many energy transition technologies. New Delhi\u2019s move to try and become more self-reliant in solar technology and also build an export industry dates back to 2020, when the pandemic disrupted supply chains. Increasing tensions with Beijing possibly played a part as well. Since then, India has used a mix of trade barriers, domestic content requirements and subsidies to incentivize local manufacturing.Also Read: RIL turns to sugar mills to fuel green energy plansThe country is targeting a rapid increase in the proportion of solar in its coal-dominated electricity mix, from around 17% of capacity now to almost 39% by 2032. In terms of solar module manufacturing, it\u2019s aiming to lift capacity to 100 gigawatts a year by the end of 2026, about five times the current level shown in the government\u2019s latest approved list.

Around two-thirds of India\u2019s consumption of cells and 100% of wafers came from imports since the start of 2021, and this is unlikely to fall in 2024, it said. Some Indian manufacturers are concerned about Beijing potentially restricting the export of machinery to make wafers, cells and modules, according to BNEF.India currently doesn\u2019t produce any wafers or polysilicon.

        "articleBody": "India will add another 38 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity by March 2025 to touch 170 GW-mark, aided by moderation in solar module prices, an Icra analyst said on Thursday. The country's installed renewable energy capacity was at 130 GW as of October 2023, Vikram V, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, Icra, said in a webinar.  Indian Renewable Energy (RE) capacity is expected to reach 170 GW by March 2025, led by strong policy support and moderation in solar module prices, he said.  The capacity addition thereafter is likely to be supported by the significant improvement in tendering activity in the current fiscal with over 16 GW projects bid out so far and another 17 GW bids underway by the central nodal agencies, Vikram said.  The share of RE-based round-the-clock (RTC) projects is expected to rise in upcoming tenders to mitigate the intermittency risk associated with renewables.  This is in line with the 50 GW annual bidding trajectory announced by the government of India in March 2023.  He further said that the sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices by 65 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, over the past 12 months is leading to a healthy improvement in debt coverage metrics for the upcoming solar power projects.  While this is positive in the near term, the developers would remain exposed to movement in imported solar PV cell and wafer prices, till the development of fully integrated module manufacturing units in India.  The rise in the renewable energy capacity over the next six years is estimated to increase the share of RE plus large hydro in the all-India electricity generation from 23 per cent in FY23 to around 40 per cent in FY30.  Given the intermittency associated with RE generation, the availability of RTC supply from RE sources remains important. This can be made possible through the use of wind and solar power projects complemented with energy storage systems.  The state distribution utilities (discoms) have also shown an improved discipline in making payments to power generators, including RE IPPs (Independent Power Producers), following the implementation of the late payment surcharge (LPS) rules in June 2022.  Discoms in most key states have been clearing dues within three months from the billing date to RE IPPs for the past 15 months. Moreover, the past dues are being cleared through installments under the LPS scheme.",

        "articleBody": "Solar power generation capacity can go up to 75,000 gigawatts by 2050 globally with long-duration storage capacity, a report by the International Solar Association (ISA) and LDES Council, said. The report released on Tuesday by ISA and the Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) Council unveils a bold vision for the future of renewable energy, showcasing the pivotal role of Long Duration Energy Storage in realizing ambitious solar targets.  The report, presented at COP28 in Dubai, emphasized the transformative potential of combining solar energy with LDES to ensure continuous, reliable, and affordable renewable energy, a statement said.  The report emphasized the necessity of LDES to fully realize the potential of solar installations for complete decarbonization and achieving a solar capacity of 75,000 GW by 2050.  It presented a case study of isolated island utilities in the US, demonstrating the financial viability of LDES in areas with limited interconnectivity and high local fuel costs.  The combination of solar, wind, and LDES emerges as the most cost-effective solution for achieving 100 per cent renewable energy.  The LDES Council estimates that LDES will become a USD 4 trillion industry by 2040, with an installed capacity potential of 8 TW, the statement said.  This growth is essential for enabling solar energy to meet global electricity demands affordably and reliably.  The report also identified barriers to the widespread adoption of solar and LDES, including regulatory challenges, financing issues, and technical limitations, and proposed solutions to overcome these hurdles.   Solar, already the most economical source of new electricity globally, will further strengthen its competitive advantage. Combined with Long Duration Energy Storage, solar becomes a continuous, reliable 24/7 energy source,  stated Dr. Ajay Mathur, Director General ISA.   Developing long-duration energy storage is the best pathway to full decarbonization for economies worldwide. LDES provides the scaffolding for reliable, resilient, around-the-clock renewable energy for industry and the electric grid,  asserted Julia Souder, Chief Executive Office, LDES Council.",

        "articleBody": "The Supreme Court on Friday sought response from the Centre on the Acme Solar Holdings\u2019 petition seeking ratification of its 400 kV overhead transmission line with bird divertors and commissioning of its Rs 7000-crore 1200 MW solar power projects, which it had won through tariff-based competitive bidding in 2018.A Bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud issued notice to the ministries of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and Power (MoP), Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and others on a petition by Acme Solar challenging the SC-appointed committee\u2019s decision that held that the laying of underground 400 kV transmission line by the solar power company in Rajasthan was not feasible.While laying of overhead transmission lines through the habitat of the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB) had alarmed environmentalists, the solar power developer argued that the projects and the overhead transmission line had already been conceptualised and were under construction much before passing of the apex court's order in 2021.By not ratifying Acme\u2019s request for overhead transmission line despite holding it as technically challenging to underground, the committee has not only acted contrary to the SC\u2019s April 19, 2021 order but has also restricted/stopped the generation and transmission of 1200 MW renewable power from its projects, senior counsel AM Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi argued. This is contrary to the balanced approach of sustainable development adopted by the SC, they added.The committee in May and July had concluded that undergrounding of the 400 kV transmission line of Acme Solar was not feasible and had decided not to ratify the company\u2019s request for overhead lines since the line was under the Prioritized GIB area. As a result, SECI had refused to allow charging and commissioning of the company\u2019s 400 kV overhead transmission line with bird divertors and the 4x300 MW solar projects.According to Acme, the Prioritized GIB area does not find mention in the SC 2021 order and its projects and the transmission line fall in the potential area. The committee had approved all overhead lines in the potential area, irrespective of the voltage level, it added. Acme Solar Holding, a solar power developer, was awarded 1200 MW solar power projects by SECI in accordance with the tariff-based competitive bidding held in 2018. Thereafter, Acme Solar secured approvals for construction of overhead transmission lines for evacuation of power from its projects. Pursuant to the awarding of the contract, Acme had awarded engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for supply and services in August 2020 for Rs 5454.6 crore and began construction of the Project infrastructure.However, the SC in April 2021 had demarcated priority and potential habitat areas of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB), and held that undergrounding of transmission lines might not be feasible in certain areas and, therefore, bird diverters would be installed for such lines.The SC had also directed that overhead transmission lines in the Priority and Potential GIB habitat areas be laid underground, subject to feasibility, undergrounding of high voltage transmission lines requires technical evaluation on a case-to-case basis. For this, the apex court had formed a committee to assess the technical feasibility.",

The SPV is formed under the Government's Group Captive Open Access Renewable Energy Scheme.The project is aligned with the Indian Government's commitment in COP26 to reach 500 GW of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030; and will leverage group captive models for renewable energy procurement.Rohit Jawa, HUL CEO and MD, said, \u201cCollaboration is key to achieving our net zero commitment. The proposed green energy partnership is a step in the right direction. I am sure this will pave the way for more such transformative partnerships that align with environmental and economic sustainability and will help stakeholders across the value chain.\u201dHUL said it is well placed to deliver on Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction in line with the commitment to zero emissions in its operations by 2030. HUL is also committed to net zero emissions for all its products, from sourcing to the point of sale, by 2039. This initiative will help to address the challenge of non-green energy consumption in HUL\u2019s own and collaborative manufacturing units. It can also be expanded to strategic suppliers in the next phase.Nawal Saini, Managing Director, Renewable Power & Transition, Brookfield, added, \u201cWe are excited to form this unique partnership wherein we will be supplying green energy at scale to HUL and its suppliers from a single location in Bikaner which is a part of our larger 550 MW solar park. This park is dedicated to accelerating the decarbonization goals of both government and businesses in India.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "BluPine Energy, a unit of London-based private equity firm Actis, has bought solar power assets from Acme group for an enterprise value of \u20b91,700 crore, said people familiar with the matter. The acquired assets are housed in 14 special purpose vehicles. Binding agreements have been signed. The deal is subject to certain closing conditions,  said one of the persons cited above.The acquisition will add 312 megawatts of solar capacity to BluPine Energy, which was incorporated in 2021, the people said.Actis and Acme Solar did not comment for this story.BluPine has rapidly expanded capacities through acquisitions and currently has a renewable capacity of 1.8 gigawatts.In November last year, the company announced the acquisition of solar projects of 400 megawatts capacity from Atha Group.Actis, which has $12.73 billion in assets under management, had previously announced plans to invest $800 million (\u20b96,666 crore) in BluPine Energy and ramp up the capacity to 4 gigawatts eventually. A substantial part of this growth could come from acquisitions, said people aware of the matter.On its part, Actis had successfully built and divested two renewable energy companies in India, namely, Ostro Energy and Sprng Energy. It sold Ostro Energy to ReNew Power in 2018 for $1.63 billion, and subsequently sold Sprng Energy to Shell for $1.55 billion last year.Gurugram-based Acme group, founded by Manoj Upadhyay, has a large portfolio of solar projects with almost 10 gigawatts under construction and 1.5 gigawatts of operational solar power projects, according to its website. Acme like other renewable energy companies keeps divesting assets periodically. This helps to generate funds for re-investment in new projects,  said a person aware of the company's thinking.Actis, through its arm Actis Long Life Infrastructure Fund, had purchased 400 megawatts of solar assets from Acme in 2020 as well.While overall merger and acquisition activity has remained slow this year compared to previous years, there was one large deal in the renewable energy sector with Malaysia's Petronas agreeing to invest $1.6 billion in Greenko group's new green ammonia venture. That ranked amongst the top five capital raises in the current year across sectors.The government has announced a target to build almost 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Indian conglomerates such as Tata, Adani, JSW and Birla have all entered the renewable energy generation businesses.",

Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited (TPREL), has received a Letter of Award (LOA) for developing the 200 MW FDRE project with SJVN Ltd (SJVN),  the company said.  The financial details of the order haven't been disclosed yet. SJVN is a public sector undertaking (PSU) involved in hydroelectric and renewable power generation and transmission and has been designated as the Renewable Energy Implementing Agency (REIA) by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) for achieving the nation's target of achieving 500 GW by 2030.  This is the first FDRE power tender won by TPREL. The tender includes a Greenshoe option, allowing for additional capacity beyond the initial 200 MW. The project has a hybrid combination of solar, wind, and battery storage of appropriate capacities.  The project is expected to be commissioned within 24 months from the power purchase agreement (PPA) execution date. The project was awarded through competitive bidding, followed by a reverse e-auction.  The installation will offset 9 lakh metric tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.  With this win, the total renewables capacity of TPREL reaches 8,314 MW, which comprises 4,100 MW of projects in different phases of development and with an operating capacity of 4,214 MW, including 3,200 MW in solar projects and 1,014 MW in wind projects.",

It added that SWREL liability will be met through fund infusion from SPCPL\u2019s promoters.\u201cGiven the weak operating cash flows, SPCPL is expected to meet this obligation by liquidating its stake in SWREL,\u201d ICRA said on November 20.However, in an email response to ET, SP Group said \u201cThe information is inaccurate. Shapoorji Pallonji Group is not selling its stake to meet its indemnity obligations.\u201dState Bank of India, IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, RBL Bank, DBS Bank India, HSBC, Exim Bank, IDFC, Exim Bank, and IndusInd Bank has provided funding to SWREL, according to a disclosure by IndiaRatings date September 4.",

Mercom India noted a 34% YoY decrease in installations for July-September, with 1.9 GW compared to the previous 2.8 GW. However, on a QoQ basis, installations increased by nearly 6%. Challenges included extensions to solar projects, oversupply of modules in China affecting prices, and uncertainties in transmission connectivity procedures. ",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, India has reported a 47 per cent fall in solar installations at 5.6 GW during January-September 2023, amid delay in project execution, according to research firm Mercom India. The installations were also down in the July-September quarter this year at 1.9 GW, a 34 per cent fall, over 2.8 GW solar capacity installed in the same period a year ago, the research firm said.  However, on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, the installations increased almost 6 per cent compared to 1.8 GW in Q2 2023.   During the first nine months of 2023, 5.6 GW of solar was installed in India. Solar capacity additions fell nearly 47 per cent compared to 10.5 GW installed in 9M 2022,  Mercom India Solar Market Update report said.  The utility-scale installations dropped more than 54 per cent year-over-year (YoY) to 4.2 GW.   Barring significant negative developments, installations in 2024 should grow exponentially. Declining prices (of ped products) are now the cause of slower growth (compared to rising prices earlier) as developers and installers push procurement to the last minute. Hopefully, the market can handle the expected rush in Q1 2024 and thrive,  Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group said.  The extensions granted to several large-scale solar and hybrid power projects and those facing delays due to land and transmission issues primarily affected installations in January-September 2023.  The oversupply of modules in China further lowered the average selling prices of solar modules, which have fallen consecutively over the last four quarters.  The challenges in securing transmission connectivity increased further with the change in project timelines. During Q3, the project developers also lacked clarity on application procedures under the amended regulations for long-term access to transmission networks.  However, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) issued clarifications towards the quarter's end, which is expected to ease the process over the next few quarters. Several projects stuck in the habitat of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) are still waiting for the Supreme Court order to receive transmission connectivity.  India's cumulative installed solar capacity, including total rooftop solar installations, surpassed 69 GW as of September 2023.  The country's utility-scale solar development pipeline stood at nearly 77 GW as of September 2023, and over 68 GW of projects tendered were pending auction at the end of Q3 2023.  Rajasthan remained the leading state for cumulative large-scale solar installations, adding nearly 17 GW at the end of Q3 2023, accounting for over 28 per cent. Karnataka and Gujarat came in next with almost 16 per cent and 11 per cent share, respectively.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Infrastructure investors Actis and Edelweiss and Malaysian state oil company Petronas are in talks to acquire a portfolio of 185 megawatts (MW) of solar assets in India owned by Finnish utility Fortum and co-investors for an enterprise value of at least $150 million, two people aware of the development told ET.ET first reported on April 25 that Kotak Mahindra Capital had been appointed to find buyers for the solar portfolio. The prospective buyers are currently conducting due diligence on the solar assets and final bids are expected soon. These are good quality assets and have generated strong investor interest,  said one of the persons cited above. The transaction is likely to value the portfolio at an enterprise valuation of over $150 million. This will be a complete sale and the two co-investors along with Fortum will exit the portfolio completely,  the person added.The operational assets are jointly owned by Fortum, Macquarie Group-backed UK Climate Investments and Finnish asset management firm Elite Alfred Berg. Fortum is the largest shareholder with a 46% stake, UK Climate Investments owns 40% and Elite Alfred Berg has a 14% stake. UK Climate Investments and Elite Alfred Berg acquired their stakes from Fortum in 2018.The portfolio comprises a 100 MW solar project at the Pavagada Solar Park in Karnataka, two projects of 70 MW and 5 MW each in Rajasthan and another 10 MW facility in Madhya Pradesh.Fortum has 25-year power purchase agreements with both state-owned NTPC Ltd and Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) for the solar projects.105395451Fortum started its solar power business in India in 2013 with the acquisition of a 5 MW power plant. It set up the 10 MW greenfield facility in 2015. The other capacities of 70 MW and 100 MW were commissioned in 2017.In June 2021, it sold its other assets - a 250 MW solar power plant in Karnataka and another 250 MW in Rajasthan, to Actis for 280 million euros.Fortum is currently building two solar projects with a total capacity of 600 MW in Karnataka and a 200 MW solar project in Gujarat.Fortum, Actis, Edelweiss and UK Climate declined to comment. An email query sent to Petronas did not elicit a response till press time.Actis, Edelweiss and Petronas are among the most active investors in the Indian green energy space.In an interaction with ET, Actis chairman Torbjorn Caesar said that the firm plans to invest up to $2.5 billion in the Indian energy and infrastructure space over the next four years, with renewables comprising the bulk of its investment plans. Actis has built and sold two large renewable companies in India - Ostro Energy and Sprng Energy.ET reported on 17 October that Petronas and two other bidders had evinced interest in acquiring a majority stake in TPG-backed Fourth Partner Energy, a company which supplies green energy to commercial and industrial establishments. In 2019, Petronas acquired Amplus Energy for \u20b92,700 crore, a rooftop solar power producer.In 2021, Edelweiss acquired a 74% stake in an 813 MW renewable portfolio owned by French energy major Engie.",

This comes at a time when China is predicted to hold more than 80% of the global capacity for the solar module supply chain from 2024.The report indicates that even as India plans to boost its module exports to the profitable US market, it grapples with high production costs due to a 25% basic customs duty on imported solar cells. There is speculation that to support the export ambitions, the Indian government might lower the duty on Chinese modules, which currently incur a 40% tax.In contrast, the US, under the Inflation Reduction Act, is developing its own photovoltaic manufacturing capabilities. However, the absence of domestic production of wafers, cells, or glass means the US will remain dependent on imports, especially once President Biden's temporary waiver on solar import tariffs expires in mid-2024.Meanwhile, Southeast Asia's solar capacity, mainly driven by Chinese investments, and Europe's demand for protective tariffs on Chinese modules due to non-competitive prices, underscore the global shifts in the solar module supply chain.The study further delves into China's lead in N-type cell technology and the anticipated impact on the market, with China accounting for 95% of the announced global expansions in this area.The tightening of profit margins in the sector is causing challenges, yet the report suggests that vertically integrated manufacturers may still find opportunities for growth.",

        "articleBody": "Over 25 crore households across India have the potential to deploy 637 GW of solar energy capacity on rooftops, according to a new independent report by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) released on Thursday. The CEEW report said that deploying just one-third of this total solar technical potential could support the entire electricity demand of India's residential sector (about 310 TWh).  However, the technical potential reduces to one-fifth (118 GW) after factoring in the current electricity consumption of households.   Most residential consumers fall into low-consumption slabs and solar may not be economically feasible for them without financial support even though it is technically possible.  The potential reduces further to 11 GW when no capital subsidy is considered, the payback period for rooftop solar is restricted to five years and we factor in consumers' willingness to buy rooftop solar,  the report said.  Currently, India has installed 11 GW of rooftop solar capacity, of which only 2.7 GW is in the residential sector.  The CEEW report did a bottom-up analysis across 21 Indian states that cover 97 per cent of the country's population.  It found that 60 per cent of the residential rooftop potential was concentrated in just seven states - Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.  India's rooftop solar potential is spread geographically across states in contrast to other renewable technologies like utility-scale solar and wind projects, and could be critical to the energy transition ambitions of states.  Moreover, rural areas show higher technical potential based on residential rooftop area (363 GW) compared to urban areas across states (274 GW).  Arunabha Ghosh, the CEO of CEEW, said that India's solar energy revolution - going from 2,000 MW of solar power capacity in 2010 to 72,018 MW now - must reach households too to achieve its full potential.   CEEW's study shows the mammoth capacity of solar systems that both rural and urban households can deploy to guarantee not only a transition to clean energy but also fulfil a basic need - access to power.  But to get there, residents must get the right price and attractive incentives and enjoy a convenient experience, which can then spur the markets to create the right products and capacities for homes,  he said.  The CEEW report also found that residential awareness of rooftop solar systems was less than 50 per cent at the national level in FY 2020.  Awareness in most states was clustered between 30 and 50 per cent. When it came to willingness to install rooftop solar systems, residential consumers in Gujarat showed the highest willingness at 13 per cent, compared to the national average of 5 per cent.  However, residents across states perceive rooftop solar systems to be costly investments, impacting their willingness to pay.  According to another CEEW study released on Thursday, solarising residential households also offers huge economic benefits to power distribution companies (discoms).  The study on solarising rural households in Bihar and Meghalaya highlights lifetime economic gains to the tune of Rs 2,700 crore per 100 MW of solar capacity to discoms. The benefits will be due to reduced cross-subsidy burden, improved transmission and distribution losses, and lower average cost to serve consumers.  The CEEW study recommended introducing targeted capital subsidies for consumers, particularly for rooftop solar system sizes of 0-3 kW, and recognising systems below 1 kW in policies and regulations.  Further, for consumers, states should create a one-stop platform for rooftop solar to provide basic, reliable, and compelling information about rooftop solar. At the national level, there is a need to roll out awareness campaigns to generate demand.",

        "articleBody": "Indian solar panel manufacturers are grappling with the influx of cheaper Chinese imports funnelled through intermediary countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore as Chinese companies exploit Free Trade Agreement (FTA) loopholes to export to India. Despite New Delhi's imposition of a 40% customs duty on solar modules and 25% on solar cells in April 2022 to boost domestic production and reduce Chinese imports, companies in China are finding ways to bypass these high tariffs and continue supplies to Indian solar farm developers.The Chinese companies have effectively utilised this strategy in the past to evade local tariffs, as demonstrated by a year-long investigation in August 2023 by US federal authorities, which revealed that five Chinese solar panel firms had circumvented tariff regulations by channelling their operations through countries such as Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.Following the imposition of tariffs, direct Chinese exports to India have declined, but from April to August 2023, imports of solar panel modules from Vietnam and Malaysia have surged, accounting for 60% of all such imports into India, with the majority of these products originating from Chinese companies. Indian manufacturers say the imports are hurting domestic industry as the Chinese firms are resorting to dumping their products by misusing the FTA route.\u201cFrom July to September, roughly 41% of solar panels were procured from non-Chinese sources located in Vietnam, Malaysia, and other regions. This year has witnessed a significant increase of 50-60% in the import of solar panels from outside India. It is widely acknowledged that these companies have Chinese ultimate ownership and are engaging in product dumping in the Indian market,  said Gyanesh Chaudhary, founder, vice chairman, and managing director of Vikram Solar.An executive at another top Indian manufacturer of solar panels told ET on condition of anonymity that this trend of China (direct exports) plus China (Chinese product exports routed through FTA countries) is a tested practice that Chinese firms with large capacities employ globally.\u201cIndia is losing hundreds of millions of dollars to China due to this bypassing. Countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, etc. are very well connected, so product labels get changed quickly, but everything is produced in China. After India levied a tariff on direct imports, the Chinese even charged a slight premium to sell to Indian buyers through this route,\u201d the executive said. \u201cI recently travelled to Laos and was shocked to see the large industrial complexes that Chinese companies had built in that country. How do we compete against that kind of capacity without government help?\u201dIndustry experts say that while government initiatives like the implementation of the basis customs duty for solar panels, the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and the PLI have helped the domestic industry, loopholes in the schemes have allowed project developers and global manufacturers to import solar modules. \u201cThe question to be asked from the Indian government is: What is the intention behind building solar farms with Chinese supply chains? The attempt should be to make India truly Atmanirbhar with made-in-India products. Globally, climate change and solar renewables have been such an important agenda when the energy mix is shifting towards renewables. So, does it make sense to hand it over completely to the Chinese rather than help build an Indian ecosystem?  said Chaudhary at Vikram Solar.However, Indian solar farm developers say that domestic solar panel manufacturers don\u2019t have sufficient capacity to meet the demand, and there are also quality issues with their products. The domestic manufacturers, on their part, say that Indian developers tend to delay procurement decisions to get the best prices, which doesn\u2019t allow them to plan their supply chain schedules, while Chinese firms have large capacities and financial muscle. \u201cSupply chains in solar take time to build, and we have to import certain key parts that still aren\u2019t made in India. It takes time. The Chinese companies have government backing and funding, plus they are far ahead of us in terms of capacity, so they can afford to have large inventories and even play the discounting game to kill competition,\u201d said another solar panel manufacturer on condition of anonymity.The Indian companies have been in talks with the government at various levels and are hopeful of a resolution soon, according to the top executives at these companies, who are hoping that the government would implement the ALMM soon to effectively curb rising imports from FTA countries. The manufacturers say that if the solar farm developers and the government help, they can fulfil the domestic demand. \u201cThe domestic capacity was double the deployment, so why do Indian developers want to import? And most leading Indian manufacturers export to the US and other developed countries, so quality is not an issue either,\u201d said the manufacturer cited above.Currently, there are more than 100 solar panel manufacturers in India. A report by rating agency Icra forecast India's solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing capacity to cross 60 GW by 2025, a sharp rise from the current 37 GW, driven by enhanced backward integration into cell and wafer manufacturing.",

        "articleBody": "Over 50% of Tata PowerTata Power Company's (Tata Power) total installed power capacity will be green by FY26, said CEO and MD Praveer Sinha on Wednesday, adding that the company does not plan to add any new thermal power capacity. Currently, our clean energy portfolio is 5,500 MW. We have another 3,700 MW of renewable projects under implementation. With this, our clean energy capacity will reach at least 9,200 MW by FY26, which will be at least 50 percent of our total installed capacity,  Sinha said on Wednesday, adding that the company has no plans to invest in any new thermal capacity. We will continue to be very renewable energy focussed. At this stage, we are not taking up any thermal power project,  said Sinha. On November 6, Union Power minister RK Singh said that India will add about 12 GW of coal-based power generation capacity by the end of this financial year amid a surge in power demand.Tata Power's existing 5,500 MW clean energy portfolio includes 3,200 MW of solar, 1,000 MW of wind, and 1,300 MW of hydropower and gas capacities.The commissioning of the 3,700 MW of wind and solar projects under execution is scheduled for the next 24 months, Sinha added. The 3,700 MW does not include 2,800 MW of pumped storage projects, works on which will begin soon. If we add the 2,800 MW of pumped storage projects as well, then Tata Power's total green energy installed capacity will touch 70 percent,  Sinha said.Tata Power's current operational capacity consists of 62% thermal power. This, however, will come down to 49% by FY26 as new renewable energy capacities get added.Tata Power reported an 8.7% increase in net profit and revenue in the September quarter on the back of robust performance across its core segments of transmission, distribution, and generation.The company reported a net profit of Rs 1,017 crore for the second quarter of FY 24, over a consolidated profit of Rs 935.18 crore last year.The consolidated revenue came in at Rs 15,738 crore compared to Rs 14,030 crore during the same period last year. Currently, Tata Power's order book comprises of group captive projects to the tune of Rs 2341 crore with orders of 161 MW in the second quarter of this fiscal.Third-party rooftop order book stands at Rs 531 crore with 74 MW installed during the second quarter. Sinha added that the company is looking at opportunities in the offshore wind and green hydrogen segment.",

        "articleBody": "China will have more than 80% of the world's solar manufacturing capacity through 2026 and will be capable of satisfying annual global demand for much of the next decade, according to a report published on Tuesday. The forecast by energy research firm Wood Mackenzie comes as nations like the United States and India are subsidizing their own solar production to reduce reliance on Chinese-made goods to achieve their clean energy goals. But China has invested more than $130 billion into its solar industry this year, the analysis said, and will bring more than a terrawatt of solar wafer, cell and panel capacity online by 2024. That's enough to meet annual global demand through 2032. The aggressive capacity expansion has already forced solar panel prices down dramatically this year and is prompting concern among U.S. producers that are banking on a government-backed domestic manufacturing boom. The United States and India combined have announced more than 200 gigawatts of module capacity plans since 2022, Wood Mackenzie said.  Despite strong government initiatives for developing local manufacturing in overseas markets, China will still dominate the global solar supply chain and continue to widen the technology and cost gap with competitors,  Huaiyan Sun, the author of the report, said in a statement.

        "articleBody": "Singapore, An Indian solar-powered tech venture that is combating food waste in the country and a global soil carbon marketplace founded by an Indian-American are among this year's five winners of the prestigious Earthshot Prize, founded by Britain's Prince William and dubbed the 'Eco Oscars', announced here on Tuesday. S4S Technologies, founded in 2013 by seven university friends Nidhi Pant, Vaibhav Tidke, Swapnil Kokte, Ganesh Bhere, Shital Somani, Tushar Gaware and Ashwin Pawade, won the award in the  Earthshot Prize to Build a Waste-Free World  category, while Boomitra, founded in 2017 by Aadith Moorthy, won the award in the  Fix our climate  category.  Among the winners is Accion Andina, a community-based initiative working across South America to protect native high Andean forest ecosystems for their invaluable benefits to nature and millions of people in the region.  Hong Kong-based company GRST won the award for developing a way to build and recycle lithium-ion batteries, while global non-profit organisation WildAid Marine Programme was awarded for scaling marine enforcement to end illegal fishing and strengthen ocean conservation.  These five winners are each awarded a GPB 1 million to help scale their solutions and accelerate their growth and impact, according to earthshotprize.org.  The work of these winners spans the globe, protecting and restoring the environment and supporting local communities across six continents, it said.  S4S Technologies combats food waste, rural poverty, and gender inequality by helping smallholder female farmers preserve and market surplus produce, the organisers said.  The firm provides rural communities with cheaper solar-powered conduction dryers and food processing equipment to prepare their crops on-site, rather than using cold storage or other more expensive methods of conventional industrial food preservation.  With a focus on supporting female farmers, S4S also supports its entrepreneurs in using the preserved waste to produce and sell valuable food products, such as ketchup. S4S creates a market, connecting commercial buyers to these products and returning most of the profits to the farmers who made them.  According to the organisers,  Some 300,000 women smallholder farmers supported by S4S have recorded 10- 15 per cent increases in their profits, while the 2,000 female entrepreneurs they partner with have seen incomes double or even triple.    Food waste, rural poverty and gender inequality are deeply intertwined challenges for the people of India. S4S's innovative solution combines cutting-edge technology with the practical support and training needed to ensure women farmers can thrive and improve their livelihoods for themselves and their families.   We are honoured by this recognition from The Earthshot Prize, and we look forward to continuing to work with our partners across India and around the world to reduce food waste, protect our natural environment and empower women,  said Nidhi Pant, Co-Founder of S4S Technologies.  Boomitra, which means  friend of the earth  in Sanskrit, is removing emissions and boosting farmer profits by incentivising soil restoration and the adoption of regenerative agriculture through a verified carbon-credit marketplace, the organisers said.  The company works with more than 150,000 farmers, from half-acre smallholder farms to large ranchers, managing more than five million acres of land in some of the poorest parts of Africa, South America and Asia.  Satellites and AI technology are used to monitor improvements farmers make to the soil, tracking its ability to store carbon over time.   We cannot restore the earth without the support of farmers, who produce the food we eat and rely on the land for their income. Our technological solution empowers farmers with the data they need to improve soil and maximise their crop yields, while creating a valuable store for carbon. Our thanks to The Earthshot Prize for recognising our work as we continue to support thousands more farmers,  said Boomitra CEO and Founder Moorthy.  On the occasion, Prince William, Founder and President of The Earthshot Prize, said that the last year has been one of great change and even greater challenge. A year in which the effects of the climate crisis have become too visible to be ignored. And a year that has left so many feeling defeated, their hope dwindling.   However, as we have seen tonight, hope does remain...From Boomitra, S4S, and Accion Andina, to GRST and WildAid Marine Programme, our winners and all our finalists remind us that, no matter where you are on our planet, the spirit of ingenuity, and the ability to inspire change, surrounds us all,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The domestic solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing capacity is expected to touch 60 gigawatts (GW) by 2025, according to Icra. At 60 GW, there will be a 62 per cent growth in module manufacturing capacity compared to the current level of 37 GW, the rating agency said on Monday.  It is likely to increase to nearly 100 GW as the capacity awarded under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme comes on stream, led by the strong policy support and growing demand from domestic solar power installations, Icra said. The solar PV module supply chain is dominated by China, with over 80 per cent share in manufacturing capacity across polysilicon, wafer, cell, and modules. In comparison, the manufacturing capacity in India is relatively low and is largely restricted to the last manufacturing stage.  The PLI scheme is expected to change this, with integrated module units expected to come up in India over the medium term.  The Government of India (GoI) has awarded incentives for setting up a module manufacturing capacity of 48 GW, including fully integrated facilities of 24 GW, i.e., from polysilicon to module.  The capex outlay for setting up these integrated module capacities is estimated to exceed Rs 1 lakh crore. Given the significant scale-up expected in manufacturing capacity, garnering a share of the global demand through exports would remain critical for domestic solar OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). Vikram V, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said,  While the abeyance of the Approved List of Models & Manufacturers (ALMM) order till March 2024 and sharp decline in global module prices is leading to an increase in PV module imports in FY2024, the expected scale-up in domestic manufacturing capacity with backward integration over the next two to three years, along with resumption of the ALMM order, is expected to reduce import dependence.  Apart from module capacity, the OEMs are expected to enhance the wafer and cell manufacturing capacities with cell capacity expected to cross 25 GW by 2025 from the current level of 6 GW. However, the country will remain dependent on polysilicon imports as these capacities are likely to take longer to set up, involving a larger capital investment, he said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Diversification of solar manufacturing and supply chains besides building adequate renewable energy storage are necessary to meet the net zero emission targets, Union Minister R K Singh told ISA member countries on Wednesday. Without these, the net zero target is going to remain only a goal, Singh, who is the president of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), said.   Net zero will remain only a goal unless the world gets together to solve the problems of lack of diversification of solar manufacturing capacity and associated supply chains,  Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister said at a session of the ISA conference.  The ISA president also said that storage remains critical for greater utilisation and round-the-clock provision of renewable energy. The developed world kept talking about the need for energy transition, they did not do anything about it.   Today, about 90 per cent of the solar manufacturing capacity is in one country, mostly dependent on one chemistry, i.e., lithium ion. This thus raises supply chain challenges, which came to the fore during the COVID-19 pandemic,  he said stressing that the round-the-clock renewable energy is not possible without storage.  India has emerged as a country with one of the fastest rates of energy transition, he said.  There is a need to work on improving efficiencies of solar technologies so that the cost of electricity comes down, which would be especially required for developing countries, Singh said.   We need to increase efficiencies in solar; these need to go up more. When we (India) began our journey, we used to need 5 acres of land for 1 MW solar, today we require 3.5 acres only. The cost of energy has come down but it will differ from country to country. If efficiency goes up, cost of electricity will come down, which will be good for developing countries where many of their people cannot pay for electricity.   Even in India, we give subsidies to populations who are below a certain income level; this will be true for all developing countries. The financial capability of governments to give subsidy is limited; so increasing efficiency is absolutely important. This will ensure that poorer people can afford electricity without government subsidies,  Singh said.",

AM Green aims to build a million tonnes a year of green methanol capacity, one of the people said.Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte and the renewable energy arm of Malaysian state oil giant Petronas Nasional Bhd. announced an investment in AM Green Ammonia Holdings, according to a statement Sunday confirming a Bloomberg News report. The project is set to produce 5 million tons of green ammonia a year, the statement showed.Discussions are ongoing and details of the fundraising could change, the people said. A representative for AM Green declined to comment. Green ammonia and hydrogen are expected to play a bigger role in electricity generation, shipping and hard-to-abate industries like oil refining, chemicals, fertilizer and steel in the coming years. In India, which is aiming for net zero by 2070, AM Green joins heavyweights Adani Group and Reliance Industries Ltd. in making ambitious investments in such technologies.Green methanol, produced from renewable sources, is seen as a climate-friendly energy source that can be used to decarbonize transportation. It can also be used as a low-carbon feedstock for making a range of industrial chemicals.AM Green, founded by Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli, is developing production capability for molecules including green hydrogen, green ammonia, biofuels, green caustic soda and e-methanol, the announcement showed. Greenko, the Hyderabad-based solar, wind and hydro power company also started by Chalamalasetty and Kolli, has received backing from GIC as well as sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, its website shows. Japanese financial firm Orix Corp. completed its acquisition of a $961 million stake in Greenko in 2021.",

The alliance, through its viability gap funding mechanism, provides a grant of $150,000 or 10% of the project cost, whichever is lower, per country per project. The assembly decided to increase the range to 35% of the project cost,  power minister RK Singh, who is also the president of the alliance, said while addressing a press conference on the organisation's sixth assembly here.The International Solar Alliance has 116 member and signatory countries. The alliance's aim is to unlock $1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing technology and its financing costs. Singh said the alliance also discussed how we can replicate in other countries what we have done in India for solar-the techno-regulatory framework, the dispute resolution mechanism and the payment security mechanism.This will encourage private sector participation, without which universal access to energy cannot be ensured, he added.

        "articleBody": "Rooftop solar projects are set to get a fillip with the introduction of the 'distributed renewable energy' segment in the latest renewable purchase obligations (RPO). This means that power distribution companies will have to mandatorily purchase renewable energy from rooftop solar projects among others included in the segment.The government recently changed the mix of renewable energy sources for mandatory purchase by distribution companies and open-access consumers, while keeping the total obligation unchanged at 2022 levels. Renewable energy projects with a capacity of less than 10 MW installed by consumers under any arrangement will qualify for renewable purchase obligation from the distributed renewable energy segment.Discoms have been apprehensive of signing power purchase agreements for rooftop solar projects and installing the required net metering systems fearing loss of revenue from their high-paying consumers, financial viability of such projects and problems in sourcing finance. The implementation of green open access rules has also shifted the market attention, leading to state power regulators prioritising it over rooftop solar approvals, according to industry experts. The provision for distributed renewable energy was added to give an impetus to the scheme, said an official who did not wish to be named.104763996 It will also make it easier for smaller energy developers to get involved, as they'll have a better idea about the trajectory of installations in these schemes [rooftop solar and PM KUSUM],  said Gaurav Upadhyay, Energy Finance Specialist (South Asia), Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).Hits and missesThe rooftop solar programme had missed its target, lagging mostly in the residential segment. The commercial and industrial segment has seen a better response even though government sees scope for small enterprises to grow more. To achieve a 40-GW rooftop solar target by 2022, the central government had launched two phases of the grid-connected rooftop and small solar power plants programme with incentives through central financial assistance. Despite the government's efforts, by the end of 2022, only 8.1 GW of rooftop solar capacity had been installed, according to a joint report from JMK Research and IEEFA issued in August. This was about double the 4.4 GW capacity as on March 31, 2019. The shortfall of around 80% in the target led the Ministry of new and Renewable Energy to extend the timeline of Phase-ll of the programme by more than three years to March 2026, the report said.FY24 will see the largest installations of rooftop solar to date of about 4 GW, of which 50% has already been installed between April and July, the report added, quoting industry estimates.In the first half of calendar year 2023, 872 MW of rooftop solar capacity was added which was 3.2% higher than the corresponding period last year, according to a report from Mercom India.",

        "articleBody": "The power ministry Wednesday notified the procedure for implementation of uniform renewable energy tariff. This is expected to boost renewable energy capacity addition as a uniform pooled tariff will create a single rate for distribution companies (discoms), removing the barrier for delay in signing power purchase agreements.In the pooled tariff system, one rate will prevail for upcoming renewable projects where the buyer of such power is more than one state. The pool will be separated into categories like wind and solar for distribution companies.An implementing agency will procure renewable power and supply to distribution companies at a uniform tariff, which will be discovered through weighted average of the pooled capacities.This will not have any impact on the tariffs for the renewable energy developers.The tariff will be computed monthly for each category of central pools -- solar, wind, hydro and others based on different technologies. Keeping future technologies in mind, the government has also created central pools for solar-wind hybrid, round-the-clock solar-wind hybrid with storage and peaking power solar-wind hybrid with storage.The system removes the rationale for distribution companies to refuse a power purchase agreement.When tariffs of solar and wind projects were falling with each auction, distribution companies delayed or cancelled signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) in anticipation of rates declining further, delaying projects.\u201cTo avoid non-signing of PPAs for projects which have higher tariff in auctions, pooling has been decided,\u201d a government official said.The start date will be notified by the government for each category of the pool, which will have a duration of five years. The power supply agreement signed within this duration will be part of the pool.\u201cThe government is providing a tariff mechanism through which the vagaries of tariff will average out over a period and across peers for a pool of projects of the same resource type,\u201d said Miren Lodha, Director - Research, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics.The power ministry had amended the Electricity Rules in January to facilitate the tariff pooling mechanism.Grid Controller of India is the nodal agency for the pooling of tariff.States may tender renewable energy capacities on their own, but it is more likely that they opt for the central pooling system. This is because capacities tendered through agencies like Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd, NTPC Ltd, NHPC Ltd and SJVN Ltd get better rates with bulk capacities. Developers also prefer bidding for such projects because of assured payments, according to an industry expert.However, it could also lead to exposure of discoms to short-term price volatility, which can potentially impact their financial stability, said Gaurav Upadhyay, Energy Finance Specialist (South Asia), Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",

        "articleBody": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that 18 per cent of the electricity generated in India will be from solar sources by 2030, up from six per cent today.IEA's new World Energy Outlook 2023 published on Tuesday indicated that renewables would provide half of the world's electricity by 2030 due to the phenomenal rise of clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, electric cars and heat pumps.The report has painted a positive outlook for world energy consumption, saying there are set to be almost 10 times as many electric cars on the road.However, it warned that emissions were still too high to prevent temperatures rising above a key threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius.In India, the report mentioned,  Eighteen per cent of the electricity generated in India will be from solar sources by 2030, up from six per cent today. India has set a target of achieving 500 GW of installed capacity from non-fossil fuels, including around 270 GW of solar capacity, by 2030. In August, the centre said that the solar power generation capacity has now surpassed the 70,000 Megawatt mark.The report highlighted policies adopted by several countries that encourage the diversification of supply chains for clean energy technologies. This includes policies to promote clean energy technology manufacturing, for instance, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, the Net Zero Industry Act in the European Union and the Production Linked Incentives scheme in India,  the report stated.The report also noted that India is the world's largest source of energy demand growth in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) ahead of Southeast Asia and Africa. Finding and financing low-emissions ways to meet rising energy demand in these economies is a vital determinant of the speed at which global fossil fuel use eventually falls,  the report suggested.

The company is also eyeing an order book of Rs 5,000 crore for the 2023-24 financial year, he added.  We are bullish on the solar market. There is a good demand for our products in domestic and international markets. Now, we are aiming for order bookings of over Rs 5,000 crore in the current fiscal from customers in India, the US, South America, Africa, Europe and the Gulf countries,  Dholakiya said in reply to a question on exports. Besides, the company will make operational another 1,000 MW of capacity by the third quarter of this fiscal, the MD informed. Gujarat-based Goldi Solar has two solar module/panel manufacturing plants, totalling 3,000 megawatts (MW) in Pipodara and Navsari districts. The company is in the process of investing Rs 5,000 crore to double its module manufacturing capacity to 6,000 MW by 2026, besides setting up a cell manufacturing unit.  There are very few companies that are into solar cell manufacturing in India. A large portion of its requirement is met through imports. As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat missions, we are setting up a cell manufacturing unit in India which will cater to the domestic demand at competitive prices, reducing dependence on imports,  Dholakiya said. On the status of the cell-making facility, he said Goldi Solar is engaged with global players for the transfer of technology, to be used in the manufacturing.  We are planning for the initial production of cells with the latest Topcon technology, which is 20-25 per cent more efficient than currently used Mono Perc cells. This aligns with our policy of bringing the latest technology to our esteemed customers and always staying ahead of the technology curve,  he added.",

        "articleBody": "Investment is increasing in the global solar energy projects, and is expected to be more than USD 380 billion this year, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) Director General Dr Ajay Mathur has said. Mathur made these remarks on Monday on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week.  The good thing is that investment flow is increasing. It was about USD 310 billion for the whole of last year, and USD 235 billion investment has come in during the first half of this year,  Dr Mathur told PTI.  We expect it to be more than $380 billion this year.  Elaborating on ISA work, he said,  Our goal is that in every member country, we make solar the energy of choice. ISA will have 120 member countries by the end of this year, up from 116 currently. The challenge is to get investments for small solar plants to reach out to the remote regions as approximately 74 per cent of the investment so far has gone to large-scale projects in the OECD and China, Dr Mathur informed.  All of Africa has received just 2-3% from these funds.  Two-thirds of the investments have gone into large solar plants and not into smaller projects.  We need to have a lot of investments in energy storage facilities as well as solar, hydro, and battery among others. Dr Mathur said ISA is also focused on capacity building, such as training and certifying people to implement and design solar projects and plants in the future. He underlined the need to train bankers on how to assess loan applications for solar development. The ISA works with member countries and  hand-hold  them through the project management process as well as helps in creating policy and regulatory frameworks that are needed for the ecosystem to happen. Dr Mathur also sees the Middle Eastern countries playing a bigger role in the development of energy and cited the example of Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, MASDAR, which has invested in renewable energy projects in 40 countries since it was established in 2006.  We have seen new investment in solar in Oman and Saudi Arabia,  he said, adding,  All these people will be the new solar producers of tomorrow.  He has pointed out that the private sector investors should not be concerned about the risk related to return on investments, especially noting these investors' reluctance to participate in project developments in Africa. The default rate in all of Africa has been less than 2%, he observed, sharing that such a risk was for late payments and not non-payments. A guarantee payment system has been created, assuring that investments would be paid back, he said. Dr Mathur emphasised the need for  pulling in and pooling of  funds for small projects and creating an ecosystem across the developing world. He highlighted the World Bank special line of credit, adding  People across the world have realised that if the energy transition is to be successful, you will have to carry everyone in this long-term development including Africa.",

        "articleBody": "The government is planning to register solar panels made up of only domestically manufactured cells, wafers and polysilicon under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers in the next 3-4 years. Minister for New and Renewable Energy RK Singh has also asked the concerned officers of his ministry to prepare a policy in this regard. ALMM was introduced by the government to boost domestic manufacturing of solar panels. The modules with less efficiency are removed from the ALMM, the minister said.  We will evolve our policies. We will only protect those modules, which are made-in-India cells. In one or two years, we will bring such a policy. Then again, after 1-2 years, we will bring a policy that wafers and polysilicon should also be made in India.  We only register those players under ALMM whose cell, wafers and polysilicon are India-made,  Singh said. The move will help in real 'Make-in-India'. The government will not promote the import of components of solar panels in the next few years, the minister said.  You import cell from outside and assemble here and sell it saying it is made in India, whereas it is 90 per cent made in China this will not do,  he said, adding that the ministry will also do a review of the ALMM next year. The government will not allow the manufacturers to endorse any outdated equipment or technology to protect the interest of the people of India, Singh added.",

Out of the 17 GW, 6 GW will be renewable-based capacity and the balance 11 GW from conventional sources, he told PTI in an interaction.  NLC is having a target of 17 GW by 2030. Based on that we have envisaged a capex of Rs 82,700 crore,  Motupalli said in reply to a question on the ongoing and future investment plans of the company. At present, NLC has an installed power generation capacity of 6 GW which comprises 1.4 GW from green sources, the CMD said. The company has set a capex target of Rs 2,480 crore for the ongoing 2023-24 fiscal, he said adding NLC will achieve 80 per cent capex utilisation by December as the target set by the Ministry of Coal. Sharing the details of the ongoing projects he said a 3x660 MW thermal power plant is being set up at Ghatampur in Uttar Pradesh. The Rs 19,406 crore project is being set up as a joint venture between NLC and the Uttar Pradesh government. At Talabira in Odisha, NLC is setting up a 3 x 800 MW pithead thermal power plant at a cost of Rs 19,422 crore. The project is set to kick off by the end of this year as tendering for the project is at the final stage.  We are also envisaging 2x660 MW or 1320 MW plant in Neyveli area (Tamil Nadu) with a capex of around Rs 12,500 crore that will be a supercritical boiler in lignite in the country. For that also we target to award the contracts by December,  he said.  In addition to whatever activities are going on, we are diversifying our activities. We are going ahead with lignite-methanol project which is the first gasification project of its kind with a capex of Rs 4500 crore. We are also converting the over burden into m-sand so that the construction industry gets construction sand.. NLC also formed two subsidiaries companies. The CMD said NLC India Renewable Energy Ltd will undertake the asset monetization programmes under which old assets will be transferred to this company which will be sold out. Another is NLC India Green Energy Ltd which will implement all the renewable projects.",

        "articleBody": "Like home appliances, consumers will soon be able to choose solar panels with higher efficiency under the government's star rating programme for solar photovoltaic module, which was launched on Friday. Union Minister for Power, New and Renewable Energy R K Singh launched the initiative which provides ratings from 1-5 stars on the basis of the efficiency of modules.  In his address, Singh said that now consumers can make an informed decision. The ratings will help consumers choose the best of the panels while getting solar installations from vendors.   Like the appliances where there is star ratings you know which appliance is better in terms of energy efficiency. Similarly, now the consumer will not be at the mercy of the seller for solar installations. By checking the star ratings one can select the more efficient panels,  the minister said.  This will also help build consumer confidence and give a push to solar installations in the country, he added.  The programme is voluntary for first two years and will be made mandatory after that, Singh said. All the panel manufacturers will have to get registered under the programme to get their products rated.  The star labelling scheme prepared by BEE for PV modules is from January 1, 2024 till December 31, 2025.  Singh also asked officials to do an annual review of the ratings programme to assess if any manufacturer is not becoming part of the initiative and take measures accordingly.  Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), under Ministry of Power, promotes the use of energy-efficient processes, equipment, devices and systems. It takes various steps to encourage preferential treatment for the use of energy-efficient equipment or appliances.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Solar power is on the verge of becoming the world's primary energy source by 2050, even without an intensified push from global climate policies, according to a new study spearheaded by the University of Exeter and University College London.This research is backed by the UK Government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, as well as the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), under the umbrella of the Economics of Energy Innovation and System Transition (EEIST) project.Dr. Femke Nijsse of Exeter\u2019s Global Systems Institute noted that the acceleration of renewables indicates a significant shift in energy paradigms.  The recent progress of renewables means that projections dominated by fossil fuels are outdated,  she remarked.Highlighting the shift in the understanding of innovation, she added,  There's an ongoing, beneficial cycle between the deployment of technologies and the increasing affordability of these implementations. This cycle illustrates the rapid solar growth in recent years and projects its expansion in the future. However, the research also brings to light several challenges that might stymie the growth of solar energy:Solar power generation is intrinsically variable, influenced by daily changes, seasonal shifts, and unpredictable weather. Nijsse commented on the need for robust solutions, stating,  Without mechanisms to address this variability, there's a risk of reverting to fossil fuels.  Resilience can be built by diversifying with other renewable sources, developing inter-regional transmission cables, augmenting electricity storage capacities, and crafting policies to manage consumption patterns, she suggested.Access to finance remains a significant hurdle. While solar's growth is tethered to the availability of funds, the focus of low-carbon finance is predominantly on affluent nations. Dr. Nadia Ameli from UCL's Institute for Sustainable Resources weighed in on this financial aspect:  Though global renewable costs have seen a notable decline, challenges persist, particularly for nations striving to secure capital on fair terms. Ensuring appropriate financing is paramount to expedite the global shift away from carbon. The impending solar-driven future brings along its set of demands, especially concerning supply chains. An increasing reliance on solar and related technologies means a heightened demand for essential minerals such as lithium, copper, nickel, and cobalt. As nations hasten their decarbonisation initiatives, these materials' demand is set to skyrocket.Lastly, the transition might face opposition from sectors experiencing decline due to the solar shift. A swift move towards solar could potentially affect the livelihoods of nearly 13 million people globally, currently anchored in the fossil fuel sector and its dependent industries.The researchers emphasized that tailored policies addressing these challenges could have a more pronounced impact on advancing the clean energy transition than conventional tools like carbon taxes.The study, titled  The momentum of the solar energy transition,  is featured in Nature Communications. Though a diverse range of institutions have contributed to the EEIST project, the expressed views predominantly belong to the authors and don't necessarily echo the stances of the UK government, CIFF, or other affiliated organizations.On a related note, the University of Exeter is gearing up to release the first-ever Global Tipping Points Report during the upcoming COP28, which promises an in-depth examination of climate tipping points and viable strategies to mitigate the escalating climate crisis.",

The study finds that solar adoption will continue apace barring any major policy shifts geared at disrupting it. \u201cIf you don't put any additional policy in your system, you still get a switch or a flip,\u201d says Femke Nijsse, a lecturer at the University of Exeter who focuses on energy-systems modeling and was lead author on the study. \u201cWe currently have a fossil fuel-dominated system and without additional policies, we arrive at a state that's dominated mostly by solar.\u201d Researchers plugged data from 70 global regions into an energy-simulation model to forecast how 22 different technologies, from geothermal energy to coal, are likely to be deployed through 2060. In 72% of the simulations, they found that solar made up the majority of global power generation in 2050.Solar power is playing an important role in countries\u2019 plans to meet emissions-reduction goals set by the Paris Agreement, and as wind-power projects contend with rising costs. Many countries, including the US, UK and Canada, have pledged to reach net zero by 2050, a goal that will require overhauling the energy sources powering their electricity grids.In addition to being a cleaner choice, solar is getting cheaper. The levelized cost of solar-generated electricity \u2014 i.e. the cost per megawatt that makes it worth installing \u2014 ranges from $42 to $48, compared with $74 for coal, according to BloombergNEF. Jenny Chase, a lead solar analyst at BloombergNEF who was not involved in the study, says those costs will keep falling. \u201cEvery time you double the cumulative amounts of solar-power modules that the human race has made, we bring the cost down about 29%,\u201d she says.It\u2019s not all sunny skies ahead: Rapidly transitioning to solar power without preparation can lead to economic and industrial impacts on communities, the study notes, especially those with stakes in the fossil fuel industry. The researchers found that up to 13 million people worldwide risk losing their livelihoods to renewables adoption. Fluctuations in weather and sun exposure also mean that overreliance on solar could cause grid instability and vulnerability. That may still be an improvement over reliance on fossil fuels, but it\u2019s \u201cnot a scenario where you want to go,\u201d Nijsse says. \u201cYou need policies to steer it towards a more sustainable scenario.\u201d 104570569To steer solar\u2019s rise, governments should invest in other renewable energy sources, including wind and hydro, and help affected communities with retraining and development programs, according to Nijsse. The industry will also have to overcome barriers that include supply chain constraints around critical metals and minerals, and a lack of financing in developing countries. \u201cGrid expansion is necessary to add more solar and wind and that is investment,\u201d Chase says. \u201cIt's not clear in many countries who's going to pay for it or where it should be built.\u201dBut the study\u2019s findings are promising, especially if adoption trends continue and costs keep declining, according to Chase. \u201cWe're trying to transition the entire world's energy system here,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that at least now it's cheap to replace a lot of the power system with solar is really good news.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Malaysian energy major Petronas, Indonesia's renewables firm Sun Energy and global commodities company Vitol are in talks to acquire TPG Capital's Rise Fund-backed Fourth Partner Energy, a renewables company that supplies green energy to commercial and industrial establishments, said two sources aware of the development. The majority stake sale is likely to value the company's equity base at around $450-$500 million, the sources said.TPG, which owns close to 50% stake in the business, is looking to completely exit the company through this transaction, the sources added. The incoming investor will also bring in some fresh capital to fund the growth plans of the company, which include growing its asset base to up to 3.5 gigawatts (GW) by 2025. Petronas, Sun Energy and Vitol have submitted non-binding offers and are doing diligence on the company's assets. A few other investors had also looked at the asset earlier, but these three are the ones left in the race now,  said one of the sources cited above.Petronas owns Amplus Solar in India that has an operating portfolio of 1.5 GW of renewable assets. Vitol owns around 1.2 GW of renewable assets, while Indonesia-based Sun Energy has installed over 280 MW of renewable power capacity for corporate clients.Norfund, a Norway government sponsored investment fund, which invested $100 million in the company in 2021, will continue to hold its stake, the source added.In August, Norfund invested \u20b9350 crore into the company. TPG first entered the company in 2018 investing $70 million.Fourth Partner Energy had an operating portfolio of 685 megawatts (MW) as of March 2023 growing from 248 MW as of September 2021, according to a report by credit rating agency Icra.The operating portfolio is expected to reach 1,358 MW in the near to medium term, the report noted.104477749Fourth Partner Energy posted revenues of \u20b91,018 crore in FY22, up from \u20b9459 crore in the previous year. It reported a net profit of \u20b97 crore in FY22, rising from \u20b953 lakh in the previous year. TPG, Norfund and Vitol declined to comment. Emails sent to Petronas and Sun Energy did not elicit a response. Fourth Partner Energy is in the midst of fund-raising and as it is an on-going process - we will not be able to comment on any particulars at this juncture,  said a spokesperson for Fourth Partner Energy. Renewable energy companies that supply clean energy to commercial and industrial (C&I) establishments have been attracting strong investor interest lately.In June, Canadian investor Brookfield invested $360 million in CleanMax Enviro Energy Solutions, a Mumbai-based C&I renewable energy company, acquiring a majority stake in the company. At the time, the company managed 1.6 GW of operating wind and solar projects and supplied clean energy to over 350 corporate customers.ET reported on August 31 that Australian investor Macquarie-owned C&I platform Vibrant Energy has seen acquisition interest from Sun Energy and Vitol, among others. The deal is likely to value Vibrant at an equity value of around $200 million, ET reported.The C&I renewables market in India is expected to grow by 47GW over the next five years, said a recent report from energy analyst firm Bridge To India. Corporate customers account for 51% of the country's total consumption, the report said.",

        "articleBody": "Adani Green Energy, one of India's largest renewable companies, is expanding its solar and wind power capacity. Vneet Jaain, managing director, Adani Green Energy, and director, Adani New Industries, tells Kalpana Pathak that the company plans to invest $3 billion in backward integration to support its plan to more than double its current solar manufacturing capacity. Edited excerpts:You are planning to expand your solar power capacity?Yes. Currently, we are at 4 GW and by 2027, we plan to be at 10 GW. We would be investing $3 billion over 5-7 years in expanding capacity and for this, we are backward integrating our operations through the electronic manufacturing cluster at Mundra which is spread over 700 acres. We started with solar wherein we made the modules, the cells, the wafer, and the ingots. We then have plans to go further backward on the polysilicon side. We have also formed joint ventures for the manufacturing of EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate), back sheets, aluminium frames etc. So, whatever goes as input in making a panel, we will be manufacturing it.You are also building a hybrid energy park at Khavda?Yes. We are building the world's largest hybrid renewable energy park in Khavda, Gujarat; we are setting up 20 GW of solar and wind combined, which will be operational in the next five years. Overall, we are the largest in the country with an operational capacity of 8,000 MW plus right now. This year, we would be adding around 3.5 GW and then next year, it may be 5 or 6 GW. This is the best site in the country for both solar as well as wind resources. It has not been easy to develop this place and do something at this scale. We are very excited about Khavda.What about your wind energy plans?In the wind energy segment, we were finding it very challenging to get supply from other original equipment manufacturers and there was also no control on pricing. So, we decided to start our own manufacturing platform and launched the 5.2 MW wind turbine generators. It is on the RLMM list now. Currently, we are at 1.5 GW capacity which we will scale up to 5 GW and then 10 GW in the next five to seven years.How will Adani Green fund these projects?We have around \u20b95,000 crore of cash and cash equivalent with us at Adani Green. We will look at a combination of debt and equity like we have done in the past too. What about your green hydrogen plans?We are looking at electrolyser manufacturing currently. We plan to go in a big way on green hydrogen from the supply chain sustainability aspect. We are working on all three - anion-exchange membrane, alkaline as well and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) technologies as each technology has its own advantages. Initially, we plan to manufacture green hydrogen at 1 million tonnes per annum as the first phase will be operational by 2027.What about Total Energies' participation in your green hydrogen plan?Total Energies is our partner in other businesses of city gas distribution as well as LNG marketing. There is a continuous dialogue happening with them. They recently agreed to invest $300 million in a new joint venture with Adani Green for renewable energy projects. They are our long-term partners.What about your storage plans?Like in the case of electrolysers, we are also working on both pumped hydro storage and battery technologies for round-the-clock power storage. On pumped hydro, we are working on six to seven projects in various parts of the country. The government has a vision of 500 GW by 2030, so storage is a must. So, I think the storage aspect will happen at a much faster pace.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s largest manufacturer of solar modules is calling for the government to reinstate trade barriers to protect it from competition from the likes of China and Vietnam.The temporary relaxation of a safeguard mechanism stating a list of approved solar makers in March has ushered in a flood of cheap imports, forcing local manufacturers to idle some capacity, Waaree Energies Ltd. Chairman Hitesh Doshi, said in an interview.The reinstatement of the so-called Approved List of Models and Manufacturers, a non-tariff barrier designed to control which solar makers are allowed to enter the Indian market, is the only solution, he said. \u201cWe are pleading to the government to bring it back.\u201dDelays during the pandemic led to calls for India\u2019s solar sector to diversify its supply chains. The government is now trying to balance the need to curb cheap imports to boost domestic manufacturing, while at the same time making sure local companies can keep up with demand.  104394461Import duties are pointless, Doshi said, because key solar exporters such as Vietnam have free-trade agreements with India, and Chinese suppliers have reduced prices to levels that make their cargoes competitive despite the previously enforced 40% import tax.After the government lifted the approved list, imports kept growing despite steep taxes on foreign-bought cells and modules levied in 2022 and 240 billion rupees ($2.9 billion) of government funds to aid local output. Imports from April through August surged almost sevenfold from the same period a year earlier, according to BloombergNEF.Mumbai-based Waaree has 12 gigawatts of modules capacity in India and 5.4 gigawatts of cells manufacturing infrastructure is in the works. It is also building a 2 gigawatt modules factory in the US, which is expected to begin operations by April 2024. The company is discussing a plan for a public float, details of which should be firmed up by the end of this month, Doshi said. The Economic Times reported last week that Waaree is seeking to raise $350 million, at a valuation of $3 billion.",

        "articleBody": "Sterling & Wilson Renewable Energy (SWREL) missed scheduled payments to its lenders in September amid a liquidity crisis triggered by the invocation of bank guarantees by overseas clients, according to a rating report and a banker aware of the development. The account, however, remains standard. The company informed lenders that the account would be regularised by the end of this month, and the missed payment is due to temporary liquidity issues that are being addressed, said the banker cited above. In the last week of September, the company's board approved a proposal to raise \u20b91,500 crore in the form of debt or equity. ET had reported on September 6 that the company planned an equity share sale of \u20b91,500 crore to repay debt maturing this financial year. At present, the account is classified as a special mention account-0 (SMA-0), which effectively indicates that payment is overdue for less than 30 days. This status can be reversed if the payments are made by the company. The company had a debt obligation of \u20b9426 crore in the month of September, of which it missed making payments of \u20b9217 crore, said a statement issued by India Ratings. SWREL did not respond to ET's request for comment. Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd has an 18.5% stake in the power generating company, wherein a Reliance Industries-linked entity has picked up 40% equity in 2022. A few months ago, overseas clients invoked two bank guarantees amounting to \u20b9390 crore ($47.2million), alleging improper execution of a project undertaken by its overseas subsidiary Sterling and Wilson International Solar FZCO. Sterling claims that the bank guarantees were wrongfully invoked and initiated legal action against the two customers, according to a stock exchange disclosure by the company.The company has partially honoured the BG, however, as on September 30, 2023, around Rs 270 crore (USD33.1 million) was yet to be honoured. India Ratings stated that the company may not have adequate internal cash flows to meet the repayments of Rs 332.3 crore due in October. The liquidity situation worsened owing to the invocation of BG, the rating company said. SWREL has a schedule of around Rs 770 crore during September-October 2023, IndiaRatings and Research said in a report on September 4.The management intends to honour the balance BGs and the scheduled repayments by raising funds, the rating company said.The company has an order book of Rs 490 crore on June 30. In the first quarter, it secured two projects \u2013 one each at Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh \u2013 amounting to Rs 470 crore. In August, it also secured an order of 600mw amounting to Rs 1130 crore from Gujarat Industrial Power Company.",

I am proud to share that the prestigious MIT Technology Review has listed ReNew in its inaugural list of '15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch', a new global list highlighting established businesses and startups that have the greatest potential to substantially reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and climate threats,  Sumant Sinha, founder, Chairman and CEO of ReNew, said. He made the remarks in an internal communication to the company's employees. The editorial team at MIT Technology Review undertook an exhaustive process, involving consultation with multiple industry experts, investors, academic sources, and global editors while scanning through company materials, comparing technical approaches, and assessing the scientific credibility of various claims before arriving at the final list, he noted.  ReNew, finding its place in the very first edition, among recognisable global players, is a testament to our pioneering work in the field of clean energy and climate action. As we increasingly play a critical role in India's energy transition, this recognition also acknowledges our potential to help India get closer to its decarbonisation targets by pursuing new areas like battery storage and cleaner forms of hydrogen,  he said. The list, premiered on Wednesday at this year's MIT ClimateTech conference, joins MIT's long-running features covering important new developments in science and technology, focusing on companies developing technologies that could achieve low enough costs and large enough scales to transform massive sectors.",

        "articleBody": "Billionaire Gautam Adani's group is planning to build 10 GW of integrated solar manufacturing capacity by 2027, as it looks to capture energy transition business, sources close to the company said. Adani Group currently has a solar manufacturing capacity of 4 GW. Adani Solar has a confirmed order book of over 3,000 MW in exports that are to be serviced over the next 15 months, they said, adding Adani, recently, raised USD 394 million for solar manufacturing from Barclays PLC and Deutsche Banks AG through a trade finance facility. While India scaled up its solar energy generation from 2.63 GW in March 2014 to 71.10 GW in July 2023, the manufacturing ecosystem did not match the pace. To change, the government adopted a two-pronged strategy - used trade and non-trade barriers, such as safeguard duty, an approved list of module manufacturers (ALMM), and a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. This gave Indian solar manufacturing the necessary impetus to encourage private players like the Adani group to scale up investments in the solar manufacturing sector. After the success of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) - the listed renewable energy generation entity of the group, Adani Enterprises (AEL) made strides in lining up and incubating solar PV manufacturing with Adani Solar in 2015. Adani Solar commenced manufacturing in 2016, with a 1.2 GW cell and module manufacturing capacity. In less than 6 years, Adani Solar enhanced its manufacturing capacity to more than three-fold to 4 GW module and 4 GW cell capacity today, making it one of the fastest-growing (in terms of capacity expansion) solar manufacturing companies. Adani has built India's largest solar PV capacity for cells and modules at the Mundra SEZ, sources said, adding since inception, Adani Solar has sold over 7 GW of modules, catering to both Indian and global demand. As per Mercom's India solar market Leaderboard 2023, Adani Solar ranked amongst the top 3 solar module suppliers in 2022. Adani Solar is now building the world's first fully integrated and comprehensive solar manufacturing ecosystem of 10 GW in Mundra, Gujarat, by 2027. It will be the group's largest manufacturing set-up and is expected to create over 13,000 green jobs, they said. The facility will play host to the entire solar manufacturing ecosystem from metallurgical grade Silicon to PV modules, including ancillaries and supporting utilities, which are all geographically co-located. With deep backward integration across the value-chain for modules, cells, ingots, wafers, polysilicon, and ancillaries - EVA, Backsheet, glass, aluminium frames, junction box and tracker, Adani Solar will boost India's position as the global solar manufacturing hub. Sources said Adani Solar has been the early adopter of new technologies and has been at the forefront of implementing digital transformation. The company's alliances with leading global institutes and certification laboratories like ISC, UNSW, PI Berlin, Fraunhofer, etc. have helped in strengthening its technology prowess. India's solar cell and module exports by domestic original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) stood at Rs 8,840 crore in the financial year 2022-23 (FY23), which is a massive 364 per cent jump from Rs 1,819 in FY22, according to rating agency Icra.",

        "articleBody": "Industry body Indian Biogas Association (IBA) expects around Rs 1,500 crore investment announcement in the biogas segment during 3-day long Renewable Energy India Expo 2023, beginning on Tuesday. The IBA comprises operators, manufacturers, and planners of biogas plants.   Renewable Energy India Expo 2023 (REI) will bring an opportunity worth Rs 1,500 crore. The participation is expected to increase by 25 per cent from last year,  an IBA statement said.  According to the statement, major Indian conglomerates like Reliance Industries and Adani Solar will be part of the REI.  The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and National Institute of Bio - Energy is supporting the biogas pavilion.  The REI is scheduled to be held from October 4 to 6, 2023 at the India Expo Centre, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh.  The expo is one of the largest trade expositions and events, focusing on renewable energy (bio-energy, solar, and wind) and energy efficient technologies including electric vehicles and battery storage.  The objective of the exhibition is to accelerate India's pledge towards net zero emission.  A R Shukla, IBA president said in the statement,  Last year REI saw a huge success with the number of initiatives announced. We are expecting to generate lots of queries from the investors from this year's exhibition.   With the Global Biofuel Alliance announced recently, (during the G20 meeting) the international interest in India will be highly contagious considering the available opportunity in India, he said, adding that  We are expecting almost 25,000 plus footfalls with the renewed interest and the government's push towards the Bio-Energy sector.    The REI over the years has been providing platforms for many national and international industry players to showcase their capabilities. This year with the renewed focus on the Biogas sector the industry has an opportunity to replicate the success of Solar energy in the country,  Gaurav Kedia, Chairman, IBA said.  The present contribution of the Biogas sector in the energy mix is much less than one per cent but it is expected to go up significantly by the year 2030, he said.  The REI Expo for the last few years has become one of the largest-platform for national and international manufacturers, traders, buyers, promoters and planners of the renewable energy domain to showcase their newer technologies, products and improve industry interaction.  The IBA is the first nationwide and professional biogas association for operators, manufacturers and planners of biogas plants, and representatives from public policy, science and research in India.",

        "articleBody": "A solar-powered tech venture that is combating food waste in India is among 15 worldwide finalists competing for the GBP 1 million 2023 Earthshot Prize, founded by Britain's Prince William and dubbed the 'Eco Oscars'. S4S Technologies, founded in 2013 by seven university friends Nidhi Pant, Vaibhav Tidke, Swapnil Kokte, Ganesh Bhere, Shital Somani, Tushar Gaware and Ashwin Pawade, is shortlisted in the  Earthshot Prize to Build a Waste-Free World  category as the finalists were unveiled by the royal during a visit to New York on Tuesday. S4S, which stands for Science for Society, made the cut for its work in tackling food waste, rural poverty, and gender inequality by helping smallholder female farmers preserve and market surplus produce.  The organisation provides rural communities with cheaper solar-powered conduction dryers and food processing equipment to prepare their crops on-site, rather than using cold storage or other more expensive methods of conventional industrial food preservation,  notes the Earthshot Prize. With a focus on supporting female farmers, S4S also supports its entrepreneurs in using the preserved waste to produce and sell valuable food products, such as ketchup. S4S creates a market, connecting commercial buyers to these products and returning most of the profits to the farmers who made them.  Food waste, rural poverty and gender inequality are deeply intertwined challenges for the people of India. S4S' innovative solution combines cutting-edge technology with the practical support and training needed to ensure women farmers can thrive and improve their livelihoods for themselves and their families,  added co-founder Nidhi Pant. The Prince of Wales announced the 15 finalists at the second Earthshot Innovation Summit, held alongside the UN General Assembly in New York to celebrate and champion innovators focused on solving our most pressing global climate challenges. The 15 innovators shortlisted represent six continents and were chosen from more than 1,100 nominees. Each of the finalists will be in the running to receive one of the five GBP 1 million prizes awarded at the third annual Earthshot Prize awards ceremony in Singapore on November 7. Founded by Prince William in 2020, the Earthshot Prize aims to discover and help scale the world's most innovative climate and environmental solutions to protect and restore our planet. The prize is centred around five  Earthshots  of Protect & Restore Nature; Clean Our Air; Revive Our Oceans; Build A Waste-free World; and Fix Our Climate. In addition to their eligibility for the GBP 1 million prize, all finalists receive mentorship, resources, and technical support from the Earthshot Prize Fellowship Programme, a year-long programme for each cohort of 15 Finalists to accelerate the growth of their groundbreaking solutions. That support includes access to the prize's robust network of influential businesses, investors, and climate experts, including the Earthshot Prize's Global Alliance of Partners, comprised of some of the world's largest businesses, donors, investors, and environmental organisations committed to climate action. The five winners of this year's prize will be selected by Prince William and the prestigious Earthshot Prize Council, a global body of activists, experts, and influencers.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Reserve Bank is examining a recommendation from banks to include loans to solar panel manufacturers within the priority sector lending bracket and is expected to take a decision in the next two-three months, people familiar with the deliberations said. After discussion with all stakeholders, two recommendations were agreed upon. While banks have sought priority sector tags for solar panel manufacturers, the renewable energy ministry has made a case for considering modifications in the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for this sector,  said an official requesting anonymity.Officials from the ministries of finance and renewable energy as well as bankers have held several meetings over the past two months on financing-related issues faced by solar photovoltaic makers, following which the recommendations were sent by the banks.Solar associations have argued that duty-free imports from Southeast Asian countries under free trade agreements, or FTAs, are hurting domestic manufacturers.103766500A bank executive said the finance ministry had asked lenders to share their inputs for the formulation of a policy to ease financing for the sector. The proposal to include this in priority sector lending and PLI schemes is in line with the discussion held with association members and representatives of the renewable energy ministry,  he said.Earlier, solar associations had argued that solar exports hadn't come down as expected. We have apprised the government that these could be Chinese manufacturers, who have shifted their base to these countries and are exporting from there,  said an association member, adding that as per the data they shared with the government, in the last 2-3 months, solar imports from countries with whom India has FTAs have increased by 48%.As per report by energy think-tank Ember, solar module imports from China decreased nearly 80%, or by $2 billion in value, in first half of 2023.  This followed imposition of tariffs as India shifts away from imports to focus on building and utilising domestic manufacturing capacity. India's domestic solar module manufacturing capacity has stepped up,  the report said.",

        "articleBody": "London: A small cleantech firm in south-east England has secured a GBP 4 million order to supply its technology to a projected 2.0-gigawatt solar facility in Mundra, Gujarat, according to a top company official. Gas Recovery and Recycle Limited (GR2L), an MSME (micro small and medium enterprise) business in Surrey, claims to have developed, patented and exported cutting-edge technology to reduce the energy consumption, carbon footprint and cost of manufacturing solar panels. It was backed by UK Export Finance (UKEF), the UK government's export credit agency, with a GBP 475,000 guarantee issued under its Bond Support Scheme that helped secure the Indian order.   Building on our existing export successes, support from Lloyds Banks and UKEF helped us to secure this latest growth opportunity and further develop our established international presence. I look forward to commissioning our machinery by the end of 2023,  said Rob Grant, CEO and founder of GR2L.   With production of brand-new argon creating up to a tonne of carbon dioxide for every tonne of argon, our cutting-edge gas recycling technology helps solar facilities reduce their scope 3 CO2 emissions and produce solar fuel cells more efficiently,  he said.  Makers of solar panels use argon gas to purify silicon crystals, which are then used in solar cells. This process requires vast amounts of argon, with some producers needing to ship in multiple tankers of the gas each day. GR2L's ArgonO machinery claims to be a world first which allows solar cell production - as well as other advanced manufacturing activities like microelectronics production, 3D metals printing and aerospace heat treatments - instead to recycle up to 95 per cent of argon used.  GR2L had an opportunity to supply its argon recycling technology to Mundra Solar Technology Ltd. to support a solar facility being built in the town.  At the same time, the Surrey SME needed to obtain payments in advance of making any deliveries to Mundra. To secure these payments, it had to issue a guarantee to assure the buyer that it could deliver, which would have meant making a cash deposit through its bank, Lloyds Bank. This, however, would have restricted the funds that the company needed for delivering the very same orders it wanted to secure.  The guarantee issued under UKEF's Bond Support Scheme meant that GR2L could instead reclaim this portion of the cash deposit, allowing GR2L to access crucial funds needed to deliver the Mundra contract and secure this major exporting opportunity.   It is good news that GR2L, a micro-business which has the edge in international markets thanks to the strength of its patented UK technology, is now going even further with the backing of UK Export Finance,  said Lisa Maddison-Brown, UKEF Export Finance Manager for Kent, East Sussex and West Sussex.   This announcement shows the value which we, working alongside financial institutions like Lloyds Bank, can bring to innovative companies - including small businesses like GR2L - to grow their global presence,  she said.   Gas Recovery and Recycling Ltd is exactly the type of business we want to see thriving. As a bank, we are committed to helping Britain prosper, so it's fantastic to see the exporting ambitions of this firm grow with the support which we can offer alongside UKEF's through our Working Capital facility. Their contract with Mundra Solar Technology Ltd is a testament to that,  added Colin Walls, Regional Director, Trade & Working Capital and Lloyds Bank.  The UK government said GR2L's export success story underscores the value of the UK-India trading relationship and its role in promoting innovation.",

        "articleBody": "More than two-thirds of the world's population favours solar energy, five times more than public support for fossil fuels, a global poll has found. The survey, conducted by Glocalities in collaboration with advocacy groups Global Citizen and The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, was based on interviews with more than 21,000 people in 21 countries between January and June. The countries included Australia, Brazil, China, India, Italy, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey and the United States. With 68% support, solar power was the most popular energy source, trailed by wind (54%), hydropower (35%) and nuclear (24%), with only 14% of respondents saying they favoured fossil fuels, the survey found. The Glocalities poll reinforced other surveys showing robust support for renewables in Europe and the United States. The EU's latest Eurobarometer from May-June found 85% of Europeans support  investing massively  in renewable energies, such as wind and solar power. A Pew Research Center poll from early 2022, which pre-dated a global spike in energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, showed 69% of U.S. adults prioritised developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar over expanding the production of oil, coal and natural gas, down from 79% two years earlier. In the United States, the Glocalities poll found, solar energy was also the most favoured power source at 58%, while fossil fuel was supported by 24%, well ahead of the global average. Fossil fuels, however, still accounted for 77% of global energy consumption in 2022, said Michael Sheldrick, Co-Founder and Chief Policy, Impact and Government Affairs Officer at Global Citizen.  This 'production gap' highlights a concerning paradox: despite strong public support for renewable energy, fossil fuel production remains prevalent,  he said.  Regardless of demographic or political affiliation, Democrat or Republican, solar power emerges as the world's preferred energy source...(which) indicates that there exists a common ground where political agendas can align with the clear demands of citizens,  he added. Global energy demand rose 1% last year and record renewables growth did nothing to shift the dominance of fossil fuels, the most recent Statistical Review of World Energy report said. Scientists say the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels to have any hope of meeting the international Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

        "articleBody": "For long, India has been utterly dependent on China for solar energy equipment. With nearly 90% of it being imported from China, India has been in a hurry to build up domestic manufacturing capacity under Make-in-India programme and with the ambitious scheme of Production-linked Incentives (PLI).Now, India's solar economy seems to be slipping out of China's grip. India\u2019s solar module imports from China reduced nearly 80% by $2 billion in the first half of 2023, according to Chinese export figures collated by energy think tank Ember. The total solar module imports declined 76% to 2.3 GW between January and June 2023 from 9.8 GW in a similar period from a year ago, according to an ET analysis of Ember\u2019s data, A report by the New Delhi-based Global Trade Research Initiative says the imports of solar cells, parts and diodes from China dropped 70.9% in 2022-23. The Chinese supremacyChina supplies nearly three quarters of the world\u2019s solar panels. It had an early mover advantage when it started to grow its solar industry more than a decade ago. It established an end-to-end supply chain \u2014 the country now makes most of the world\u2019s polysilicon, a key material in solar panels \u2014 and ignored pleas by environmentalists to close coal plants that supply the cheap electricity needed to make solar equipment, as per a Bloomberg report. It also kept its labor costs lower than those in most industrial countries and has been willing to prop up unprofitable operations. U.S. companies, which 20 years ago made 22% of them, now produce just 1% on American soil, according to Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF. At one point there were 75 major solar parts factories in the U.S., a number that was expected to grow as the industry flourished. Most have since been shuttered, unable to face the Chinese onslaught.How India is weaning itself off from Chinese importsJust as the rest of the world depends on China for solar energy equipment, so does India, more so because the government has been trying to ramp up production of renewable energy in India in recent times. Chinese imports ensured that India's local solar manufacturing didn't strike roots due to ultra cheap prices of imports form China which has a huge advantage due to massive scale as well as a robust end-to-end supply chain it has created.Then how did India\u2019s solar module imports from China reduce nearly 80% in the first half of 2023? What moved the needle was the duties India imposed on Chinese imports. In April 2022, it levied a basic customs duty of 40% on solar modules and 25% on cells. But that wasn't the only reason. As demand rises steeply, even high duties won't dent the volume of Chinese imports much due to low local manufcauring capacity. Moreover, a drastic reduction in Chinese imports due to duties hampers the hectic pace at which India is building its solar energy projects. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy made the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) compulsory besides imposing the duties. This helped engineering, procurement and construction companies looking to procure from India. The ALMM is a list of models and manufacturers of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules put out by the ministry. Rules mandate that government or government-backed projects should use only these models and manufacturers of solar PV modules, thus shutting out solar module imported from China. Today, the list has about 66 manufacturers.The PLI scheme is expected to create around 48 GW domestic module manufacturing capacity within the next three years. A total integrated capacity of 8,737 MW was allocated under Tranche-I of the scheme in November-December, 2022. The government allocated a total capacity of 39,600 MW of domestic solar PV module manufacturing capacity to 11 companies, with a total outlay of Rs. 14,007 crore under the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules (Tranche-II). Manufacturing capacity totaling 7400 MW is expected to become operational by October 2024, 16,800 MW capacity by April 2025 and the balance 15,400 MW capacity by April 2026. Tranche-II is expected to bring in an investment of Rs. 93,041 crore. Considering the two tranches together, the total domestic solar PV module manufacturing capacity allocated under the PLI scheme is 48,337 MW, with a cumulative support of more than Rs. 18,500 crore by the government. Challenges aheadThough India's solar industry is now showing encouraging signs of growth, it will have to work harder to face the challenge of reducing Chinese imports while not hurting local solar capacity building which gets hit when cheap Chinese imports are not available as much as required and local indsutry can't meet the steep demand. That's why the government has suspended the ALMM till March 2024, the list of manufacturers which were the sole suppliers for government and government-funded projects.A new challenge at present is the historic lows hit by prices of Chinese solar modules, mainly due to a spike in production of polysilicon and oversupply in the European market. While this is a good news for India since it will help India's efforts to create solar power capacity at an rapid pace, it will also further hit locally made quipment since ultra-low Chinese imports drive them out of the market.Weaning India off cheap Chinese solar imports must be seen as a long-term project which requires the government to face the challenges with nifty policies. The recent downturn in imports is certainly a ray of hope.",

        "articleBody": "India will emerge as a key player in renewable energy equipment supply chain globally and become an exporter as its solar manufacturing capacity alone would touch 100GW by 2026, a top official said. The government is implementing a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme with an outlay of Rs 24,000 crore which is estimated to aid setting up 48 GW of solar equipment manufacturing capacity by 2026.   We aim to create India as a leading global supplier of renewable energy (equipment),  New & Renewable Energy Secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said at a CII event here.  Bhalla said the solar PLI scheme worth Rs 24,000 crore will create 48GW of new RE manufacturing capacity in next three years.  India has 28GW of solar module manufacturing capacity and 6GW of solar cell manufacturing capacity at present, he said.  After the implementation of the PLI scheme for solar, India should be in a position to have 100GW solar module manufacturing capacity, he pointed out.   We need to add 30GW to 40GW of solar power capacity every year. We still have a very large substantial capacity for exports. That is why, India will become a key player in the global supply chain (of solar equipment),  he said.  India has an ambitious target of having 500GW of RE capacity by 2030 and aims to have 50 per cent of its electric power capacity from non-fossil fuel based source like solar, wind energy and green hydrogen.   We aim that India becomes a leading manufacturer of solar modules. India is poised to become a global hub of RE manufacturing,  he said.  Bhalla added that India has 15 GW of wind energy (turbine) manufacturing capacity at present.   We aim to achieve 50 per cent of our electric power from non-fossil fuels by 2030. India has installed renewable energy (RE) generation capacity of 178 GW as of August 2023 and witnessed the fastest RE capacity addition over the past years,  he stated.  India has the fourth largest RE capacity in the world, he informed.",

Beijing had set a goal of boosting the country's installed capacity of wind and solar power to more than 1,200 GW by 2030. China had installed 365 GW of wind power capacity and 392 GW of solar capacity by the end of last year - about a third of the world's total. The country's installed capacity is expected to top 500 GW by the end of 2023, the note added.  China's national program to build out solar capacity, launched in June 2021, has led to a significant boost in large-scale projects,  said Yicong Zhu, senior renewables and power analyst at Rystad. The note added China's investment in solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity was 3.4 times higher than its investment on thermal power during the first half of 2023. However, utility-scale solar PV development, that produce 10 megawatts (MW) or more of energy, has been concentrated in its less populous northwestern parts due to geographical advantages.  There is limited land availability and costs are high in coastal regions, so large-scale utility solar PV developments are not feasible,  the note added. The challenges have paved the way for more investment in rooftop solar and provinces such as Henan, Shandong and Hubei have seen a surge in installations, Rystad said. Despite the growth, some provinces are lagging behind in meeting their province-specific goals for installed capacity, the note added.  Overall, all provinces will need to bring at least 250 GW of solar PV capacity online by the end of 2025 to achieve their respective targets,  Rystad noted.

The capacity of small-scale solar increased from 7.3 GW in 2014, to 39.5 GW by 2022, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy said. Small-scale solar - also called distributed solar or rooftop solar, refers to solar-power systems with 1 megawatt (MW) of capacity or less, and accounted for about one-third of the nation's total solar capacity. The U.S. solar industry was expected to add a record 32 GW of production capacity this year, helped by investment incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act. Hawaii has the highest small-scale solar penetration, with 541 watts per person, despite California having the biggest small-scale solar capacity at 36%, the EIA said. New York and New Jersey-mid-Atlantic states with less year-round sunshine-have the second- and third-most small-scale solar capacity, respectively, although in recent years, sunny Texas and Arizona have been closing the gap, the agency said.",

        "articleBody": "The country recorded a 3.6 per cent decline in new installations of open-access solar capacity to 712 megawatt (MW) in the June quarter, according to a report by Mercom India.  India added 739 MW of open-access solar capacities in the year-ago period, the research firm said in its 'Q2 2023 Solar Open Access Market Report.' However, on a quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) basis, the capacity addition was 24 per cent higher than the 577 MW in the January-March quarter, the report said.  Open access enables consumers with over 100 kW sanctioned load to buy cheaper power from the open market.  In the January-June period, India added 1.3 GW of open-access solar capacity, down almost 18 per cent compared to 1.6 GW installed in the year-ago period.   In the period under review, the green energy open access regulation has been a major enabler for increased solar capacity addition under open access, even though lack of uniform rules in states was a challenge.   Hybrid power projects with a combination of solar, wind, and even energy storage are proving to be sound investments for corporates,  Mercom India Managing Director Priya Sanjay said.  As of June 2023, the country's cumulative installed open-access solar capacity was 9.8 GW.  During the April-June period, Gujarat added the highest open-access solar capacity accounting for over 46 per cent of the 712 MW addition, followed by Karnataka (21 per cent) and Tamil Nadu (10 per cent).  In the January-June period, Karnataka's contribution was the highest at 34 per cent, followed by Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, at 13 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.   Climate change mitigation and decarbonisation goals are increasingly becoming key drivers for large corporations while procuring green power,  Sanjay said.",

        "articleBody": "The US solar industry expects to add a record 32 gigawatts (GW) of production capacity this year, up 53% on new capacity in 2022 and helped by investment incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, a report published on Thursday showed. The report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie estimated total operating solar capacity would grow from 153 GW currently to 375 GW by 2028 as supply chain challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive trade policies abate. Increased investment in domestic manufacturing could see U.S. solar module production grow tenfold by 2026 if all new factory plans materialise, Wood Mackenzie said.  In the year since its passage, the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) has undoubtedly caused a wave of optimism across the solar industry,  said Michelle Davis, head of global solar at Wood Mackenzie. The Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act allocates about $370 billion toward climate change and clean energy efforts, including incentives aimed at promoting solar and wind power.  Announcements for domestic module manufacturing have exploded, promising more stable solar module supply in the future. Now the challenge becomes implementation,  Davis added. In February, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. developers have plans to add 54.5 GW of fresh electric generating capacity in 2023, with over 50% of it driven by solar energy sources. The utility-scale and residential solar markets led the way with new capacity additions in the second quarter, mainly as customers in California rushed to install solar before changes to net metering rules took effect, the report said. Florida continues to dominate the 2023 state solar rankings, installing 2.5 GW of new capacity in the first half of this year, the report stated. ",

        "articleBody": "Sanchi, the historic home to the renowned Stupa, which has illuminated the world for over two millennia, now holds the distinction of being India's first 'solar city'. In an official ceremony, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan marked this significant achievement on Wednesday, drawing a parallel to the enlightening legacy of Lord Buddha, a TOI report stated. He said,  By becoming the country's first solar city, this historic place has shown the way to the world, the same way as Lord Buddha once did. The solar project in Sanchi promises to make a substantial environmental impact by reducing carbon dioxide emissions by a staggering 14,324 tonnes annually.Currently, a 3 MW solar plant caters to the city's energy needs and is fully operational. Simultaneously, a 5 MW plant, dedicated to fulfilling agricultural requirements, is under construction. The 3 MW plant occupies a 5-hectare land close to the Unesco World Heritage site.Once completed, Sanchi is poised to generate surplus energy compared to its consumption. Chief Minister Chouhan also highlighted the broader initiative in the state, including the construction of a 600 MW electricity-producing solar plant on the dam water in Omkareshwar. He reaffirmed the commitment to source power from green alternatives rather than thermal plants, recognizing the detrimental environmental impact of the latter.Sanchi's green transition also encompasses the development of energy-efficient devices, e-charging stations, solar streetlights, and solar water pumps for the civic body. Farmers in the region will receive support in installing solar pumps, as per the Chief Minister's announcement.Additionally, every household in Sanchi is set to benefit from low-energy-consumption fans, bar lights, and LEDs. Approximately 2,000 students will receive solar lights, while street vendors will be equipped with solar lanterns. Remarkably, all the necessary equipment has already been procured using Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds, as disclosed by sources.The solar city project aims to generate an amount of energy equivalent to the total consumption of the town, feeding surplus energy into the grid. The inauguration of the solar city was initially scheduled for May 3 but was rescheduling to August 17 and then finally to September 6, closer to the assembly elections.",

India's cumulative rooftop solar capacity reached 9.6 gigawatts (GW) at the end June 2023, the 'Mercom India Rooftop Solar Market Report' said.  In the second quarter, 387 megawatts (MW) of rooftop solar capacity was added, which is 20 per cent higher compared to January-March 2023, and marginally down by 0.5 per cent over April-June 2022.   Rooftop solar did not meet expectations in H1, even with falling component prices and growing demand. We see a much stronger second half as installers holding out for better margins start ramping up installations and meeting demand at a much quicker pace  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.  The capacity additions by residential consumers accounted for 54 per cent, industrial consumers 25 per cent, and commercial consumers 21 per cent.  Industrial installations were primarily in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), automobile and auto component sectors, among others.  Gujarat was the leading state for cumulative rooftop solar installations, followed by Maharashtra and Rajasthan.",

The country added 4 GW of solar capacity in the year-ago quarter, the research firm said in 'Q2 2023 India Solar Market Update'.   India added 1.7 GW solar capacity in Q2 of 2023. (New) installations dropped more than 10 per cent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) compared to 1.9 GW in the January-March period,  it said.  Capacity additions fell almost 58 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) compared to 4 GW in the year-ago period.  Large-scale solar projects accounted for 77 per cent of the capacity added during the quarter, and rooftop solar installations contributed 23 per cent. Over 1.3 GW of large-scale solar capacity was added in the quarter, down 64 per cent y-o-y, and 7 per cent q-o-q.  During January-June, new installations were at 3.6 GW, down 53 per cent from 7.6 GW during the same period last year.  India's cumulative installed solar capacity surpassed the 66 GW-mark in June.   Delays, extensions, and postponements have led to a substantial number of solar projects being deferred to next year, making 2023 a year of setbacks for solar in India,  Raj Prabhu, Chief Executive Officer of Mercom Capital Group, said.   Consequently, 2024 looks extremely robust. Rapidly declining solar component and project costs will be a catalyst for additional growth,  he said.  Following a weak first quarter, capacity additions slowed further in the second. Extensions granted to several large-scale solar projects and those facing delays due to land and transmission issues affected installations in the January-June period, he said.  During the quarter under review, Gujarat led with 41 per cent of large-scale solar installations. Rajasthan and Karnataka were next, with 20 per cent and 14 per cent of quarterly capacity additions, respectively.  During January-June, India added 8.4 GW of new power capacity, with solar accounting for over 43 per cent.",

        "articleBody": "State-owned SJVN Ltd has inked two pacts with Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL) to supply 1,200 MW of solar power from its projects, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann said here on Thursday. Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam signed two power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 1,200 MW solar power recently.  PSPCL had floated tenders for procurement of power from solar projects located in Punjab and other parts of the country.  SJVN Green Energy Limited (SGEL), SJVN's arm, proposed the rate of Rs 2.53 per unit for the supply of 1,000 MW and Rs 2.75 per unit for another 200 MW.   Earlier bidding was of Rs 2.59 per unit but it was negotiated and brought at Rs 2.53,  he said.  For 200 MW the bid had proposed the rate of Rs 2.79 per unit but it was finally agreed at Rs 2.75 per unit, Mann said, adding that the state government will save Rs 431 crore through this negotiation.  The rates have been fixed for 25 years and PSPCL will not pay any transmission charges and for transmission losses.  Lashing out at previous governments, the chief minister said that from 2007-2017 none of the power supply pact was below the rate of Rs 7 per unit.  Mann said Punjab will soon become the first state to implement policy for banking power.  We are also going to implement the power banking policy soon,  he added.  To further promote clean energy and provide maximum power to agricultural tubewells, PSPCL has floated more tenders to procure 2,500 MW solar power, the chief minister said.  SJVN is already executing a 100-MW solar project at the cost of about Rs 545 crore in Punjab.",

They are currently facing problems owing to fast-rising duty-free imports from southeast Asian countries under FTAs (free trade agreements).At a recent meeting, banks including the State Bank of India (SBI) agreed to look at easier norms of seeking collateral. They also decided to consider taking personal guarantee  only from the owner and not their immediate family .Also under discussion were some other funding-related issues the solar units had mentioned at a July meeting.The key issues discussed at the July talks included a) high borrowing costs compared to China, b) limited capital pool due to the sectoral version of banks, c) a reduced debt ceiling and d) short tenor of loans, etc, among others.Manish Gupta, president, North India Module Manufacturer Association, sought priority sector/infrastructure lending status and interest subvention for small and medium solar enterprises, the report said. They make up 50% of domestic capacity and generate more employment than mega factories. Surging FTA imports make government support necessary as panel manufacturing will need over Rs 1 lakh crore in investment over the next few years to meet solar targets,  Gutpa told ToI. The PLI (performance linked incentive) scheme has largely benefited big players. Issues are dominated by big players, leaving out small and medium module makers, who account for half of the capacity in the country ,  ToI quoted him as saying.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday hailed India's contribution towards creating awareness about the importance of renewable energy and gave the slogan of 'One Sun, One World, One Grid'. Addressing the nation on its 77th Independence Day, Modi called for connecting solar energy supply across borders.   We have presented philosophies and the world is now connecting with India over them. For the renewable energy sector, we said 'One Sun, One World, One Grid'. After COVID, we told the world that our approach should be of 'One Earth, One Health',  Modi said in his independence day speech from the ramparts of Red Fort on Tuesday.  The idea for the One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) initiative was put forth by Modi at the First Assembly of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in October 2018.  In May 2021, the United Kingdom and India agreed to combine forces of the Green Grids Initiative and the One Sun One World One Grid initiative and jointly launch GGI-OSOWOG at the COP26 summit hosted by the UK at Glasgow in November 2021.  The vision behind the OSOWOG initiative is the mantra that  the sun never sets .  The OSOWOG initiative aims to connect different regional grids through a common grid that will be used to transfer renewable energy power and, thus, realize the potential of renewable energy sources, especially solar energy.  The GGI-OSOWOG (green grid) initiative was jointly launched by Modi and the then Prime Minister of United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, during the 'Accelerating Innovation and Clean Technology Deployment' event at the World Leaders Summit held on November 2, 2021 during COP26.  Modi further said that  We paved the way to fight climate change by launching Mission #LiFE-'Lifestyle for the Environment' and made the International Solar Alliance and many countries have become part of it.   The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is an action-oriented, member-driven, collaborative platform for increased deployment of solar energy technologies as a means for bringing energy access, ensuring energy security, and driving energy transition in its member countries.  The ISA was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilize efforts against climate change through deployment of solar energy solutions. It was conceptualized on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris in 2015.  India is promoting renewable energy in the country in a big way and aims to have 500 GW of non-fossil fuel based power generation capacity by 2030. Presently India has 178GW of renewable energy capacity which includes 71GW of solar, 44GW of wind energy and 47GW of large hydro electric capacity.",

        "articleBody": "India is set to emerge as one of the largest solar module manufacturers and has the fastest growing capacity in renewable energy, Union Power Minister R K Singh said on Tuesday. Stating that India has a considerable existing solar manufacturing capacity, he pointed to  even larger capacities under construction, including polysilicon .   India is poised to become a global powerhouse in renewable energy, including green hydrogen, fostering a robust ecosystem.   With one of the largest manufacturing ecosystems in wind energy and rapidly growing capacity in solar energy, India is the world leader in this regard,  Singh said while speaking at an ICRA event in the national capital.  The minister said the country has the fastest growing capacity in renewable energy and is also set to emerge as one of the largest solar module manufacturers.  India has achieved the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 40 per cent capacity from renewable sources, he said.  Further, he said the country is on course to meet the target of 50 per cent capacity share from renewable energy well ahead of NDC's 2030 timeline.  Singh said India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, yet the per capita emission of greenhouse gases is substantially lower than the global average.  The country is striving to achieve a fine balance between meeting its surging energy needs and reducing carbon emissions, he said and added that the country remains steadfast in its commitment to sustainable growth, renewable energy expansion and electric vehicle adoption.   By strategically balancing economic growth with environmental consciousness, the nation is determined to carve a brighter, greener future for generations to come,  he said.  Ramnath Krishnan, managing director and chief executive officer at ICRA Ltd, said the country's clean energy revolution has witnessed significant progress over the past decade, fuelled by strong policy support from the central government and enhanced tariff competitiveness of solar and wind power.",

        "articleBody": "Brookfield Asset Management has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Reliance Industries, for manufacturing of renewable energy and decarbonization equipment in Australia, the company said today.The MoU aims to both accelerate and de-risk Australia\u2019s energy transition by enabling it to locally produce clean energy equipment such as PV modules, long duration battery storage and components for wind energy.Under the terms of the MoU, Brookfield will work with RIL to explore avenues of direct capital investment and development of skills, knowledge and expertise in the renewable energy sector of Australia to facilitate the nation\u2019s transition to a net zero future.  Reliance and Brookfield will evaluate the establishment of advanced operations in Australia to make/or assemble equipment used in the construction of renewable energy projects supplying equipment to all players in the market including Origin Energy Markets. Reliance has strong expertise in solar panel technology and long duration battery storage technology,  RIL said in a press statement, adding that it is currently in the process of setting up one of the world\u2019s largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in India.The MoU with Reliance is one of the key initiatives being undertaken by Brookfield to bring global manufacturing technology and expertise to Australia. In March this year, it signed a binding agreement with EIG Partners to acquire Origin Energy. The proposed acquisition is currently going through the relevant approvals processes. As part of its proposed acquisition of the Origin Energy Markets division, Brookfield along with its institutional partners and global institutional investors GIC and Temasek have set out a plan to invest between A$20 billion and A$30 billion over the next ten years to accelerate its energy transition.Luke Edwards, Brookfield Renewable Head of Australia, said: \u201cWe want to help kickstart a new era in local manufacturing that will benefit domestic renewables developers, including Origin Energy Markets, and many communities around Australia. We are establishing these types of global partnerships in manufacturing now to allow us to get started as quickly as possible given the ever-reducing timeline for Australia to reach its first emissions-reductions targets in 2030.\u201dThe MoU with RIL intends to support this investment to ensure consistent and adequate supply of the clean energy equipment required to develop up to 14 GW of new, large-scale generation and storage capacity in Australia. Independent analysis undertaken for Brookfield indicates the establishment of onshore sovereign manufacturing capability for the energy transition has the potential to create approximately 18,000 direct and indirect jobs, many in regions most impacted by the transition such as the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria.Brookfield added that it is uniquely placed to support these manufacturing initiatives given its track record in committing long-term capital to enable the energy transition, and its innovative approach to large-scale investments in re-shoring of essential and strategic manufacturing processes and supply chains such as its investment in the US$30 billion Intel Chip plant in Nevada.Anant Ambani, Director, Reliance New Energy Limited, said: \u201c...Reliance is pursuing opportunities of investment in India and globally with great enthusiasm and passion. We are confident that Reliance and Brookfield will explore avenues in green energy in Australia, accelerating the nation\u2019s transition to a Net Zero future and providing a fillip to the global green energy movement.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "First Solar of the US will invest \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d for solar panel production in India that will not source materials from China, US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm told ET. She also indicated that Tesla is in discussions for investing in India.\u201cFunding-wise, India has committed, and the private sector is clearly listening,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, US firm First Solar will invest hundreds of millions of dollars for production of solar panels in India that does not depend on any materials from China. They are doing the same expansion in the US.\u201dWhen asked about Tesla's plans to invest in India in the backdrop of the recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and company chief executive Elon Musk, the secretary said the carmaker is in talks with the Indian government. Tesla would be in India  as soon as humanly possible,  Musk had said last month. The US views India, and rightly so, as the most essential partner in the clean energy transition,  said Granholm after meeting oil and gas minister Hardeep Puri.  India has committed a significant amount in green hydrogen.  The US energy secretary also met RK Singh, minister of state for new and renewable energy.  Funding-wise, India has committed, and the private sector is clearly listening,  she said.  For example, US firm First Solar will invest billions of dollars for production of solar panels in India that does not depend on any materials from China. They are doing the same expansion in the US. Granholm elaborated on the principles underscoring the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership.  The pillar of a green strategic partnership - whether it is biofuels, green hydrogen, offshore wind, or grid or energy storage, the whole gamut of technologies - (is that) each country brings something, so we can learn from each other,  she said.  We launched something new mentioned in the leaders' summit. We will bring our 17 national labs to partner India on its own ambitions. We talked about this with minister Puri. It may be recalled that during Modi's recent US trip, the two nations committed to create innovative investment platforms that will effectively lower the cost of capital and attract international private finance at scale to accelerate the deployment of greenfield renewable energy, battery storage and emerging green technology projects in India.The US and India will endeavour to develop a first-of-its-kind, multi-billion dollar investment platform aimed at providing catalytic capital and derisking support for such projects, according to the India-US joint statement issued at the summit.Granholm said countries are focusing on homegrown solutions and creating strategic partnerships.  Every country is seeing the effects of carbon pollution,  she said.  There is an urgency to accelerate clean energy, even if there is a focus on the traditional. Then there is the question of energy security - dependence on one supplier. Countries are seeing (what happens) when they rely too much on one country - on China for battery technology and solar technology, Russia for natural gas. Countries are looking inward for energy security, and seeking partnerships to shore this up, the secretary pointed out.Founded in 1999, First Solar is a leading US solar technology company and global provider of responsibly produced eco-efficient solar modules advancing the fight against climate change, according to its website. It is unique among the world's 10 largest solar manufacturers for being the only US-headquartered company that's not manufacturing in China. First Solar's advanced thin film photovoltaic (PV) modules represent the next generation of solar technologies, providing a competitive, high-performance, lower-carbon alternative to conventional crystalline silicon PV panels.",

        "articleBody": "Buffeted by waves as high as 10 meters (32 feet) in China\u2019s Yellow Sea about 30 kilometers off the coast of Shandong province, two circular rafts carrying neat rows of solar panels began generating electricity late last year, a crucial step toward a new breakthrough for clean energy.The experiment by State Power Investment Corp., China\u2019s biggest renewable power developer, and Norway-based developer Ocean Sun AS is one of the most high-profile tests yet of offshore solar technology. It\u2019s a potential advance in the sector that would enable locations out at sea to host renewables, and help land-constrained regions accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels.Most initial trials of solar-at-sea have involved small-scale systems, and there are numerous challenges still to overcome \u2014 including higher costs and the impacts of corrosive salts or destructive winds. Yet developers are increasingly confident that offshore solar can become a significant new segment in renewable energy.\u201cThe application of this is virtually unlimited,\u201d because many regions have constraints on the use of land, including parts of Europe, Africa and Asia along with locations like Singapore and Hong Kong, said Ocean Sun\u2019s Chief Executive Officer B\u00f8rge Bj\u00f8rneklett. \u201cIn these places, you see there\u2019s a huge interest for this technology.\u201d Shandong, the industrial hub south of Beijing, plans to add more than 11 gigawatts of solar offshore by 2025, and to ultimately build 42 gigawatts, more than the current power generation capacity of Norway. Neighboring Jiangsu has a target to add 12.7 gigawatts, while provinces like Fujian and Tianjin are also studying proposals. Japan, the Netherlands and Malaysia are among other nations conducting or preparing test projects. Even with investments in solar forecast to surpass spending on oil production for the first time this year, many regions face challenges in finding land to install vast arrays of panels, either because of a lack of available space, as a result of inhospitable terrain, or because to do so would require deforestation. That\u2019s spurring the push to examine new, and sometimes unlikely, sites for solar that\u2019s already seen hundreds of floating projects delivered on lakes, reservoirs, fish farms and dams. Japan has dozens of smaller arrays, China and India have added major operations, and facilities have been built in nations including Colombia, Israel and Ghana. In January, the largest floating solar project in the US was brought fully online, supplying enough power for 1,400 homes from panels at the Canoe Brook water treatment plant in New Jersey.\u201cRenewables installation must grow, but the realistic question is where to build,\u201d said Li Xiang, head of the solar-on-water unit at Hefei, China-based Sungrow Power Supply Co., one of the world\u2019s largest renewable energy equipment makers. \u201cWe think water surfaces have great potential.\u201dStretched out across the dark green water of an artificial lake in Huainan, in China\u2019s eastern Anhui province, is an installation of about half a million floating solar panels clustered into vast blocks, with white geese swimming by. The project built by Sungrow, on the site of a former coal mine since filled with water, covers the size of more than 400 soccer pitches and generates power for more than 100,000 homes. Adding solar systems on existing reservoirs could theoretically allow more than 6,000 global cities and communities to develop self-sufficient power systems, researchers including Zeng Zhenzhong, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said in a paper published in March. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to fight for farmlands, nor do we need to cut forests or even go to the deserts,\u201d Zeng said in an interview. Yet more assessments are needed of the potential long-term consequences of covering water bodies with panels, the researchers found. China\u2019s authorities have become wary too. New developments in some freshwater locations were banned last May amid concerns about the impacts on ecosystems and flood control. A solar installation in Jiangsu province that covered 70% of a lake\u2019s surface was partially dismantled after local officials raised objections.While solar plants on freshwater sites are forecast to continue to expand globally, some of those concerns \u2014 and the potential of projects at sea \u2014 are helping to drive activity in the offshore sector. China\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology has made it a key priority to develop near-shore floating technologies by 2025, while companies such as Sungrow are among those collaborating with researchers.Ocean-based solar arrays that can handle waves of up to four meters could be ready for commercial deployment within a year, and systems able to withstand 10-meter high swells will take at least three years to perfect, according to Ocean Sun. Viable technology could be ready within one to two years, according to Southern University\u2019s Zeng, who is also studying offshore developments.Developers are experimenting with differing concepts. Ocean Sun\u2019s ring-shaped floaters, made of high-density plastic pipes and a membrane with panels laid out across the surface, undulate with the movement of waves. Rotterdam-based SolarDuck AS mounts panels on triangular platforms and has agreements to test its systems, including in Tokyo Bay and in a project off the coast of Tioman Island in Malaysia.Questions remain about the ultimate scale of the offshore solar market. Developing panels at sea could be around 40% more expensive thanks to more complex installations and costly subsea cables, according to BloombergNEF estimates. Unlike offshore wind, which produces more power than onshore farms because of stronger gusts and larger turbines, there\u2019s no major benefit to power generation in harvesting the sun\u2019s rays at sea versus land.\u201cOffshore solar in some ways is the worst of both worlds,\u201d said Cosimo Ries, an analyst with Trivium China. \u201cYou get the higher installation costs, but you don\u2019t get the higher power output.\u201d Solar-at-sea is likely to end up a niche sector, mostly serving land-starved coastal cities like Singapore, Ries said. Advocates insist the technology is fast improving, and will win a role in helping nations with large populations and a lack of land to curb emissions and \u2014 for many developing economies \u2014 to meet still rising energy demand.Longi Green Energy Technology Co., the world\u2019s biggest producer of panels, is developing modules specifically suited for conditions at sea, and has a study underway in Jiangsu province. While it sees the market size as limited now, there\u2019s \u201crelatively large potential for offshore solar,\u201d the company said in a March conference presentation in Xiamen.China alone has potential to host about 700 gigawatts of offshore solar \u2014 about as much as the combined electricity generation capacity of India and Japan \u2014 according to a State Power Investment forecast. \u201cIt is not going to be difficult,\u201d said Southern University\u2019s Zeng. \u201cPeople have not yet realized how much potential it has.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Annual renewable energy (RE) installations in FY24 are to be around 20 GW, led by the solar sub-segment, CareEdge Ratings said on Thursday. This is based on the healthy pipeline of over 55 GW assets under development. The subsequent year is expected to see installations of 25 plus GW, leading to a cumulative increase of 45 GW over the next two fiscal, the rating agency said in a sectoral note. The solar sub-segment is expected to lead the way in terms of installations, followed by wind and hybrid capacity. The commercial and industrial segment is also expected to contribute significantly to future capacity additions. These projections are based on the government's commitment to ensuring the bidding of approximately 50 GW of annual capacity for the next five years to facilitate the achievement of the target of 500 GW capacity through non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. This will require annual RE installations to exceed 40 plus GW. The trajectory for FY24 includes 10 GW of wind capacity and 40 GW collectively from solar, hybrid, and storage-based capacity. Additionally, key states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, among others, are actively conducting state-specific auctions to support further capacity additions. Meanwhile, the report stated that the Indian government has awarded a PLI (Production Linked Incentive) scheme of over Rs 18,000 crore to encourage private investment in the solar module supply chain. This is expected to lead to the establishment of a fully integrated module manufacturing capacity of 27.4 GW, a deeply integrated module manufacturing capacity of 16.8 GW, and a partially integrated module manufacturing capacity of 7.4 GW. This capacity is expected to be commissioned between FY24 and FY27. The commissioning of this domestic capacity is anticipated to result in annual forex savings of approximately Rs 90,000 crore.",

In FY23, CIL's output was 703.21 MT, out of which SECL's contribution was 167 MT.   SECL aims to become a net-zero energy company. SECL plans to develop solar projects of more than 600 MW in the coming years, and plans to invest more than Rs 1,000 crore in renewable energy. The investments are part of the company's strategy to expand and diversify its business to achieve net zero commitments,  SECL said in a statement.  Sharing the break up of the investment plan, SECL said two solar projects of 20 megawatt (MW) each are being set up at Bhatgaon and Bishrampur, and another 0.8 MW at Saraipali Korba area in Chhattisgarh. Total cost of these project is Rs 180.71 crore.  A 1.5 MW floating solar plant will be installed at Sharda OC Sohagpur area in Madhya Pradesh at a cost of Rs 9.84 crore. The detailed project report for a 40-MW solar project worth Rs 286.51 crore is under the process of approval.  A ground-mounted solar project of 60 MW worth Rs 420 crore is being set up at Johilla Phase-II and a 46-MW project worth Rs 322 crore in Hasdeo.  In FY23, SECL commissioned a 0.58 MW solar project worth Rs 2 crore. The total cost of the projects under various stages of commissioning calculates to Rs 1,220 crore.  Besides, SECL is also planning to set up solar projects totalling 436 MW on RESCO (Renewable Energy Service Company)/BOO (Build-Own-Operate) mode.",

        "articleBody": "The dispute in the promoter family of Nagpur-based Solar Industries India with nearly a \u20b935,000 crore market value has taken a new turn.Four special resolutions, including on the appointment of an independent director and alteration of the company's articles of association, moved at the annual general meeting of the industrial explosives and ammunition manufacturer last week, were defeated amid a fight between two brothers: Satyanarayan and Kailash Chandra Nuwal.In the AGM held on June 21, the promoter group led by Kailash Chandra Nuwal voted against all nine resolutions, including the adoption of the audited financial statement for the fiscal year 2022-23 and the declaration of the final dividend. While five ordinary resolutions sailed through, four special resolutions were not approved. Special resolutions need 75% of the votes in favour to be approved, while ordinary resolutions require only a simple majority. Here all resolutions got around 69% of the votes in favour and the rest against. 101375044The re-appointment of Sujitha Karnad as a non-executive independent director, alteration of the articles of association, and two other resolutions for increasing the limit of borrowings and the limit for providing security against the borrowing did not get enough votes.An email sent to the company seeking comment did not elicit any response till press time Thursday.Satyanarayan Nuwal and his family own a 43.88% stake in the company, while Kailash Chandra Nuwal and his family hold 29.28%. Satyanarayan Nuwal currently runs the company as chairman. His son, Manish, is its chief executive.Shares of Solar Industries have rallied 40% in the last one year. On Wednesday, they closed 2.51% higher at \u20b93,839.45 on the BSE, with a market capitalisation of about \u20b934,750 crore. Markets were closed Thursday. The factions of families tend to vote against resolutions impeding the smooth operation of the business, and more worrying is that these are distractions from the day-to-day functioning of a company,  said Amit Tandon, founder of Institutional Investor Advisory Services.  Unfortunately, no family seems immune from such afflictions. Like a cyberattack, with family disputes, investors need to worry about not if but when. The dispute between the brothers started when the company secretary, on July 31, 2020, sent a letter to Kailash Chandra Nuwal stating that he had automatically vacated the office on November 7, 2019, after failing to make certain disclosures. Subsequently, Kailash Chandra Nuwal moved the National Company Law Tribunal against the company and others for interim relief. The NCLT in an interim order on February 9, 2021, allowed him to act as director and vice-chairman. The company and its majority shareholders petitioned the NCLAT on February 24, 2021, but their appeal was dismissed on December 14, 2021.Many of the businesses in India are family-owned, and several run into disputes between family members. Some examples are the dispute between the Kirloskar brothers of Pune, Baba Kalyani and his sister Sugandha Hiremath over the chemical company Hikal, and Prakash and Deepak Chhabria over Finolex Cables.",

        "articleBody": "India's solar power market may be growing rapidly - but Girish Mansukbhai Solanki's business, a small labour agency that supplies workers to companies setting up solar systems in western Gujarat, has been making losses.  I am at the bottom of a supply chain that is plagued with delayed projects, delayed payments and a lot of uncertainty,  the 38-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation over tea in Rajkot, an industrial town home to many solar firms. Solanki has stopped taking calls from manufacturers and solar service providers seeking manpower because their slim profit margins put them at risk of financial trouble, he said. Small-scale solar manufacturers and service providers like Solanki are regarded as important players in India's push to achieve a national goal of installing 270 gigawatts (GW) of solar power capacity by 2030 - enough to power about 200 million homes. In an industry driven by government policy, these firms are also key to generating green jobs, with even the smallest hiring at least 25 workers, according to manufacturers' associations. India's micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) - which number about 60 million across all sectors - generate the largest amount of employment after agriculture, and foster entrepreneurship at a lower capital cost than large-scale manufacturing. Yet, despite their role in fostering skills and inclusive growth, many in the solar value chain are floundering as larger companies enter the market, states impose strict tender rules and the government tightens quality controls, imposes mandatory certification for components and ramps up costly on-site checks. These conditions have made it hard for MSMEs to bid effectively for government-backed solar projects from setting up solar-run agricultural pumps to rooftop systems and micro-grids. Once considered pioneers in the business and credited with creating early awareness among consumers, MSMEs are now operating as sub-contractors and sales agents for big companies that are cornering most solar projects across the country. Many like Solanki are either diversifying, shutting down or downsizing - with knock-on effects for employment.  The plot has been lost for MSMEs, with many struggling to retain a foothold in the solar market,  said Gulabsing Girase, director of Gro Solar Energy Private Ltd, a firm he co-founded after leaving the Maharashtra State Power Generation Company. Large players are entering even the rooftop solar market which was dominated by MSMEs until a few years ago, he noted.  Businesses set up by borrowing from family and friends are getting marginalised - and the benefits of the booming solar market are slowly getting consolidated into the hands of a few big companies,  he added. RENEWABLES MANUFACTURING PUSH Now India wants to build up its manufacturing capacity in renewables, with the government launching a scheme in 2021 to increase  made in India  components for clean energy projects to reduce imports and boost self-reliance. It offers tax benefits, subsidies for capital costs and concessions to manufacturers that source raw materials from the domestic market. Under the scheme's second tranche, 11 mid-to-large manufacturers have benefited from government allocations of nearly 40 GW of solar photovoltaic module production, with incentives continuing for five years after new plants are commissioned. The scheme is expected to lead to increased investment and expansion of solar PV manufacturing, as well as a boost to employment, including about 30,000 direct jobs and 120,000 indirect jobs, according to the government. Abhishek Jain, a fellow and director of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), an India-based think-tank, said MSMEs have a big part to play in the energy transition as large firms lack a presence on the ground to execute projects.  But there are challenges smaller companies face - from limited direct interface with the government, to exclusion due to steep tender requirements,  he emphasised. Researchers point out that big companies offer more competitive prices, making clean energy solutions more affordable for customers, and are easier for governments to manage than dealing with many hundreds of smaller players. But, they say, MSMEs could create millions of jobs, boost domestic production of solar components and promote energy security if given financial support and better opportunities to bid for projects such as smaller solar plants and solar pumps in rural areas. GROWTH BENEFITS BIG SOLAR BUSINESSES Rajesh Joshi was an early entrant into the solar market, after spending two months in Spain researching the nuances of the solar industry. The growth of his Rajkot-based company JJ PV Solar, which sets up solar systems and manufactures panels, has been closely linked to India's evolving solar energy policy.  Back in 2009, I had an inkling that renewable energy would be big in the future and invested in it. I made losses for four years, frequented government offices all the time and managed to survive,  he said. His determination was borne out, with solar now making up more than half of India's renewable energy capacity - and Joshi serves as chairman of the Federation of Solar Manufacturers and Intermediaries, representing 150 members. India is working to boost non fossil-fuel sources of power - solar, wind, nuclear, hydro and biomass - to meet a goal of 500 GW of clean energy capacity by 2030, as it looks to reduce its climate-heating emissions by 45% from 2005 levels this decade. Renewable energy minister R. K. Singh told parliament in March that solar projects of nearly 52 GW were under implementation and about 40 GW more were at the tendering stage. Joshi's federation has argued that most of its members will never be able to bid for those projects or have a chance to share in the solar boom. During a recent tender to set up more than 600,000 solar pumps, the pool of bidders was less than 50, he noted, adding that this low level of interest is holding back implementation. MSMEs want the tenders split into smaller contracts, with more concessions for work in rural areas, making it economically viable for them to participate.  So far we have not been successful - we are just outbid,  Joshi said, with many federation members advising people hoping to invest in the solar business to stay away. A senior official at the Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd, the implementing agency for India's National Solar Mission, said MSMEs could enter joint ventures with bigger companies.  Other than the finances, keeping up with the technology changes is also crucial,  said the official, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.  There are issues that need to be addressed but there is a push for MSMEs to grow in the sector,  he added. Both Solanki and Joshi said small enterprises had been efficient and completed projects on time, noting their essential role in driving industry growth.  But if we are not supported with easy access to working capital, we will not survive,  said Solanki, displaying his phone with dozens of messages from solar firms seeking labour.  And if we become sub-contractors for big companies, it will kill our entrepreneurial spirit,  he added. ",

Lenders are appraising the project to evaluate the risk profile and gain confidence in the concepts of green hydrogen and green ammonia,  one bank source said.  Green hydrogen and green ammonia are new concepts and lenders will get confidence when they balance out the risk.  Presently, lenders are charging interest rates ranging from 8.5% to 8.75% for loans in the renewable energy sector.A spokesperson for ACME did not respond to a request for comment.The project will be implemented in phases, with the initial requirement estimated at \u20b94,000 crore.  If a large lender takes the entire exposure, they may subsequently sell a portion of it,  the source said. The loan will be utilised to finance the projects in Tamil Nadu and Oman, with the repayment period aligned with the project's duration.The Tamil Nadu project encompasses the establishment of a 5,000 MW solar PV plant, a 1.5 GW electrolyzer, and a 1.1 million tonne ammonia synthesis loop. ACME Solar has signed a land agreement to establish the green ammonia and green hydrogen facility in Oman, with plans for a $3.5 billion investment.In an interview with ET earlier this year, Rajat Seksaria, CEO of ACME Group, said that the pre-construction work for the Oman project has already commenced, and full-scale construction of the first project is scheduled to begin by April 2024.ACME Solar is actively developing projects in Tamil Nadu and Odisha and has secured an agreement in Karnataka as well. The company is currently in the process of acquiring land in Tamil Nadu and aims to commence construction on 2-3 projects by the end of March.Currently, ACME has solar power projects across 12 states and capex invested and committed at nearly $8 billion. In the past, ACME has undertaken transactions with Actis, Petronas, NIIF, Renew, BAML, Brookfield, Piramal, APG and Allianz, among others. Since 2020, ACME has diversified into green hydrogen and green ammonia. In 2021, ACME commissioned the world's first green hydrogen and green ammonia plant in Bikaner, Rajasthan, according to the company's website. ",

        "articleBody": "Indore: There has been a 75 per cent rise in the number of places using solar panels to generate electricity in the western part of Madhya Pradesh over a period of one year, an official from a power distribution company said on Tuesday. Electricity was being generated from solar panels at 4,900 places in 15 districts of western Madhya Pradesh in May-June last year, while this number has now increased to 8,550, the spokesperson of Madhya Pradesh western Region Power Distribution Company said. At present, solar panels have been installed at 8,550 places, which include hospitals, government offices and other premises, besides residences, he said.  Solar panels of total 110 MW are installed at these locations, from which electricity worth at least Rs 5 crore is being generated every month this summer. The panels are installed on the rooftops of buildings at most places,  the official said. Of these, solar panels of 59 MW capacity have been installed in the premises of low-tension consumers of electricity, while solar panels of 51 MW have been installed for high-tension consumers, he said.  Indore has emerged on top in terms of generating solar power in western Madhya Pradesh, where green energy is being produced in this way in at least 5,100 places, the official said.  Notably, the state government is working on a plan to develop Indore as a  solar city .  The official further said that due to the  net metering system  of generating electricity from solar panels and sending it to the grid, the monthly electricity bill of the concerned consumers has reduced by 30 to 60 per cent.  The state government gives subsidies to the consumers for installing solar panels on their rooftops and they also get loans from banks to install the equipment, he said.",

        "articleBody": "The technology of solar energy generation is becoming more dominant as the world is moving towards net zero carbon emissions, Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy R K Singh said.  With every progressing year, the solar is becoming the more dominant renewable energy generation technology as the world moves towards net zero,  the minister said at the standing committee meeting of the International Solar Alliance.  The eighth meeting of the standing committee of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) was held in New Delhi on June 6, 2023 under the chairpersonship of Singh, in his capacity as the power minister of India, the current president of the ISA, said a statement from the new and renewable energy ministry.  France as co-president of the ISA assembly was the co-chair of the meeting. Some representatives of member countries joined in person, while others joined the meeting online.  The eighth meeting of the ISA standing committee discussed ISA demonstration projects in member countries, Solar Technology Application Resource Centre (STAR-C), ISA SolarX startup challenge, solar finance facility and preparations for the ninth meeting of the ISA standing committee and preparations for the sixth session of the ISA assembly.  Singh said that the need for an energy transition is now a settled question.   Whether the world today needs an energy transition is no longer in question. Rather, the question is how to achieve it, and how soon. A new global energy economy is emerging, with the rapid growth of renewables as the alternative source of energy,  he said.  The minister underlined the crucial role of the development of solar energy in the world's achievement of making the transition to renewable energy.  The development of solar energy is one of the major contributors for achieving energy transition, he said.  The cumulative global solar PV capacity has reached approximately 942 GW since the last decade, he noted.  The solar PV market maintained its record-breaking streak with new capacity installations totalling 175 GW in 2021, he added.  The minister observed that the growth of solar energy is expected to get compounded as solar PV technology finds more applications in the distributed energy space.   Productive use applications of solar PV, agro PV, and flexible and surface integrated solar cells continue to open new avenues for deploying solar PV technology.   The minister stated that the ISA has been striving tirelessly towards global solar energy transition.  He said the challenge to the environment is something which is now becoming more and more urgent and that the time left for humankind to address this challenge is limited.   We cannot address this challenge unless and until we help the least developed countries to get access to clean energy, to make the energy transition. This has been recognised decades back, but we have not seen any conclusions coming forward. For the world to get to net zero, it will not happen by just a few countries getting to net zero. We need to ask our conscience whether we are doing enough.   The minister told member countries that while some green funds have been set up across the world, ISA needs to ask those green funds to channel some of those funds to African countries. The contribution to the green funds also needs to go up, he added.  The ISA is a collaborative platform for increased deployment of solar energy technologies to ensure energy security and driving energy transition in its member countries.  It is an international organisation with 93 member countries and 115 signatory countries and is the first intergovernmental organisation to be headquartered in India.",

        "articleBody": "The world is set to add a record amount of renewable electricity capacity this year as governments and consumers seek to offset high energy prices and take advantage of a boom in solar power, according to a new report on Thursday. The International Energy Agency said high fossil fuel prices - resulting from Russia's attack on Ukraine - and concerns about energy security had boosted the rollout of solar and wind power installations, which are expected to reach 440 gigawatts in 2023.  That's about a third more than the world added the previous year, taking the global installed capacity to 4,500 GW, roughly the combined total power output of the United States and China combined, the Paris-based agency said.   The global energy crisis has shown renewables are critical for making energy supplies not just cleaner but also more secure and affordable,  said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director.   Governments are responding with efforts to deploy them faster,  he said. Recent incentives to install renewables introduced by the Biden administration are already driving a significant uptake in the United States.  About two-thirds of this year's increase in renewable power capacity will come from photovoltaic, with both large-scale solar farms and consumer rooftop installations seeing significant growth.  IEA said manufacturing capacity for PV components was also surging, especially in China.  But Birol cautioned that power grids must be upgraded and expanded to cope with the intermittent nature of solar and wind power, which requires a fundamentally different approach by network operators compared with existing coal, gas or nuclear plants.  Shifting the global economy away from fossil fuels is one of the most important steps for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.  Experts say that to meet the Paris climate accord's goal of limiting temperature rise since pre-industrial times to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), emissions need to be halved by 2030 and cut to  net zero  by mid-century.  The International Renewable Energy Agency, a separate body, has called for a major increase in wind and solar investments. Nations are expected to discuss setting an international target for the rollout of renewable energy at this year's UN climate summit in Dubai. (AP) PY PY",

        "articleBody": "Germany-based silicon wafer manufacturer NexWafe GmbH (NexWafe) has raised \u20ac30M (Rs 265 crore plus) from a consortium of its current group of investors-- Reliance New Energy Limited, Aramco Ventures and Athos Venture GmbH-- as well as new investors, including Malcolm Turnbull AC and Keshik Capital, led by Alex Turnbull.The funds will be used to accelerate the construction of NexWafe's first commercial-scale facility in Bitterfeld, Germany to fabricate the company\u2019s green solar wafers, NexWafe said in a statement. Davor Sutija, CEO, NexWafe, said: \u201cThis investment marks the start of NexWafe\u2019s plan to raise substantially larger funds in the second half of 2023. The funds will be used to break ground on NexWafe\u2019s first commercial facility to speed the renewable energy transition with more efficient, lower cost, green solar wafers for the world\u2019s photovoltaic manufacturers.\u201d In 2021, Reliance Industries through its wholly owned subsidiary Reliance New Energy Limited, had invested $29 million as a strategic lead investor in NexWafe's Series C financing round.Parallely, NexWafe will work with Aramco Ventures on a future green solar wafer manufacturing facility in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The collaborative agreement will include participation from the firm\u2019s $1.5 billion Sustainability fund.In a press statement, NexWafe said its unique, patented green solar wafer manufacturing solution simplifies polysilicon production and reduces energy use and production time. This results in drastically lowered production costs for n-type monocrystalline wafers used for the majority of high-performing solar modules.The company\u2019s novel manufacturing method delivers wafers that are engineered to the requirements of each customer and already achieving parity with commercially available Czochralski (CZ) wafers. Providing an opportunity to optimize the performance of a chosen cell design enables solar cell makers to ultimately deliver higher efficiencies. NexWafe\u2019s process supports urgent U.S. and European efforts to re-shore domestic solar wafer manufacturing and cell production by increasing supply-chain sourcing diversity and resilience. The NexWafe process also reduces CO2 emissions, resulting in a solar-energy supply chain that is genuinely green,  the company added.",

        "articleBody": "India may cut its import taxes on solar panels in half and is seeking a rollback in goods and services taxes on the devices to make up a shortfall in local output amid rising demand for renewable energy, three government sources said. India's renewable energy ministry has held talks with the finance ministry to approve its request to cut the import tax on solar panels from 40% to 20%, said the three sources, who declined to be identified as the decision has not yet been finalised. Also, the two ministries may make a recommendation to India's Good and Services Tax Council to lower the goods and services tax (GST) on solar panels to 5%, from the 12% imposed in 2021, the sources said. India imposed the 40% solar panel import tax in April 2022 and a 25% tax on solar cells to discourage Chinese imports, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious plan to become more self-reliant and cut emissions by scaling up renewable energy generation.  However, domestic capacity is falling short ... imports are required to fill in the gap,  said one of the sources. The proposal comes as Modi looks at achieving a target of 365 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar capacity by 2031-32, part of a green energy push that extends from promoting electric cars to sustainable aviation fuel. India's finance ministry did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. A spokesperson for the renewable energy ministry said a comment would be made as soon as possible.",

        "articleBody": "The solar capacity addition in India fell by 48 per cent yea-on-year to 1.9 GW in January-March period of 2023, according to Mercom India Research. The country had added 3.6 gigawatt (GW) of solar capacity during the same period in 2022, the research firm said in its latest report.   India added 1.9 GW of solar capacity in the first quarter of calendar year 2023, a 48 per cent decrease year-over-year (YoY) compared to the 3.6 GW added in Q1 2022,  the report titled 'Q1 2023 India Solar Market Update' said.  On a quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) basis, the installations were 30 per cent lower compared to the 2.7 GW solar capacity installed in October-December period or fourth quarter in 2022.  Out of 1.9 GW, large-scale solar projects accounted for 74 per cent of installations, with rooftop solar making up an additional 26 per cent.  India's cumulative installed solar capacity currently stands at 64.5 GW. As of March 2023, the country's utility-scale project development pipeline stood at 58 GW, with an additional 58 GW of projects tendered awaiting auction.  India's solar industry passed an important milestone in 2022, setting a new record with 13 GW of capacity added. However, in 2023 the additions are expected to be lower as commissioning deadlines for several projects have been moved to next year. Besides, a number of projects are facing delays due to land and transmission issues, Mercom India said.   The market is re-calibrating following the ALMM decision by the government. Project extensions, GIB, and infrastructure issues point to a softer year than predicted.   On a positive note, module prices are trending in the right direction, and project costs declined for the first time after rising for ten consecutive quarters, bringing much needed relief to the solar industry,  Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group, said.  The government earlier extended the ALMM by one year till March 2024 amid industry raising concerns over raw material availability and supply chain.  The Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) was introduced to boost domestic manufacturing.",

        "articleSection": "Industry",
        "articleBody": "In the searing heat that often envelops Raichur, an ancient town in southern India, a ceiling fan that spins without interruption brings sweet relief for the newborn babies and their mothers at the Government Maternity Hospital. But such respite wasn't always guaranteed in a region where frequent power cuts to India's overmatched electrical grid can last hours. It wasn't until the hospital installed rooftop solar panels a year ago that it could depend on constant electricity that keeps the lights on, patients and staff comfortable and vaccines and medicines safely refrigerated. The diesel generator that used to provide emergency backup - spewing planet-warming gases and toxic smoke within breathing distance of newborns every time it was running - is gone. So is the need to use flashlights to see during one of the hospital's roughly 600 births per year, as staff sometimes had to do amid a sudden blackout if the old generators weren't working. For Martha Jones, a senior nurse who has helped deliver countless babies, the reliability that solar has brought has been a revelation.  We don't even know when power is cut or when it has come back,  Jones said. In semi-urban and rural regions of India and other developing countries with unreliable power grids, decentralized renewable energy - especially solar - is making all the difference in delivering modern health care. And it's becoming even more indispensable where heat and weather extremes are increasing due to climate change. In Raichur, for example, temperatures can soar to 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit) in the warmest months. The hospital, Government Maternity, a bare-bones facility that serves thousands who can't afford private health care, is one of 251 medical facilities in the Raichur district that runs on rooftop solar under a program spearheaded by Selco Foundation. The Bengaluru-based not-for-profit has raised funds from Indian and international corporations and coordinated with the local government since 2017. It costs about $8,500 to install a system at public health care centers, including lead-acid batteries that store power for use at night. Smaller clinics run closer to about $2,000. The sites remain connected to the power grid, but only as a backup to the solar. Some of Government Maternity's patients, like 25-year-old Sandhya Shivappa, said they knew little or nothing about the hospital's use of solar power and were simply grateful for its free services.  We would be paying 30,000 rupees ($367) if I wanted to deliver my baby at a private hospital,  said Sandhya Shivappa, a 25-year-old who had just delivered a healthy baby girl when a reporter visited. Shifting the hospitals and clinics to clean energy helps cut emissions in a sector that accounts for about 4.4% of the global figure, according to a study by Health Care Without Harm, an international nonprofit that advocates to reduce that. And that fits broader goals in India, the world's most populous nation and the third-largest emitter of planet-warming gases.  While India currently relies heavily on coal for its electricity, it has a target of installing 450 gigawatts of renewable energy that should account for about half its needs by the end of this decade. Rapid increase in solar, especially rooftop solar, will be necessary to meet that goal.  India has currently only installed about one-fourth of the 40 gigawatts of rooftop solar that policymakers had planned to have by last year. Supply chain issues and taxes on imported components - intended to protect domestic makers - have contributed to that shortfall. But India has also constantly reiterated the importance of getting money from developed countries and multilateral development banks to help achieve its climate goals. Besides providing uninterrupted power, the rooftop solar is helping the medical facilities cut costs. In nearby Zaheerabad, a low-income neighborhood, Dr. Kavyashree Sugur said the public health center she oversees has paid at least 50% less for electricity in the two years since installing solar panels. That's a big benefit in a country that is among the lowest spenders on health care in the world - India spends just a little more than 2% of its national budget on health care, compared to the United States' 18% - and many hospitals and health clinics are cash-strapped. The addition of solar to health care centers in remote regions has been especially important for villagers who don't have the time or money to visit hospitals in the city, and likely would have simply gone without health care, said Hanumantappa Channadaser, Selco's branch manager in Raichur.  Before solar, people were apprehensive to visit these hospitals because of power shortages and they didn't have faith in the treatment they might get,  Channadaser said. Recently, Selco, the Ikea Foundation and the Indian health ministry announced that they will set up solar power for 25,000 government health care facilities across 12 Indian states by 2026. Ikea has committed $48 million to the project. Selco is also working with the International Renewable Energy Agency and World Health Organization in Africa to scale up decentralized solar for health facilities on that continent.  Shireen Fatima, who was four months pregnant and visiting the Zaheerabad health care center for a checkup, said she appreciates how  blood tests, tablets, everything is free here.  The hospital's shift to solar energy is  definitely good,  she added.  If the hospital is saving on bills, the benefits will be for us too,  she said.",

        "articleBody": "Investment in solar power is expected to overtake oil for the first time this year as clean energy spending outpaces that for fossil fuels, the IEA said in a report Thursday.While that is a welcome development, the International Energy Agency warned that investment in fossil fuels is rising when it should be falling fast to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Clean energy is moving fast -- faster than many people realise,  IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement accompanying the release of the agency's latest report on energy investment. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels,  he added.Annual investment in clean energy is expected to have risen by 24 percent from 2021 to more than $1.7 trillion in 2023, according to the IEA. The gain for fossil fuels was 15 percent over the same period.Investment in clean energy and fossil fuels was equal only five years ago. But a combination of factors, in particular high oil and gas prices and a worry about supplies, has seen spending on renewables surge ahead. One shining example is investment in solar, which is set to overtake the amount of investment going into oil production for the first time,  Birol said.The IEA expects investment in solar power, essentially photovoltaic panels, to hit $380 billion this year, while investment in oil exploration and extraction should come in at $370 billion.Sun King -  This crowns solar as a true energy superpower,  said Dave Jones, head of data insights at the energy think tank Ember.The low price of solar power generation will help propel decarbonisation efforts as electric car adoption gathers pace.But the rebound in oil and gas investment, which is expected to return to 2019 levels this year, puts the industry further away from the IEA's 2050 net zero trajectory.The IEA says overall 2023 fossil fuel investment is expected to be more than double the amount the sector should be spending in 2030. For coal, it cold hit six times the amount.The IEA also noted that clean energy investment was concentrated in advanced nations and China, while the biggest increases in fossil fuel investment are in Middle Eastern nations. The irony remains that some of the sunniest places in the world have the lowest levels of solar investment, and this is a problem that needs attention,  said Jones.The IEA also found that major energy companies, for the most part, are not putting considerable funds into the transition to green energy.Just five percent of their cash flow last year went to low-carbon and renewable energies or carbon capture projects, only about a quarter of the amount that was paid out overall to shareholders.",

The fundraising is aimed at tying up the financial requirements for its \u20b98,000-crore capex plan which will see Waaree set up 6-GW (gigawatts) of manufacturing capacity each for solar module, cells, and ingots and wafers under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme,  one of the sources said.  The company has already received commitments worth around \u20b9600 crore. The promoter group will invest around \u20b9200 crore in this round,  the person said.The new fundraising round comes just six months after the company raised \u20b91,000 crore from HNIs and family offices in an equity round led by ValueQuest Investment Advisors with more than \u20b9500-crore investment. Ravi Dharamshi, MD of ValueQuest, said the investment firm is looking to lead this funding round as well, coming ahead of Waaree's initial public offering (IPO).100312892In an email response to ET's queries, Dharamshi said Waaree is looking to raise funds for the greenfield project through a  combination of private placement as well as IPO .  The company has initiated the process for the same,  he added. ValueQuest had picked up around 10% stake in Waaree in the last round, one of the sources said. Waaree currently has the biggest solar panel/module manufacturing footprint in the country with 9 GW capacity. Its latest capex plan is expected to be complete by FY26, said the person quoted first. The company is currently in the process of setting up a cell manufacturing capacity of 5.4 GW and is also expanding its module manufacturing capacity to 12 GW from 9 GW, the person added. Dharamshi said Waaree is the leading solar module manufacturer in India with more than 20% market share.  It is also the topmost exporter from India with 70% market share. Waaree Energies order book has seen a jump from $1 billion to $5 billion in last 12 months,  he said. The company had first filed for an IPO in September 2021 but did not go ahead with the plans.  Waaree has been able to attract strong interest from HNIs and family offices for the fundraise as the company has been able to take advantage of US import curbs on certain Chinese goods which impact imports of solar modules,  said the second source cited above.  The company has reported strong financials, ending FY23 with an Ebitda of over \u20b9850 crore and it projects its Ebitda to double in FY24.  ",

        "articleBody": "Union Power Minister RK Singh on Wednesday said the government will bring a scheme for promoting distributed solar and wind energy applications. Distributed solar or wind energy is not connected to the grid and provides power supply generated through these clean sources in a particular area. Grid-scale solar and wind energy are connected with the inter-state power transmission system.  We came out with a scheme for solar street lights, rooftop solar...we need to expand this scheme...we are coming out with a new scheme for distributed (solar, wind) applications. That means we want to expand this,  Singh said while addressing the National Summit on Powering Sustainable Livelihoods' here organised by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and Villgro Innovations Foundation's Powering Livelihoods initiative. The minister explained that there is already a lot of work happening on the ground and the new scheme could benefit lakhs of families across the country.  We will, however, need large scale-manufacturing and standardising of distributed applications of renewable energy to lower prices and expand the sector. We have seen the potential of grid-scale solar power. India will scale up distributed applications of renewable energy for livelihoods,  he said. Just like India has a large programme on rooftop solar and solar irrigation, the country will create a large programme for DRE (distributed renewable energy) livelihoods, the minister explained. The minister also said that the peak power demand touched a record level of 221 GW on Wednesday. The minister said that  today, the (power) demand touched 221GW. That is the largest level (of power demand). The (power) demand has been growing at 10 per cent. Last year, it was eight per cent. This year it is 10 per cent. No other country has electricity demand growing at such a rate . He told that 82,000 MW of renewable energy and 50,000 MW of thermal power generation capacity is under construction. Besides, he said India has 14,000 MW of hydropower generation capacity under construction.  The government plans to make DRE livelihood equipment affordable. One aspect of this will be tying up with banks. If a family wants to own a solar dryer, they should be able to get financing from the banks - we will work towards it. Manufacturers and users of DRE for livelihoods are pioneers and now the government will scale it up to the next level,  the minister said. Singh released two new reports by CEEW and Villgro, which show that clean technologies have the potential to impact 37 million livelihoods in India's agriculture and textile sectors and translate into a market opportunity worth almost Rs four lakh crore (about USD 50 billion). Further, 70 per cent of women and farmers using clean technology reported an income increase, typically by 35 per cent. They use clean-energy powered products, such as solar-powered silk reeling machines, multi-food processors, micro solar pumps, and solar vertical fodder grow units, among others, to enhance and diversify their income. Singh also launched 'Suraj ka Gola' -- a solar anthem produced by CEEW and Villgro. The reports found that clean-tech-powered technologies have the greatest impact opportunity in Uttar Pradesh, followed by West Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. But the relative market for each livelihood technology varies across states. For example, micro solar pumps have the highest market in West Bengal, whereas solar dryers have the highest market in Maharashtra. Further, the CEEW-Villgro analysis highlighted that women form the majority of these clean tech users currently. Out of the 767 users surveyed across 19 states, 74 per cent of respondents were women. The clean technologies deployed brought out several social impacts as well.",

        "articleBody": "Jammu and Kashmir Energy Development Agency (JAKEDA) has launched a new scheme under which consumers can reduce their electricity bills and bank their surplus energy if they install solar power plants in their homes.  We have a 20-Megawatt 'Roof Top Solar Power Plant' project for Jammu and Kashmir. In this scheme we are trying to cover 10,000 households, where we set up a power plant of three, five or ten-kilowatt capacity that will curtail the electricity bills of the consumers,  JAKEDA Chief Executive Officer Prithvi Raj Dhar told PTI. Dhar, who inaugurated a solar power expo here on Wednesday, said with the installation of smart meters, which are bidirectional, the energy generated from the solar panels installed at the premises of consumers will be transferred to the grid.  The number of units generated by the solar plant will be deducted from the number of units consumed by the consumer,  he added.  It means the cost of installing the plant will be recovered in three years and the consumer will get free energy for the rest of his life. It is also clean energy. Installing one KW solar power plant is equivalent to planting 66 trees per year. This will greatly reduce carbon emissions,  Dhar said. JAKEDA Assistant Executive Engineer Khalid Raja said in the case of consumers using less energy than what is generated by their plant, the excess energy will be banked in their account for later use.  The government is providing subsidies on setting up the power plant which is up to 65 per cent of project cost. The consumer has to provide only 35 per cent,  he added. Afshan Reshi, a visitor at the expo, was upbeat about the new scheme.  There are a lot of benefits. It will reduce the electricity bills. Right now there is a good amount of subsidy on it. It may be reduced later or waived later,  Reshi said. JAKEDA has invited several companies which manufacture and market solar technologies to the expo so that the visitors can choose from a wide range of products.",

The seller of the units of VRET being Terra Asia Holdings II Pte. Ltd. (Terra), is controlled and/or managed and/or advised, solely by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or by its affiliates (together, the KKR Group), along with one of the IndiGrid sponsors, and is a related party of IndiGrid.  The Virescent was established in 2020 to acquire renewable energy assets in India against the backdrop of the country's rapidly growing renewable energy demands.  Since its launch, Virescent has scaled to a portfolio of 16 operating solar projects totaling 538 MWp of capacity with an AUM (asset under management) of Rs 4,121 crore as of March 31, 2023.  In September 2021, Virescent became India's first privately listed renewables-focused InvIT. Recently, it announced its 6th acquisition which will bring its total capacity to 563 MWp upon completion.  Set up in 2016, IndiGrid is India's first and largest InvIT in the power transmission sector. It owns, operates, and manages transmission networks and renewable energy assets that deliver reliable power.  Today, it owns 17 power projects with transmission lines of more than 8,468 ckms, 13 substations with 17,550 MVA transformation capacity, and 100 MWAC of solar generation capacity.  Virescent is the India's only renewables-focused entity with a dual  AAA  credit rating in India.

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Finnish energy company Fortum plans to sell its operational assets in India -185 MW of solar projects spread across Rajasthan, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.Kotak Mahindra Capital has been mandated to find buyers for the assets.Fortum is targeting an enterprise value of Rs 1,600 crore ($200 million) for the assets, said two people aware of the development. Feelers were sent to global funds and domestic energy producers, they said.The assets comprise a 100 MW solar project at the Pavagada Solar Park in Karnataka, two projects of 70 MW and 5 MW in Rajasthan and another 10 MW facility in Madhya Pradesh.At present, these operational assets are jointly owned by Fortum, Macquarie Group-backed UK Climate Investments and Finland-based asset management firm Elite Alfred Berg. UK Climate Investments (which owns 40%) and Elite Alfred Berg (14%) bought the stakes from Fortum in 2018.99740815A Fortum spokesperson declined to comment, while an email sent to UK Climate Investments did not elicit any responses till press time on Monday.Since 2013, Fortum has developed and constructed about 1 GW of solar power in India. Over time, a majority of this capacity has been divested to enable further investments with a limited equity exposure, in line with the build-operate-transfer business model. In one of the deals, Fortum in 2021 sold its 250 MW Pavagada II and 250 MW Rajasthan solar power plants to Actis for about \u20b9280 million.At present, Fortum has a pipeline of 1 GW in India. Recently, it has won the rights to build a 200 MW solar project in Gujarat under a 25-year power purchase agreement with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam at a fixed tariff of '2.29/kWh. The project will be commissioned by 2024.Last year, Fortum won the right from Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to build two solar power parks with a total capacity of 600 MW in Karnataka. These are also expected to be commissioned by 2024.Besides expanding its solar power generation, Fortum is aggressively exploring opportunities in the electric vehicle charging space in India. Fortum Charge & Drive, a pioneer in electric vehicle charging, has partnered with MG Motor and Carzonrent to set up charging points for electric cars across the country. Only 41% of projects awarded by the SECI during fiscal years 2018-21 got commissioned till December 2022. As much as 23% of the projects were cancelled while the remaining are delayed due to issues in land acquisition, and evacuation and supply-side constraints, said a recent Crisil report.India has pledged to install 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, which is the world's largest renewable energy expansion programme, to meet its commitments related to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.",

        "articleBody": "India will require to add 30 gigawatt (GW) of solar energy capacity annually to meet the 280 GW solar capacity installation target by 2030, according to US-based Mercom Capital. Sharing his outlook, Mercom Capital CEO Raj Prabhu said,  The outlook is very positive on the back of various steps taken by the government to help and support the domestic renewable energy sector . The government launched production-linked incentive programmes, renewable manufacturing zones and a few other initiatives to make India Atmanirbhar in this area. However, policy certainty and timely implementation of these programmes are critical for achieving the government's goal of self-reliance in renewable energy, he noted.  We must change our mindset from a 10 GW a year industry to a 30 GW a year solar industry and establish all the necessary infrastructure - physical, policy and financial to achieve the 280 GW goal (solar capacity installation) along with the energy transition goals,  he said. He further said the overall renewable energy sector remains a bright spot for investors as foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow is showing an upward trend. The FDI flow in April-December FY23 was at USD 1.66 billion was higher than the USD 1.60 billion attracted in the entire FY22, he said. India's total installed renewable energy capacity touched the 168.96 GW mark by February 2023-end, Minister for New and Renewable Energy RK Singh informed Parliament last month. Out of the total 168.96 GW, 64.38 GW is solar power capacity, 51.79 GW hydro, 42.02 GW wind and 10.77 GW biopower, he informed the Rajya Sabha. Another 82.62 GW of green energy capacity is under implementation and 40.89 GW of capacity is under various stages of tendering, he said in a written reply to the upper House. A total of 3,16,754.86 MU of electricity has been generated from renewable energy sources during the current year 2022-23 (up to January 2023), Singh said. According to the minister, India's total power generation capacity was at 412.21 GW as of February 28, 2023. The government's aim is to achieve 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030.",

This has the potential to make Rajasthan a highly preferred destination for solar energy at the global level,  Anirudh Saraswat, Co-founder & Chief Business Officer, Oriana Power, said. This is the fifth project by Oriana Power in the state, following the completion of 1 MWp Hindustan Copper Limited, Khetri, 1 MWp, Hindustan Salt Limited, Nawa, 4.35 MWp, Udaipur Cement Limited Udaipur and 8 MWp, JK Laxmi Cement Limited, Sirohi projects in the past couple of years.

They will now conduct due diligence on the company before they submit firm financial offers, according to sources.The others that submitted non-binding offers were Statkraft, iSquared Capital and a consortium involving an investment firm, which could not be identified. Eversource Capital and JSW Neo Energy's non-binding offers are said to be higher.Continuum Green Energy is 83% owned by Morgan Stanley. Founders own the remaining stake. Continuum chief executive officer Arvind Bansal was unavailable for comment. Eversource Capital and JSW Neo Energy declined to comment. 99594642 It's not certain a transaction will take place,  said an executive familiar with the stake-sale process.This is the third time that Morgan Stanley has initiated a formal process to sell its stake in the Mumbai-headquartered green energy producer founded by IIM Ahmedabad classmates Arvind Bansal and Vikash Saraf in 2009. Citi is advising on the stake sale.JSW Neo Energy is a subsidiary of the listed JSW Energy, which has been set up for the company's green energy expansion. Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Energy is aiming to build a 10 GW electricity generation business by 2025. Of this, 65% will be electricity generated through renewable energy sources such as wind and sunlight. It acquired the green energy business of Mytrah Energy for an enterprise value of Rs. 11,934 crore in August.Eversource Capital is fund manager of a green growth equity fund established with anchor investments from India's National Infrastructure and Investment Fund (NIIF) and the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and development office (FCDO).In the past, US-based Sun Edison group and Statkraft came close to acquiring the company in independently run processes but both attempts failed.Continuum Green Energy has ramped up its portfolio of operating wind and solar power plants. It has operating power plants that produce over 1 gigawatt of electricity. It also has projects with an energy producing capacity of 2.5 GW in the pipeline.It owns and operates India's largest, 226.8 MW wind-solar, co-located hybrid project in Tamil Nadu and is in the process of building a similar 250 MW wind-solar hybrid project in Gujarat.Sun Edison had attempted an acquisition of the company in 2016 but that fell through because it was unable to close the deal. Sun Edison filed for bankruptcy in the US the same year. Norway's Statkraft held discussions to acquire Continuum Energy in 2019, but a deal did not materialise.North Haven Infrastructure Partners, a global infrastructure fund managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, invested $212 million in Continuum Energy in 2012.",

        "articleBody": "\u2018AgriPV\u2019 or \u2018agrivoltaics\u2019 that is combining agriculture with photovoltaics (PV) to optimise land usage has gained traction in countries such as Germany, Japan and Italy and is being actively explored in India. As India explores agriPV in its quest to meet its 2030 targets and decarbonise its economy, it is crucial to address the fundamental question: What is agriPV (agriculture and photovoltaics) in the Indian context?Clarity in definitions is critical if the transition to low carbon pathways and a net zero is to be achieved. Making the defining of agriculture and photovoltaics (agriPV) in the Indian context crucial. There are more than 55 major crops grown across the subcontinent in varying climatic and soil conditions. It is likely that most of these crops will show varying trends when combined with photovoltaics. India is still an agrarian economy; agriculture contributes approximately 17% to its gross domestic product. In the last financial year, agricultural exports crossed $50 billion, whereas imports tallied to ~$32.5 billion. Therefore, any changes in agricultural production resulting from the introduction of PV will have profound consequences for India\u2019s overall economy.To understand the complex issue of agriPV definition, we take wheat as an example. Wheat is one of the most important staple crops in India. It ranks 2nd (after rice) in terms of area under cultivation (~33 million hectares) and production (~110 million tonnes). Despite consuming ~103 million tonnes internally, wheat exports raked in more than $2 billion last year. India produces ~13% of the world\u2019s wheat and is expected to increase production and exports. However, unpredicted heatwaves in April 2022 led to experts believing that production could drop to below 100 million tonnes for 2022\u201323. The recent Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict further highlighted the volatile nature and prices of wheat as a commodity. These supply shortages, global dynamics, and domestic price surges forced the government to intervene and prevent exports.Co-locating PV with wheat is bound to add to the plethora of variables associated with production. Wheat is grown across India, and there are more than 440 notified varieties. Each one has been developed over time, considering local climatic conditions and soil characteristics. PV panels installed at a height to allow farming and tractor movements below change the microclimatic conditions of a farm. Parameters such as soil and ambient temperatures, humidity below panels, and incident radiation that determine plant growth are affected. Wheat varieties will react differently in terms of yield and maturing time frames because of the impacts of PV. For example, a farmer growing Lokwan wheat in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, produces ~18 quintals/acre. With elevated PV, this yield might increase to ~20 quintals/acre. On the other hand, a farmer growing Sharbati wheat in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, for exports might witness reduced yield from ~18 quintals/acre to ~16 quintals/acre. These subtle changes might seem innocuous at the farm level. However, they have far-reaching consequences in terms of economics when the millions of acres under cultivation are considered.Moreover, wheat is grown typically only as a rabi/winter crop in India. Crop rotation for other seasons and years includes legumes, mustard, and sometimes even rice. The productivity variations of these crops because of PV installations need to be assessed. Changes in productivity and linkages to economics (foreign trade, domestic demand, and commodity prices) need to be analysed in detail. Compensation amounts (for farmers losing revenue because of crop yield reduction) need to be quantified. Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) might need to be adjusted on a regional basis. Lessons learnt from pilots in other countries will not apply to Indian wheat growing practices. Hence, it is imperative to generate primary data in the Indian context.This food\u2013energy nexus and overall macroeconomic linkages with national interests are applicable to all major crops. Population is slated to grow by 300 million in the next decade along with exponential growth in the demand for food grains. In the same time frame, India has announced that >200 GW of additional solar PV capacity will be installed. While agriPV is expected to contribute significantly to this, it should not come at undue costs to food production and the country\u2019s economy.Similar to wheat, multiple pilots for major food crops across the country need to be set up. Agricultural universities, research institutes, think tanks, international experts, developers, farmers/farmer producer organisations and state/central governments need to collaborate and gather findings. Thorough analyses in terms of deviation from the baseline need to be conducted for each crop of interest. This includes agricultural yield, microclimate, soil conditions, farmer income/compensation, local/national/international economics and trade dynamics, and PV plant performance.Germany, after several rounds of deliberation among stakeholders, arrived at a definition of agriPV that restricts yield reduction to a maximum of 33%. In Japan, this number is 20%. Guidelines in France recommend no yield loss whatsoever, whereas in Italy, the loss of arable land because of agriPV is limited to 20%. India needs to arrive at acceptable numbers for these criteria to define agriPV classifications for each major crop in each state. Only reliable and concrete data can resolve conflicts debated among all involved stakeholders for crops with reduced yield or reduction in arable area. However, there are crops such as tomatoes, leafy greens, herbs, and tubers that thrive under shaded conditions. India\u2019s agriPV journey can start with these crops and evolve over time with primary data-driven definitions and classifications for other major crops.The author is a senior policy specialist in the energy and power sector at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), a research-based think tank.",

The statement assumes significance amid the US approving an Inflation Reduction Act to establish green technology industries and the EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which is a global carbon tax levied on imports to the bloc.India also expressed concerns at efforts on evolving regulation relating to ban on import of products based on determination of deforestation in the country of origin by the importing member as they would increase compliance burdens and generate further revenue streams for designated verification and certification agencies.Fiorino highlighted that the costs of critical minerals needs to be lowered to reduce the cost of battery manufacturing, which is key for the global electric mobility story.(The journalist is in Washington on the invitation of the East West Center)",

Sri Lankan Cabinet has given approval for the project as the country aims to generate 70 per cent of its electricity requirement by 2030 from renewable energy sources.   The National Thermal Power Corporation of India and the Ceylon Electricity Board have entered into an agreement to jointly implement a solar power project in two stages,  said a note from the Cabinet meeting held this week.   As the first stage of this project, it is expected to implement a solar power project of 50 megawatts with a total estimated investment of USD 42.5 million and to construct a 220 kilowatts transmission line with 40-km length from Sampoor to Kappalthure spending USD 23.6 million. It is expected to complete this stage in two years from 2024 to 2025,  it said.  A solar power generation plant with an additional 85 megawatts is expected to be constructed under a total investment of USD 72 million at the second stage of this project, the note said.  The Indian government has expressed willingness to promote and strengthen cooperation in the renewable energy sector by operating and facilitating power generation projects utilising solar and wind power, including coastal wind and biomass, it said.  India will also provide continuous transmission of infrastructure in places where agreed mutually in Sri Lanka including the northern and eastern provinces in cooperation with private and state entrepreneurs in India and Sri Lanka, the note said.  A 2013 agreement with NTPC to build a thermal power plant in Sampur was later abandoned over objections to the environmental hazards of using coal for power generation.",

Considering the two tranches together, the total domestic solar PV module manufacturing capacity allocated under the PLI Scheme is 48,337 MW, with a cumulative support of more than Rs. 18,500 crore by the government. The PLI Scheme has proved to be a watershed event in India's Renewable landscape resulting in around 48 GW domestic module manufacturing capacity within next 3 years. Scheme has boosted Government's efforts to reduce not only the impact of global supply chain shocks but also our import dependence adhering to the Hon'ble Prime Minister's vision of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat,  said R. K. Singh, Union Minister for Power & NRE.He said that India was well on its way to climb up the value chain in production of the high technology Solar PV Modules and the recent capacity addition is a major step towards making India Aatmanirbhar in solar manufacturing sector.",

The percentage of projects that reached P90 level of generation rose, with 75% reporting achieving P90 in the current financial year compared with 59% over the previous 12 months. The P90 generation estimate predicts how much energy is generated with 90% confidence over the course of the solar project's lifespan, enabling investors to assess cash flow and account for fluctuations in generation.",

        "articleSection": "Industry",
        "articleBody": "Longer sunnier days have ensured that the performance of solar power farms improved to 75 per cent in the current fiscal from 59 per cent in the year-ago period, according to a report. Rating agency Crisil has prepared the report based on the performance of 115 solar projects aggregating to 4.6 GW of power generation and those having an operational record of at least one full year.  As per the report, 75 per cent of these projects reached P90 level of generation in the current financial year compared to only 59 per cent in the year-ago period.  P90 generation estimate indicates generation that is likely to happen with 90 per cent confidence during the project's tenure annually. For example, a P90 value of 10,000 kWh for the annual output implies that it will generate over 10,000 kWh power for 90 per cent of the time.  The performance on the P90 metric is crucial as it is used widely to estimate the cash flow cushion available for debt servicing.  A project's future cash flow are estimated at generation corresponding to the P90 level of confidence to appropriately account for volatility in solar irradiation, the agency said.  Power generation that is 1 percentage point lower than P90 level reduces debt servicing cushion by 15 per cent and lowers return on equity by 1.5-2 percentage points, it added.  Manish Gupta, a senior director at the agency, said that though an estimated 25 per cent of the projects are expected to under perform this fiscal, their median ratings are largely unaffected as 55 per cent of them had generation that was just 0-1 per cent below their P90 level and another 20 per cent fell short by 1-1.5 per cent. The performance is expected to recover over the medium term, according to Ankit Hakhu, a director with the agency.  For instance, 2015-17 were good years with irradiation levels 2-5 per cent higher than average, followed by weaker levels in 2018-20.  Two-thirds of the underperforming projects did so because of lower irradiation. Hence, as irradiation levels improve, the performance of these projects should also recover towards expected levels, he added.  According to the report, improvement in irradiation is weather-induced and remains crucial. A longer period of dwindling irradiation can reduce confidence in cash flows, and thus curtail interest from debt and equity investors alike.  Average irradiation levels are typically 2-4 per cent higher than P90 level of irradiation expectation. It is measured as energy received at a particular project site.",

        "articleBody": "The performance of solar power turned sunnier this fiscal, with 75% of the projects expected to exceed their P90 level of generation, compared with only 59% last fiscal, according to Crisil Ratings. The metric however, still indicates underperformance as 25% did not meet their P90 level.\u201cThough an estimated 25% of the projects are expected to underperform this fiscal, their median ratings are largely unaffected as 55% of these had generation just 0-1% below their P90 level (at which they were modelled) and another 20% fell short by 1-1.5%,  said Says Manish Gupta, Senior Director, Crisil Ratings.Annual P90 generation estimate indicates the generation that is likely to happen with 90% confidence during the project\u2019s tenure, every year. For instance, a P90 value of 10,000 kWh for the annual output of a solar power unit implies it will generate over 10,000 kWh 90% of the time.Gupta added that this level of underperformance reduces the debt-servicing cushion, but cushion but does not impair debt-servicing capability.  This is because generation is dependent on levels of irradiation, which are volatile, and hence, debt servicing levels of projects typically have cushions to absorb such variation,  Gupta said.A study of 115 solar projects aggregating 4.6 gigawatt (GW), with an operational record of at least one full year to eliminate performance volatility during the stabilisation phase, indicates as much.The performance on the P90 metric is crucial as it is used widely to estimate the cash-flow cushion available for debt servicing. A project\u2019s future cash flows are estimated at generation corresponding to the P90 level of confidence to appropriately account for volatility in solar irradiation.Thus, a material and continuous underperformance with respect to P90 may result in lower-than-expected cushion for debt servicing. Generation that is 1 percentage point lower than P90 level reduces debt servicing cushion by 15% and lowers return on equity by 1.5-2.0 percentage points.Further the performances are expected to recover over the medium term.\u201cIrradiation levels are expected to be mean-reverting. There have been cycles of weaker years and better years compared with long-term averages earlier as well,  said Ankit Hakhu, Director, Crisil Ratings.Hakhu added that 2015 to 2017 were good years with irradiation levels 2-5% higher than average, followed by weaker 2018 and 2020 Indeed, two-thirds of the underperforming projects did so because of lower irradiation. Hence, as irradiation levels improve, the performance of these projects should also recover towards expected levels.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "The Delhi government's solar policy, which will be notified next month, aims to meet 25 per cent of the city's annual electricity demand through the clean energy by 2025, Delhi Finance Minister Kailash Gahlot announced on Wednesday. While presenting his maiden budget as finance minister, Gahlot in the assembly announced an allocation of Rs 3,348 crore for the power sector, up from Rs 3,340 crore last year, and highlighted that electricity rates have not been increased in the last eight years.  The Delhi government has treated providing minimum electricity to every household in Delhi like a fundamental right and in the year 2022-23, out of Delhi's 58.5 lakh domestic consumers, about 84 per cent had availed the Delhi government's electricity subsidy scheme,  he said in the assembly. Gahlot said the government's Solar Policy will be notified by next month and it will establish Delhi as a leading example for the country in the field of solar energy.  The Delhi Solar Policy 2022 aims to meet 25 per cent of Delhi's annual electricity demand through solar energy by 2025, which currently stands at nine per cent,  the minister said.  To achieve this, the policy has set a target of installing solar infrastructure with a capacity of 6,000 MW by 2025, which will include 750 MW of 'Roof Top Solar' (RTS),  he said. The policy also aims to generate around 12,000 green jobs in the national capital, Gahlot said. Claiming that the Delhi government has come forward as an example for the world by setting up EV (electric vehicle) charging stations with the lowest charging tariffs, he said 30 charging stations will be launched this month.  The minimum cost for EV charging is only Rs 3 per kWh, which is the lowest EV charging tariff. First 11 of 100 EV charging stations were inaugurated on October 18, 2022. Another 30 charging stations will be launched in March 2023 and the rest in the next financial year,  Gahlot said. Nearly 900 EV charging points and 103 battery swapping points will come up in the city, he said. In 2021-22, 84 per cent of the 58.5 lakh domestic consumers in the city availed the Delhi government's electricity subsidy scheme, the finance minister said and added that Delhi successfully met its peak power demand of 7,695 MW units on June 29 last year with zero load-shedding.  The aggregate technical and commercial losses of Delhi is now the lowest in the whole country at less than eight per cent,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "A parliamentary panel has attributed low installation of solar roof-top and wind energy projects as key reasons for the shortfall in achieving India's renewable energy capacity target of 175 GW by 2022. India set an ambitious target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the year 2022, which included 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from bio-power and 5 GW from small hydro-power. However, a renewable energy capacity of 120.90 GW has been installed in the country as of 31st December 2022 which is about 69 per cent of the overall target, the Standing Committee on Energy said in a report.  Keeping in view the fact that renewable energy installed capacity has increased by more than 236 per cent since 2014, this is indeed a commendable achievement. However, it should also be mentioned that whatever shortfall has occurred in achievement of the target that is because of low installation of solar roof-tops and wind energy projects,  the committee said. Keeping in view India's commitment to increase our non-fossil fuel based energy capacity to 500 GW by the year 2030, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy must ramp up its pace for timely achievement of targets, it suggested. A strict timeline should be imposed for approvals/rejection of applications, installation of net-meter, inspection of the system, etc. by the discoms and reasons should mandatorily be provided by them in case of rejection of application on the national portal, the committee said. Discoms may be incentivized so that their apprehensions regarding losing their high-paying consumers because of the installation of solar rooftops are addressed and they positively participate in the programme. The Ministry should also monitor the implementation of the rooftop solar and wind energy projects and ensure adherence to the prescribed timeline for their commissioning so that renewable energy projects do not get unduly delayed. Against the overall target of 40 GW, only 7.40 GW of rooftop solar projects could be installed in the country, the committee said adding it has been flagging the issues responsible for deficient performance under the solar rooftop programme like non-availability of information at the grass root level, lack of awareness about this scheme amongst the masses, apathy of discoms, among others. As of February 27, 2023, 43,171 number of applications were received on the National Portal, of which 18437 applications have been approved by DISCOMs, 3031 applications have been rejected on technical grounds and approval is pending for 21,703 applications. It further said that against the overall target of 60 GW, the cumulative installed capacity of wind power is 41.93 GW as on December 31, 2022. There is not even mention of wind energy in the subjects allocated to the MNRE. The committee further noted that MNRE had projected the budgetary requirement of Rs 10,422.54 crore for the financial year 2023-24 and Rs 10,222 crore has actually been allocated with an increase of about 45 per cent against Revised Estimates of the last year.  Since the Budgetary Estimates of the Ministry for 2023-24 has been considerably enhanced as compared to the previous years, the committee recommends that the ministry (MNRE) should increase its fund absorption capacity and focus on exhaustive utilization of the budgetary allocation,  the report said.",

        "articleBody": "Ahead of what may be a very hot summer, power minister RK Singh said the government is prepared to handle demand even if it goes beyond the projected peak in April and May. The shortfall of around 20 million tonnes of domestic coal in the first quarter will be met through imports, he told Shilpa Samant and Vinay Pandey in an interview. Edited excerpts:Do you think India will be able to meet power demand even in adverse weather conditions likely in the next few months?I don't think we will have any issue in the coming months. We estimate peak demand at 231 GW. We are prepared even for higher demand. We have some reserves, so we are all right. We are also blending coal, a practice that has been happening since 2009.Should blending continue in the future given the rise in demand every year?Whether it should be continued is a value judgement. I would like all the coal stocks to be domestic but that has not been so since 2009. And at this stage, when our demand is growing because of our economic growth, blending to me is no issue. So, we are not going to have a situation where we cannot meet the demand.The supply chain can be challenging when required to be stretched within a short period. Do we have the expected number of rakes needed for coal supply?In the upcoming quarter, the power sector will need about 223 million tonnes of coal, but we are getting 201 million tonnes between the coal and railways combined.So, for the quarter there will be a shortfall of around 20 million tonnes, which will be blended with imported coal.The coal production focus has shifted to different locations while the entire logistics was made for the earlier production centres. This is a process of growth and, especially with the growth India is experiencing now, this is bound to happen.How soon are you counting on renewable energy capacity addition to take the burden off domestic coal in the future?We are going to add more renewables. We have about 80 GW of renewable energy projects under construction. I expect that in a year we should be able to commission at least 55-60 GW of renewable capacity. I think that should be able to take care of the increase in power demand. In addition, thermal capacity under construction is around 27 GW, of which 2 GW has come on stream and I would expect another 14-15 GW to come next year. So, I don't think that there will be an issue as far as capacity is concerned. There will also not be an issue with coal because even if we add 50 GW of solar, then to that extent the coal saved during the day will be sufficient to meet the night demand. Our objective is simple - make sure that we have enough power to meet our country's growth requirements.The renewable energy ministry recently relaxed the approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM). Will that expedite the solar capacity addition?The ALMM is not meant to be a protection mechanism but a quality mechanism. We have only about 5 GW of solar cell manufacturing capacity on paper whereas it is only 2 GW for 500 Wp (watt peak) capacity and above. The capacity of modules above 540 Wp is also around 8-9 GW, for which cell manufacturing is only 2 GW. For the remaining, manufacturers were importing. If you import cells from overseas and just assemble them, it doesn't really help. And we have solar capacity under construction of 60 GW. With 2 GW of cell manufacturing, you can't meet that requirement. Domestic manufacturing can't be about assembling imported parts. Domestic manufacturing starts right from polysilicon onwards. We have 8,700 MW of polysilicon upwards manufacturing under installation. ",

        "articleBody": "Malaysia's Petronas has offered 38 billion rupees ($460 million) to buy a 20% stake in the green energy arm of India's largest power producer, NTPC, in the first deal of its kind by a state-run firm, three sources told Reuters. The offer price was higher than the 30 billion rupees NTPC had been expecting when it asked for expressions of interest in NTPC Green Energy (NGEL) last year and was 78% above the second-highest bidder. It values the NGEL at $2.3 billion. NTPC and Petronas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be named as the deal is still being finalised. The deal was the first time an Indian state-run company has offered a stake in a renewable energy arm and comes as the country's renewables sector is attracting increasing foreign investment. Renewables are among the country's top five industries for overseas funds this fiscal year, taking a 5% share of all inflows from April to September 2022 against 3.3% in the same period a year earlier, data from India's commerce ministry showed. Petronas outbid other local firms for the stake with an offer of 27.52 rupees per share, one government official, an industry source and a banker said. The second-highest bidder, REC Ltd , offered 15.47 rupees per share, while Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) placed a bid of 6.67 rupees per share, the banker said. REC and IGL were also not immediately available for comment. NTPC plans to use the proceeds from the sale to expand its non-fossil businesses. The company has earmarked investments of more than $30 billion in the next 10 years to raise the share of non-fossil energy in its portfolio to 45% from the present 9.41%. The company has committed to adding 60 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2032 on a total group capacity of 130 gigawatts by that date. NGEL will drive the parent company's non-fossil businesses. India has set a goal to become net-zero by 2070 and has committed to have 50% of its installed electric power capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030. The country targets 500 gigawatts of renewable energy generation by 2030. Renewable energy sources including wind, hydro and biomass, constitute 30% of the country's present installed capacity of 412 gigawatts. Earlier this month, the CEO of Petronas' clean energy arm told Reuters that India and Australia are its key markets for growth and it expects to tap more financing to meet its ambitious targets. The Petronas transaction needs to be approved by the federal government.",

The investor is likely to get a 25% stake in the InvIT that will be privately held, they said.An email sent to a Mahindra Susten spokesperson did not elicit any response till press time on Wednesday.98674790Canadian fund Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board already owns an about 30% stake in Mahindra Susten.Ontario Teachers had acquired the minority stake in Mahindra Susten in September 2022 for \u20b92,371 crore. Prior to that, in 2021, talks with Brookfield, another Canadian asset manager, for a \u20b96,000 crore sale of the business had collapsed.The IPP solar portfolio, spread over five states, is backed by long-term power purchase agreements - about 75% with central government entities and the remaining with distribution companies backed by state governments.Mahindra Susten through its third-party Utility Scale Solar business undertakes turnkey EPC projects - from solar panel installation, site survey and feasibility report to the lifetime maintenance of the plants.The company had posted a loss of \u20b949 lakh on revenue of \u20b9595 crore in FY22. The year earlier, it had reported a profit of \u20b96 crore on revenue of \u20b9\u20b9952 crore.The A+/ stable rating reflects Mahindra Susten's moderate operational and strategic linkages with its parent, Mahindra & Mahindra, said an India Rating report last year. M&M has been supporting the company through periodic equity infusions (\u20b9136 crore in FY20 and \u20b9150 crore in FY19). It did not infuse any equity in FY21-FY22, but extended unsecured loans of \u20b9575 crore. M&M shall contribute the required equity contribution for prospective projects, if required, on a need basis, said the report.The company had external debt of \u20b9965 crore at end-FY22, excluding the \u20b9575 crore loan from M&M. The debt servicing is unlikely to pose a challenge, as the project-specific debt is linked to the cash flows of power projects, said the report.InvITs are getting traction as major investment alternatives for global investors who are looking for steady returns through stable and long-term cash flows.",

Responding to starred questions on district-wise details about Surya Gujarat, state Energy Minister Kanu Desai said that more than 2.30 lakh consumers had registered for the scheme in two years till December 31, 2022, with their total installed capacity of 922 MV. The government's reply about the scheme covered 27 out of total 33 districts of the state. Ahmedabad topped with 34,794 household consumer registrations, followed by Vadodara with 33,918, Surat 30,918 and Rajkot 24,118 consumers, the minister said. The scheme - Surya Urja Rooftop Yojana-Gujarat (SURYA-Gujarat) - was launched in August 2019 to promote the installation of large-scale solar rooftop systems on private residential roof-terraces. Gujarat leads the country in solar power generation under the solar rooftop scheme, the minister said. The scheme has reduced electricity bills of consumers and helped them earn by selling excess electricity to power companies at Rs 2.25 per unit, he said. The government gives 40 per cent subsidy for up to 3 KW and 20 per cent subsidy up to 10 KW of power, Desai said. The government aims to cover eight lakh residential consumers under this scheme by 2022. Until June 2020, the Gujarat Energy Development Corporation and other power distribution companies had received more than 1.28 lakh applications for solar rooftop under the scheme through the online portal, it was stated.",

        "articleBody": "In a world of finite land, solar farms can take up a lot of space. But there\u2019s a solution for that scarcity: panels that float.In nearly a dozen countries around the world, floating solar farms are providing a welcome alternative to ground-mounted modules, with the potential to significantly boost clean power as the world races to cut carbon emissions. Massive solar farms can now be found atop bodies of water in China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Portugal, Singapore and Switzerland. Nations that include India and Indonesia are developing such projects, and the world\u2019s largest man-made lake \u2014 on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe \u2014 may also get floating solar panels to supplement local hydropower. \u201cLand use is becoming a big issue for renewables. People are worrying about competing uses of land, and in some markets, you might struggle to find land,\u201d says Lara Hayim, head of solar research at BloombergNEF. \u201cSo in those places, there is a bit of an incentive to build on water.\u201dLike land-based systems, floating solar panels generate electricity from the sun\u2019s rays. But the bodies of water that these farms rest on also help to cool the panels, allowing them to be 15% more efficient than terrestrial solar, per an estimate from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.Floating solar can complement other renewable energy sources. Thailand\u2019s hydro-floating solar hybrid system in the Sirindhorn Dam combines hydropower and floating solar, so it generates electricity in both sunny and cloudy conditions. Southeast Asian countries, including China and South Korea, invested early and heavily into floating solar. Europe is starting to catch on, too: The continent is now floating solar\u2019s second largest market, according to researcher Wood Mackenzie. As water constraints increase around the world, floating solar might also help preserve supply. The panels can limit evaporation from the reservoirs and lakes on which they sit. Early indications suggest that the structures might decrease the chances that harmful algae blooms will develop on bodies of water.But it\u2019s unclear whether floating solar could have negative impacts on wildlife and water quality, says Sika Gadzanku, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which is linked to the US Energy Department. \u201cWe need more research collaboration.\u201dFor now, the biggest obstacle to adoption \u2014 other than available space \u2014 might be cost. In addition to panels, a floating solar system requires anchoring systems to keep them locked into place. That helps make a floating farm roughly 25% more expensive to install than one on land, she says. The next frontier of floating solar may not be on Earth at all. In September, Longi Green Energy Technology Co., one of the world\u2019s biggest solar manufacturers, said it would send panels into space, the first step in plans to test the possibility of harnessing the sun\u2019s power in orbit.",

        "articleBody": "Renewable power producer Greenko Energy Holdings is raising $700 million at a valuation of $7 billion from existing investors through a rights issue, multiple people aware of the development told ET.This will make Greenko India's second-most valuable renewable power company after Adani Green Energy, which is currently valued at $10.2 billion (Rs 84,750 crore).Hyderabad-based Greenko is 52% owned by GIC of Singapore. The founder duo \u2014 Anil Chalamalasetti and Mahesh Kolli \u2014 together own 12%, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority owns 14% while the rest is owned by Japanese major Orix Corporation.  98398779The official announcement is expected as early as this weekend. The rights issue involving primary equity infusion will maintain the current shareholding structure in the company since all shareholders are participating. Greenko\u2019s current operating portfolio is 7.3 GW from 114 projects spread across 15 states.The company clocked $625 million in EBITDA (operating profit) in FY22 and is expected to close fiscal year 2023 at $650 million on revenues of $720 million. Greenko declined to comment.CAPACITY EXPANSIONThe funds will be used primarily to double the energy storage projects to 50 GWh from the present 25 GWh. The company is building the world's largest Integrated Renewable Energy Storage Project (IRESP) in Andhra Pradesh's Kurnool district with an investment of over $3 billion.The company said this 5,230 MW IRESP will play a key role in India attaining energy security and enabling global energy transition. A key buyer of this power will be ArcelorMittalNipponSteel India.According to Greenko, this 5.2 GW IRESP project is a first of its kind single location energy storage project with wind ( 550 MW) and solar ( 3,000 MW) capacities backed by pumped storage (10,800 MWh of daily storage) and will avoid 15 million tonnes of CO2 annually which is equivalent to emissions from three million cars. It\u2019s also building similar energy projects in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.Last month, the company said it would be investing Rs 10,000 crore to set up a Pumped Storage Project (PSP) near Gandhi Sagar in Neemuch District of Madhya Pradesh.BONDS REPAIDET reported on February 27 the company is extinguishing $1 billion of its outstanding bonds through a bridge loan and internal accruals and cash flows.CreditSights, a unit of Fitch Ratings, on Tuesday said it maintains its outperform recommendation on Greenko Energy, owing to its strong shareholder backing, secured nature of its outstanding dollar bonds and an improvement in its balance sheet due to the backlog of payments coming in from the Andhra Pradesh discom.CreditSights added that Greenko has ramped up its capex significantly, as its IRESPs require $2-bn investment through FY25 and are likely to burden its negative free cash flows further and necessitate additional debt incurrence.ENERGY AS A SERVICEOver the years from being a pure play utility player, Greenko has pivoted toward offering energy as a service, with storage solutions, pumped hydro helping in industrial decarbonisation. Greenko has now moved to green hydrogen and ammonia and then speciality complex chemicals. It has signed an MoU with German gas trader Uniper to supply green hydrogen from its upcoming Kakinada facility, starting 2025.In 2022, it partnered with Singapore-based Keppel Infrastructure Holdings Pte Ltd (Keppel Infrastructure) to jointly produce at least 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year.",

The embattled Adani Group, one of the country\u2019s largest solar panel makers, was not among the bidders, the people said. The financial assistance is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s aim to turn the nation into a manufacturing powerhouse, creating more jobs in the economy and reducing imports that can drain foreign exchange. His \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign is an effort to showcase the country as an alternative to China amid a global push to diversify supply chains in the wake of the pandemic. The government is offering grants to take the country\u2019s module-making capacity to as much as 90 gigawatts, enough to meet its own requirements and serve export markets. Still, the bids come amid concerns that the focus on domestic manufacturing is slowing down renewable power projects, undermining India\u2019s transition targets. Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh said last month that his ministry is considering temporarily \u201crelaxing\u201d a key barrier to module imports to speed up projects. Spokesmen at Reliance, Avaada Group and JSW Energy declined to comment. The renewables ministry, as well as Adani, Tata Power, ReNew and First Solar, didn\u2019t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.The bids, being conducted by state-run Solar Energy Corp., closed Feb. 28, after being extended multiple times. Details on incentives and projects aren\u2019t yet available. ",

RIL is starting from zero capacity and wants to go to 20 GW but it is not able to find people with relevant skills,  an industry official aware of the company's plans told ET. This has forced Mukesh Ambani's oil-to-telecom conglomerate to send mid and senior-level officials to group firm REC Group's facility in Singapore to get trained, the official said.RIL plans to use its solar capacity to power its businesses ranging from manufacturing to retail to telecom in a bid to go net zero by 2035, the person said. The company is also converting its fleet of 45,000 trucks to run on green hydrogen, production of which will require solar power. 98344143The company did not reply to an email query sent on Monday till press time on Wednesday.In October 2021, RIL's new energy subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar had acquired 100% shareholding in photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturer REC Group from China National Bluestar Group at a value of $771 million.Founded in Norway in 1996, REC has its operational headquarters in Singapore and regional hubs in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia Pacific. The 25-year-old company has three manufacturing facilities - two in Norway for making solar-grade raw polycrystalline silicon, commonly referred to as polysilicon, and another in Singapore making PV cells and modules.RIL is setting up a fully integrated solar PV manufacturing complex at Jamnagar, among others. It plans to use REC Solar's heterojunction technology (HJT) to make solar panels at the facility. This is causing a talent crunch. While HJT  is more advanced than the current mono perc technology...talent for that is not available easily,  the head of business development at a solar power company said.",

        "articleBody": "Solar capacity installations in India increased by 27 per cent to 13 gigawatts (GW) during the calendar year 2022, according to a Mercom India report.  Solar capacity made up 82 per cent of the total 16 GW new power generation capacities added in 2022,  the report titled 'Mercom India Solar Market Update' said. India added 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity in the calendar year (CY) 2022, a 27 per cent increase year-on-year (y-o-y) compared to 10.2 GW installed in CY 2021, it added. The country's cumulative installed solar capacity now stands at 63 GW, the report said. During 2022, large-scale solar projects accounted for 87 per cent of the installations. However, in October-December 2022, India added 2.6 GW of solar, down 5 per cent from 2.8 GW a year ago, it said. India's large-scale solar project pipeline stood at 58 GW, with another 51 GW of projects tendered and pending auction at the end of 2022.  Though impressive, record solar capacity additions in 2022 were barely half the 27 GW in annual installations needed to meet the 280 GW target by 2030. Policies must be quickly retooled and hurdles removed to double the annual pace of installations and attract the needed investments,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. The average cost of projects throughout CY2022 was affected due to higher module prices and supply constraints. Rajasthan, Karnataka and Gujarat were the top three states for cumulative large-scale solar capacity, accounting for 54 per cent of installations in the country as of December 2022. The report further said that  if the government lifts the requirement of (approved list of modules and manufacturers) ALMM-approved modules for domestic solar project development for two years, a significant project capacity will benefit from the expected increase in module availability in 2023 and 2024 .",

        "articleBody": "The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is again in talks with the finance ministry for giving 'grandfathering' benefits to solar power projects that were bid out before customs duty was announced on modules and cells in March 2021.The latest discussion may allow projects of around 26 GW capacity an exemption from the levy to import solar modules and cells, a senior government official told ET.The imposition of a 40% basic customs duty (BCD) duty on solar modules and 25% on solar cells came into effect in April 2022, but the announcement to impose the duties was made in March 2021. The duty is levied to protect and encourage domestic manufacturing.No relief was given to any projects after the duties were announced. 98131237The industry has said this would slow down solar power development till the time adequate domestic equipment supply is available, apart from causing an increase in solar tariffs. They have a genuine problem, so we are seeing if grandfathering can be done,  the official said.  We had tried this earlier, and we are trying again. Such projects have been allowed to pass on the higher costs through an increase in tariffs, under a notification in September 2022. But, according to the industry, this is only a marginal relief. But in change in law, there are many agencies and steps like going to state regulators. So, it is not 'ease of doing business'. We are trying to give them the benefit in one go,  the official said.Besides, any increase in tariff would make these projects unattractive and may lead to the cancellation of existing power purchase agreements, according to industry experts. We have been advocating for 'grandfathering' as it is the best solution. We hope that as soon as possible it should be clarified, and the uncertainty is resolved,  National Solar Energy Federation of India chief executive Subrahmanyam Pulipaka told ET.The renewable energy ministry has allowed an extension for the deadline to complete the solar projects that were impacted because of the delay in import of panels and cells.India is the world's third largest producer of renewable energy, with 42.25% of its installed power capacity coming from non-fossil fuel sources. The country is aiming to take its non-fossil electricity generation capacity to 500 GW by 2030.",

The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and CDPQ-backed renewable power producer published unaudited results for FY22 on December 30 but added that its audited report may differ from unaudited. It reported an operating profit of \u20b9420 crore against a gross debt of \u20b92,800 crore.Azure Global's shares at NYSE fell 41% in the intraday session after it announced the resignation of CEO Harsh Shah within two months of joining, as reported by ET on August 30, 2022. Shah resigned within days of the company expressing its inability to file the FY22 audited results within the SEC stipulated deadline of August 1, 2022.Although the Azure management has not committed to a specific timeline for releasing the audited results, timely submission of annual results is a covenant in Azure's funding lines, and a breach could result in lenders exercising their right to recall the loan facilities.Azure did not reply to ET's request for comment. While some local lenders had extended the deadline to the end of February, others had given time until the end of March, one of the persons cited above said. Azure Power India has initiated talks with Canara Bank, Yes Bank, IDBI Bank, DBS Bank, DCB Bank, Bank of Baroda, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HSBC, one of the persons cited above said. Local banks are likely to extend the deadline in line with the NYSE, the person said.Azure Power India has long-term debt of \u20b91,303 crore and a bank guarantee of \u20b9700 crore. In August 2021, Azure Power Energy raised $414 million in green bonds at a coupon of 3.575% maturing in August 2026, while its parent - Azure Power Global - in September 2019, raised $350 million in bonds at a coupon of 5.65% maturing in December 2024.",

That would require the addition of 27 gigawatts of capacity every year for the rest of the decade \u2014 more than double the volume installed last year, according to BloombergNEF forecasts.Members of the Asean bloc of nations, which has a free trade agreement with India, could add as much as 15 gigawatts of annual module imports over the next two years, according to Rustagi. A major increase in trade with China \u2014 which previously supplied India with nearly 80% of modules \u2014 remains unlikely because of a 40% tariff imposed last year, he said.",

        "articleBody": "Of India\u2019s nearly 62 GW installed solar capacity, about 50 GW is ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) plants. Recent trends show that obtaining land parcels for large solar projects is becoming increasingly difficult. Innovative and viable alternatives are needed to reach the 450 GW renewable energy (RE) target for 2030. Among the buzzwords circulating in the upper echelons of policy and decision-making is \u2018agrivoltaics\u2019. The concept aims to optimise land usage by combining agriculture with PV (agriPV). AgriPV has gained traction in countries such as Germany, Japan, and Italy and is being actively explored in the Indian context.Potential and ChallengesInitial estimates by industry experts show that India has an agriPV potential of about 2.8 TW, highlighting the immense scope of this technology. AgriPV bears the potential to provide improved conditions for the growth of specific shade-loving crops. These include leafy greens, tomatoes, root vegetables, and tubers. However, for a majority of Indian crops such as rice, wheat, and oilseeds, agriPV is likely to cause yield reduction. Hence, in an agrarian economy such as ours, regulations need to be put in place with respect to agriPV. In Germany, the yield reduction is restricted to 33% compared to the baseline scenario to qualify as agriPV. Such parameters for India need to be developed scientifically and from an economic standpoint. Deliberations with stakeholders\u2014policymakers, decision-makers, farmers, agricultural universities, and economists\u2014need to be conducted, and food security concerns need to be prioritised to ensure a holistic implementation plan for agriPV.The agriPV potential might drop significantly if important crops such as wheat, rice, and oilseeds are excluded. Despite this, the realisable agriPV potential in India remains large enough (still in TWs) to warrant an aggressive exploration plan. The primary element of risk for sustainable business plans in agriPV is farmers. History has shown that any deviation from normal farming patterns leads to disturbances and even government bills being repealed.Identifying Suitable Business ModelsPresently, some solar parks are commissioned on arid land that has been leased from farmers. In the Pavagada Solar Park (>2 GW) in Karnataka, about 13,000 acres have been leased from nearly 1,800 farmers for 28 years. The rate is ?21,000/acre/annum with a 5% biennial escalation, purportedly benefitting farmers struggling in harsh conditions. However, this rate is unlikely to woo farmers in fertile regions receiving adequate rainfall. The required lease rate will be more because the revenue/produce yield is much higher compared to arid regions. Additional compensation will be required for farmers with reduced crop yields. Higher tariffs will be quoted by developers, and subsidies will be required from the government. Adding these to a significantly higher per MW cost compared to ground-mounted PV, this business model can get prohibitively expensive. Moreover, disgruntled farmers might renege on lease rates or periods, increasing the risk for financing institutions.A farmer or farmer producer organisation (FPO) with an ineluctable stake in an agriPV project is key to its financial viability. Similar to Component A of the PM KUSUM scheme, farmer-based investments can be made in agriPV system(s). Power can be sold at a predetermined tariff to a distribution company (DISCOM). This will include a compensation component in case there is crop yield reduction. Compared to the previous scenario, the tariff will be lower since there is no lease component. At present, most states supply free/subsidised power to the agricultural sector. This leads to thousands of crores being doled out to DISCOMs annually from the state treasury. This business model allows farmers to generate their own electricity and make a profit from it. The electricity will be consumed in neighbouring fields with minimal losses. Furthermore, the tariff is expected to be lower than the average cost of supply (ACoS) of Indian DISCOMs.The Way ForwardA lacuna in the farmer(s)-owned model is the operation, maintenance, and management of the PV plant. The learning curve is steep and only a minority of farmers have the technical and financial acumen. A more elegant model will be a joint venture (JV) between a reputed developer\u2014private or state-owned\u2014and an FPO. Mutually agreed-upon lease rates and stake ratios will lead to reductions in risk exposure and loan rates. This model can work at higher scales since JVs will explore larger land parcels to reduce costs and increase margins. Regular interaction between these primary stakeholders will ensure longevity and productivity.Sustainable business models with benefits for all stakeholders can be replicated to scale up agriPV in the future. Thorough scientific research needs to be conducted to understand crop suitability based on geography. The resultant quantum of reduction or increase in crop production requires accurate analyses. This needs to be translated into a tariff component on a case-by-case basis. Policy and regulatory frameworks need to be built around these pillars for a successful agriPV road map for India.The author is a senior policy specialist in the energy and power sector at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), a research-based think tank.",

        "articleBody": "Luminous Power Technologies on Friday announced its plan to build the country's first green energy-based solar panel manufacturing facility in Uttarakhand. The new manufacturing plant located in Rudrapur is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year, a company statement said.  The state-of-the-art facility will be equipped with the latest technology to design and produce high-quality solar panels that will be used for both residential and commercial applications, it stated.  Once operational, the facility, spread across 4.5 lakh square feet/10 acres will help enable a solar production capacity of 500 MW per annum, expandable up to 1 GW, producing a range of solar panels with a power output of 40W to 600W.  With the commencement of this factory, Luminous would establish its first facility in solar panel.  Commenting on this, Preeti Bajaj, CEO and Managing Director, Luminous Power Technologies, said in the statement,  We are excited to announce the set up of our first solar panel facility in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand. This is a major step forward in Luminous Power Technologies' journey towards enabling a cleaner and more sustainable future and aligns with hon'ble prime minister's goal of being net zero by 2070.   Rajiv Ganju, Senior Vice President, Global Supply Chain, Luminous Power Technologies, said that the plant has been certified as a green facility by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) and will significantly mitigate concerns around CO2 emissions, with an estimated reduction of more than 70 million tonnes per year.  This solar panel facility is fully robotic and will use 100 per cent energy from solar power, he noted.  Annual production capacity of the facility will be equivalent to carbon sequestration of planting one crore trees, making a major contribution to the reduction of CO2 emissions.  Luminous Power Technologies provides innovative and sustainable energy solutions to meet the growing demand for clean energy in India.

The policy is just two months old and we have already received investment commitments worth Rs 2 lakh crore in the solar and related sectors,  the minister said in reply to a question on investment targets in the RE sector.  Rooftop solar projects along with ground-mounted projects in agriculture fields will be the growth drivers of the green energy demand in the state, he said.  Besides, the government aims to set up utility scale projects, ultra mega solar parks, distributed solar systems and development of model solar cities etc, Sharma said.  He urged investors to invest in the state, noting that the policy provides for various subsidies, incentives for solar energy generation and storage.  The state has also launched a Bio Energy Policy 2022 to help the country meet its net-zero goals, Sharma said.  Sharing details of the policy, he said it aims at setting up compressed bio gas plants, bio-coal, bio-diesel/bio-ethanol plants utilising different kinds of wastes like agri waste, waste from sugar mills, municipal waste, among others.  Besides, the investors under this policy will be given support like exemption from stamp duty for acquisition of land for such projects, exemption of electricity duty for a period of 10 years etc.  Sharma said there are immense business opportunities in the clean energy sector in the state and investors must tap these areas for good returns.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma today paid rich tributes to Swami Vivekananda to mark his birth anniversary at a programme organized by Bharatiya Janata Yuva Mancha (BJYM) Assam Parishad at ITA Machkhowa. Sarma while thanking BJYM for organizing the programme, said that the life of Swami Vivekananda is full of inspiration. He said that Swami ji was an epitome of Indian Renaissance who showed the world the essence of Hinduism. His address to the Parliament of World Religions held in Chicago in 1893 was a defining moment for India and the Sanatan Dharma. He, on this occasion called upon Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha to arrange for playing and listen to Vivekananda\u2019s iconic speech to make the youth of the state aware with the message and teachings of Swami ji.  The Chief Minister said that the Renaissance started in the 19th century was greatly motivated and guided by Swami Vivekananda. He left an indelible mark in the cultural, social, spiritual, political, academic life of the nation and its people. He said that India is a great nation which is 5000 years old. However, he said that there has been a constant attempt on the part of some vicious elements to distort the original history of the country. The Chief Minister said that the youth of the country should be vigilant to foil such move. They should take inspiration from the personalities like Swami Vivekananda, Lachit Barphukan to become self-confident and self-reliant to defy the evil design of the unscrupulous elements and contribute to the progress of the nation.

        "articleBody": "India may exempt some solar projects from paying duties on equipment imports, according to government and industry sources, to bring renewable-energy capacity additions back on schedule and lower consumer power tariffs. Projects with 30 gigawatts of capacity will benefit, the sources said. In March 2021, the government announced 25% basic customs duties on solar photovoltaic cells and 40% on solar photovoltaic modules with effect from April 1, 2022 in order to block Chinese imports and encourage indigenous manufacturing. Exemption is being considered for projects that were awarded under tariff-based bidding by central agencies before the announcement was made on March 9, 2021, according to a government official and two company executives privy to the matter. They asked not to be named. The exemption would speed up implementation of the projects, which have been delayed by at least a year. The finance ministry declined to comment and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy did not immediately respond to a query sent by Reuters. The official added that the finance ministry was considering exempting these projects in the Feb. 1 budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1. In September, the government provided partial relief to developers by allowing such solar projects to pass on price increases due to taxes to consumers after approval from power regulators. That resulted in higher power tariffs - and delays as developers went through the procedures. The industry officials said these projects were under cost pressure because their developers had quoted aggressively low tariffs to win contracts in auctions held by central agencies in 2020-21 but had not expected to pay the import duties. Solar power projects with a combined capacity of at least 30 gigawatts have been either delayed or are facing an uncertain future due to the increase in module prices and also due to supply constraints, according to the National Solar Energy Federation of India. More than 90% of equipment for the Indian solar-electricity industry comes from China. Domestic manufacturing has not developed far, despite government support. Imported solar modules cost about 40 cents per watt of capacity while domestic ones cost 37 cents per watt. This is against 27 to 28 cents per watt for imported modules three years ago.",

        "articleBody": "The developer of a $21-billion project aiming to deliver solar power to Singapore from Australia has collapsed as its two main backers, Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, failed to agree on a new round of funding. Singapore-based Sun Cable said it had appointed voluntary administrators less than a year after raising A$210 million from the two billionaires for the Australia-Asia PowerLink project.  While funding proposals were provided, consensus on the future direction and funding structure of the company could not be achieved,  Sun Cable said in a statement. Tech billionaire and climate activist Cannon-Brookes, who became chairman of Sun Cable in October, said he remained confident in the project. It involves building a 20 gigawatt (GW) solar farm, 42 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy storage in northern Australia and the world's longest undersea cable to deliver power to Singapore, and eventually, Indonesia. Construction was due to begin in 2024.  I fully back this ambition and the team, and look forward to supporting the company's next chapter,  he said in the statement. The statement offered no comment from iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest's privately owned Squadron Energy, Sun Cable's other big stakeholder. It is still possible Squadron could put together a funding deal for the administrators, said a person familiar with the company's thinking who sought anonymity because of confidentiality provisions. Last year's capital raising of A$210 million included milestones that have not been met yet, meaning that not all of that funding was made available. Future steps are likely to involve voluntary administrators FTI Consulting seeking fresh capital or selling the business entirely, Sun Cable said. ($1=1.4499 Australian dollars).",

        "articleBody": "Thailand\u2019s state-owned PTT Group, also the country\u2019s biggest conglomerate, has restarted discussions to buy a 49% stake in solar assets of ReNew Power totalling 3GW, said people aware of the matter. ReNew Power is the Indian arm of Nasdaq-listed ReNew Energy Global Plc., which was founded by Sumant Sinha in 2011. ReNew's solar and wind portfolio totals 13.4 GW, of which 7.7 GW has been commissioned. Its solar asset base is 4.10 GW of commissioned and committed capacity.In 2020, PTT was in talks with Goldman Sachs, then the single largest shareholder of ReNew Power, to buy at least half its stake in the company at a valuation of about $2.2 billion by investing a minimum $500 million. Those talks fizzled out after months of negotiations. In early 2021, ReNew Power announced a merger with Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) RMG Acquisition Corp. II at an enterprise value of about $8 billion. Later that year, the Thai energy giant went on to invest $453 million (14.8 billion baht) for a 41.6% stake in Avaada Energy Pvt. Ltd through the subscription of new shares. Global Power Synergy (GPSC), a listed power unit of PTT, was used as the vehicle for the investment, underscoring the rising interest of Southeast Asian oil and gas companies in green ventures.  96773851PTT is once again undertaking due diligence of ReNew\u2019s portfolio, said analysts.\u201cTwo years ago when they first did an exhaustive diligence on the company, many of the assets were under construction,\u201d said an executive. \u201cNow they are commissioned. So there is a familiarity that already exists.\u201d The enterprise value of the aforementioned 3GW solar portfolio is pegged at Rs 12,000-14,000 crore ($1.5-1.75 billion).A lion\u2019s share of this portfolio consists of Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) bids with an average tariff of Rs 2.5-3 per unit. Industry executives say the cost of building these projects would be around 7-7.5 times ev/ebitda (enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation).The recent sale of Global Infrastructure Partners\u2019 Indian clean energy platform Vector Green Energy to Singapore\u2019s Sembcorp Industries Ltd. was at 8.5 times ev/ebitda (enterprise multiple), setting a benchmark of sorts.\u201cAs a policy, we do not comment on market speculation,\u201d said a ReNew Power spokesperson. PTT Group didn\u2019t respond to queries.Analysts tracking the sector are surprised that PTT, which already has an investment in India, would explore a competing investment. People close to Avaada said they are not aware of any discussions PTT might be having with ReNew and said it has an exclusivity arrangement with the Thai group in India. There is still no guarantee that even this round of talks with PTT will lead to a transaction, said the people cited above. As of September 2022, power purchase agreements (PPAs) for operating projects had an average remaining life of just below 20 years, which provides visibility into the company\u2019s long-term cash flow. At the end of the September quarter, Renew Energy Global Plc.'s loss narrowed to Rs 98.6 crore against a net loss of Rs 661.4 crore a year ago. Total income was at Rs 2,240.9 crore. The company has been talking of capital recycling by churning or unlocking value in its older portfolio to reinvest the proceeds in building new clean energy assets.For example, Torrent Power Ltd is in talks to buy clean power projects totalling 1.1 GW from ReNew Energy Global Plc. at an enterprise value of around $1.2 billion, Mint reported on January 2. ReNew announced on Wednesday that Norway\u2019s Climate Investment Fund, managed by Norfund, together with Norwegian pension fund KLP, will invest Rs 90 crore ($10.85 million) for a 49% stake in a transmission project in Karnataka being developed by ReNew. In November, ReNew Power signed an agreement with the government of Egypt to set up a green hydrogen plant in the Suez Canal Economic Zone with an investment of $8 billion, targeting annual production of 2,20,000 tonnes of the gas.However, ReNew Energy Global\u2019s stock is languishing at $5.16 on the Nasdaq, marginally up from its historic low of $5.06 in December 2021, but down 53% from its $11 listing price in August 2021. At the end of September, the company had about $700 million cash on its balance sheet and anticipated raising a similar amount through internal cash flows, capital recycling and improvements in working capital by FY25. It surprised the market by announcing a $250 million share buyback last February.The diversified PTT Group, with business interests in oil and gas exploration, petrochemicals, fuel and coffee retailing, pivoted toward renewables in 2019 with clean energy arm GPSC buying electricity producer Glow Energy Plc. for $4.2 billion. Separately listed GPSC, formed by merging several of PTT\u2019s power utility arms in 2013, also bought Brookfield Renewable Partners\u2019 Thailand-based solar energy business for $100 million in 2020. The Thai group in 2021 laid out plans for growth and increased its renewable power target to 12 GW by 2030 from 8 GW previously. It targets 9 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year and reaching 8 GW of electricity from conventional sources by 2030. It plans to have at least 30% of net income from new energy and business sources such as electric vehicles (EVs), life sciences and logistics by 2030. In May 2021, it announced a partnership with Taiwan's Foxconn for EV production in Thailand.",

        "articleBody": "The Delhi government on Thursday approved the draft of its ambitious Solar Policy 2022 which revises the installed capacity to 6,000 MW from 2,000 MW by 2025, a three-fold jump in as many years. Delhi's new solar policy targets 6,000 MW of installed solar capacity by 2025 to increase the share of solar energy in Delhi's annual electricity demand from 9 per cent to 25 per cent in three years, the highest in India, said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.  The government had targeted an installed capacity of 2,000 MW solar power by 2025 in its 2016 solar policy.  The policy aims to create a unified single-window state portal managed by the Delhi Solar Cell that will provide information on the benefits of solar PV systems, process-related guidelines, and timeline.   To motivate consumers to use solar energy, the government will provide various incentives such as generation-based incentives (GBI) and capital subsidies. For the first time in the country, consumers will have an opportunity for Community Solar and Peer-to-Peer trading,  Sisodia said  The policy will provide capital subsidies for residential as well as commercial consumers in Delhi, he said.  The draft Delhi Solar Policy 2022 will now be in the public domain for 30 days for comments from stakeholders, after which it will be tabled in the Cabinet for final approval.   The new solar policy will further boost the efforts of the Delhi government to fight pollution while generating 12,000 new jobs. It will make Delhi a model for states and cities not just in India but also across the world in enabling sustainable clean energy transition,  the deputy CM said.  The draft policy provides for monthly GBI for residential, group housing societies and resident welfare associations, and commercial and industrial consumers for five years from the date of commissioning of the solar power .  The GBI will be Rs 3/kWh for residential solar systems up to 3 kW, Rs 2/kWh for residential solar systems above 3 kW and up to 10kW, Rs 2/kWh for CGHS and RWAs with solar systems up to 500kW (at 10kW per house).  An early-bird GBI of Rs 1/kWh will be offered for the first time for commercial and industrial consumers for the first 200 MW of solar deployment.  For residential consumers, a capital subsidy for mounting structures (raised structures that have a minimum ground clearance greater than six feet) will be provided at the rate of Rs 2,000 per kW up to a maximum of Rs 10,000 per consumer and adjusted against electricity bills, as per the policy.  Taxes and duties will not be levied on generation from RTS (roof top solar) panels whether for self-consumption or supplied to the grid.  To increase the uptake of RTS panels, the policy also encourages new deployment models such as Hybrid RESCO, Community Solar and Peer-to-Peer trading. A Hybrid RESCO model is envisioned for the first time in India through the draft Delhi Solar Policy 2022 for all consumers, a Delhi government statement said.  This model enables consumers to access the net metering benefits of solar without making any upfront capital investment by entering into an agreement with their power discom.  For the first time in the country, 'Community Solar' will be set in place. It will enable consumers who do not have a suitable roof for installing a solar system to be owners of a part of a larger solar energy system set up by a developer within an available land parcel in Delhi, the statement said.  'Peer-to-Peer Trading' of solar energy will also be set in place. It will enable owners of solar energy systems to sell their excess generated electricity in real-time via a P2P energy trading platform.  The policy also encourages discoms to increase the share of solar energy procured from outside Delhi through innovative models such as RE-RTC (Renewable Energy-Round the Clock).  It combines a host of renewable energy sources (solar, wind and others) alone with appropriately sized battery storage to provide round-the-clock power as per the demand curve of Delhi, the statement said.",

Solar PV power developers/associations have represented to MNRE that there is a supply chain disruption in the solar PV sector and have requested appropriate reliefs to tackle the same,  the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) said in a notification on Thursday.  This issue has been examined in the Ministry and it has been decided that implementing agencies SECI/NTPC/NHPC may extend the scheduled commissioning date (SCD) till 31.03.2024 and commensurately extend other associated intermediate milestones of such solar PV/Solar PV-wind hybrid power projects, wherein the last date of bid submission was on or after 10.04.2021 and whose SCD, including time-extensions, already granted, if any, is before 31.03.2024, and who wish to avail such time-extension,  it said. This extension would not be available to those projects which did not sign the PPA (power purchase agreement) before October 1, 2022. The decision has been issued with the approval of the Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy, the notification said. Supply chain disruptions, changes in tariff regime and the pandemic were among the reasons for the shortfall in meeting the targeted 60 GW of wind energy in the country by 2022, MNRE Minister RK Singh informed Parliament on December 13. He also said that till October 31, 2022, only 7.2 GW of rooftop solar capacity has been achieved. The minister cited  apprehension of possible revenue loss by DISCOMs, delay in getting approvals from different agencies, delay in installation of net/gross metres by DISCOMs, lack of uniform regulations, lack of awareness among the prospective beneficiaries, etc  as the major reasons for the shortfall of rooftop solar installation. The government has set a target of having 175 GW of renewable energy capacity, including 100 GW of solar, 60 GW of wind energy, 10 GW of bio-power and 5 GW from small hydropower projects, by 2022.",

        "articleBody": "The rooftop solar capacity installations fell to 1.09 gigawatt during January-September 2022 due to reasons like supply chain disruption in solar modules and delay in tenders by state implementing agencies, Parliament was informed Thursday. At 1.09 GW, the installation was over 4 per cent lower compared to 1.14 GW in the nine-month period of 2021, according to the data shared by Minister for New and Renewable Energy R K Singh in Lok Sabha.   The reduction in rooftop solar capacity installation during 2022 compared to installations during 2021 as mentioned above is due to various factors including present supply chain disruption in solar modules, delay in tenders by state implementing agencies under Rooftop Solar Programme Ph-II, delays in approvals and installation of net-meters by DISCOMs, etc,  Singh said in a written reply to a question.  The minister further said that his ministry has taken several steps to enhance rooftop solar installations in the country, which include following up with states/discoms to expedite approvals and installation of net-meters.  Other steps are simplification of procedure for installation of rooftop solar in the residential sector under Rooftop Solar Programme Ph-II, and launch of the national portal in July 2022 to simplify the procedure for installation, among others.",

        "articleBody": "All new houses in Tokyo built by large-scale homebuilders after April 2025 must install solar power panels to cut household carbon emissions, according to a new regulation passed by the Japanese capital's local assembly on Thursday. The mandate, the first of its kind for a Japanese municipality, requires about 50 major builders to equip homes of up to 2,000 square metres (21,500 square feet) with renewable energy power sources, mainly solar panels. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike noted last week that just 4% of buildings where solar panels could be installed in the city have them now. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government aims to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 2000 levels. Japan, the world's fifth-largest carbon emitter, has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 but faces difficulty as it has relied heavily on coal-burning thermal power after most of its nuclear reactors were in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.  In addition to the existing global climate crisis, we face an energy crisis with a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war,  Risako Narikiyo, a member of Koike's regional party Tomin First no Kai, said at the assembly on Thursday.  There is no time to waste. ",

        "articleBody": "India's rapid advances in solar power production have been widely celebrated for showing how fast-developing economies can accelerate the decarbonisation of their energy systems without jeopardising economic growth. But while the pace of India's solar rollout has been impressive, the advances have come mainly at the expense of natural gas - they have had little impact on the country's use of coal as the primary source of electricity. Indeed, India increased the amount of electricity generated from coal in the opening 10 months of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021, and slashed gas-powered generation by nearly 40%, according to data from Ember. This has resulted in a continuing climb in India's power sector emissions, even as solar's share of the country's electricity generation mix has more than doubled since 2019. SOLAR SURGE Between 2017 and 2021, India's solar power production capacity more than tripled, ranking third globally in terms of solar capacity additions during that window, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. And the country plans to more than double that solar capacity base again by 2025, leaving it highlighted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as a key driver behind its recent dramatic upward revision to its global renewable energy supply outlook. On paper, such rapid advances in green energy supplies should result in reduced pollution from the country's energy producers. However, cumulative emissions from India's power sector have scaled new highs in the opening 10 months of 2022, topping 818 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and equivalent gases. That's up nearly 7% from the same period in 2021. The main driver of the climb in power pollution has been a 7.7% climb in discharges from coal-fired generation, which accounted for 72% of the country's electricity and 97% of power sector emissions through October, Ember data shows. GAS SQUEEZE While coal's share of India's electricity mix has remained fairly flat at that elevated level, the share of gas-fired electricity has fallen sharply in 2022 to just 1.6%, the lowest since at least 2019. Record high liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices were the main reason behind this downturn in gas use, as cost-conscious utilities balked at paying more than twice as much for spot LNG cargoes in 2022 as the 2021 average. Reduced demand for LNG was also reflected in India's LNG import totals. These dropped by 16% through November from the same period in 2021, according to ship-tracking data by Kpler. Those sharply lower LNG imports by India - the fourth largest importer in 2021 - freed up LNG cargoes for others in 2022, and helped alleviate the power crisis in Europe resulting from sharply lower Russian pipelined natural gas supplies amid the war in Ukraine. However, for India's power producers, with limited options for generating baseload electricity, less gas simply meant they have had to burn more coal in 2022. This is because while non-emitting solar power adds to overall electricity supplies during the day, India's overall grid requires a steady supply of baseload power at all times, and especially at night. This can be produced effectively by burning fossil fuels. Natural gas had been expected to displace coal as that preferred baseload fuel over time in India, thanks to planned investments in gas import infrastructure and pipelines, as well as policy support to scale back use of high-polluting coal in power generation. But the recent surge in gas prices is now threatening to not just stall, but reverse those trends, halting gas-related investments and supporting continuing reliance on coal. Solar will remain the new fuel of choice for utilities developing additional power generation capacity in India, thanks to government subsidies and widespread support for green energy expansions. But if global gas prices remain elevated throughout 2023, Indian electricity producers will continue to burn more coal than ever to generate baseload power, undermining the environmental benefits of record-setting renewable supply expansions.",

The power generated at the solar plant will be used to pull water from Narmada river in Jalud village of neighbouring Khargone district and supply it to Indore, Divyank Singh, the chief executive officer of Indore Smart City Development Limited told PTI. The Madhya Pradesh government had given a nod to the IMC's green bond policy and efforts were initiated on Friday to get the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) clearance for the project, he said.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Indore on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on January 9. We will try our best to have his presence during the listing of green bonds,  Singh said. Apart from Indore, people from other parts of the country can invest in the eight-year duration bonds and earn attractive returns. Indore, which has bagged the tag of the cleanest city in the country six consecutive times, has a population of 35 lakh and is largely dependent on Narmada river for its water needs. According to officials, the IMC has to foot a heavy bill of Rs 25 crore every month to bring water to Indore from Jalud village, which is 80 km away, and the solar power plant will help cut the expenditure.",

The corporation has saved Rs 31,37,536 till date since the commissioning of this project, which is spread over 1,235 square metres on the rooftop of two sheds of Madgaon railway station platforms. The system costing Rs 1.32 crore was sponsored by the then South Goa Member of Parliament Narendra Sawaikar in 2019,  he said. The project fulfils more than 30 per cent of power requirement of the Madgaon railway station. It is expected to give a return on investment in around seven years, Ghatge said. The project has generated 4,53,404 units of electricity since it was commissioned, he added. ",

        "articleBody": "India unveiled a Rs 2.44 lakh crore ($29.6 billion) plan to build transmission lines to connect renewable generation, as it aims to nearly triple its clean-power capacity by 2030.The project will connect solar plants in the sun-drenched deserts of Rajasthan and Gujarat and wind farms in Tamil Nadu to the national network, the power ministry said in a statement. It will help boost India\u2019s inter-regional transmission capacity from 112 gigawatts to 150 gigawatts by the end of the decade. A lack of transmission lines has held back renewable electricity in India. As the nation embarks on its path to net zero by 2070, it needs to address this shortfall so that clean power can flow to urban and industrial hubs that are often far from generation sources. India has a generation capacity of 173 gigawatts from non-fossil fuel sources and plans to almost triple it to 500 gigawatts by 2030. The transmission plan includes building transformers and high voltage lines to carry power long distances, as well as laying submarine cables to ship electricity from offshore wind projects. The power networks sector welcomed the plan, but sounded a note of caution on how contracts will be awarded. Private transmission companies have been lobbying New Delhi to allocate all projects through competitive bids, rather than the current practice of giving some to state-run Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. without competition. \u201cThe plan presents a very large opportunity to the industry and is absolutely crucial to India\u2019s renewables ambitions,\u201d said Vijay Chhibber, director general at lobby group Electric Power Transmission Association, which represents the private network companies. \u201cWhat we still need is a complete clarity on how these projects will be awarded.\u201d ",

        "articleBody": "Swiss investment firm Partners Group has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Gurgaon-headquartered renewable energy company Sunsure Energy for $400 million (about \u20b93,290 crore).The investment in Sunsure Energy, which has historically built solar plants for commercial and industrial users, is to help transform the company into an independent power producer which will have 3 gigawatt of operational capacity and sell power directly to commercial and industrial customers. Sunsure is a transformational, next generation infrastructure investment opportunity in India's growing renewable energy sector, which has been a thematic focus area at Partners Group for many years,  said Luv Parikh, managing director, private infrastructure Asia, Partners Group.Parikh said the investment would support Sunsure Energy in executing its pipeline of renewable projects and assist the company in offering new services to commercial and industrial customers.Sunsure Energy CEO Shashank Sharma said the company is focused on bridging the gap between the availability of solar and wind power and its production in India.  We believe Sunsure's transition into an independent power producer is the best way to ensure more businesses benefit from low-cost solar and wind power in the future,  he said. He added Partners Group's extensive experience in the renewable and decarbonisation sectors and its financial resources made it an ideal partner.EY was the financial adviser to Sunsure Energy on the stake sale.Sunsure Energy was founded in 2015 by Sharma, Shantanu Faugaat, Manish Mehta, Kartikeya N Sharma and Tarunveer Singh.Partners Group manages $185 billion in private equity, private real estate, private debt and private infrastructure on behalf of its clients globally. In India, it is the co-owner of retail chain Vishal Megamart along with private equity firm Kedaara Partners. Its other investments include Ecomm Express and Avas Financiers.Renewable energy investors have been active in India and have demonstrated an appetite to buy majority stakes in Indian renewable energy companies.India has made a commitment to generate 500 gigawatt of power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 and reduce carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by the end of the decade at the COP26 conference held in Glasgow in November last year. It will aim to meet 50% of its energy requirements from renewables.The ambitious targets have also spurred deal activity in the sector.In November, KKR joined forces with Vedanta group and committed an investment of $400 million to a new renewable energy platform that will be called Serentica Renewables in which both will be co-investors.The US private equity firm had also set up Virescent Infrastructure as a renewable energy platform in 2019 that is structured as an infrastructure investment trust.KKR also invested $450 million in Hero Future Energies along with the Hero Group in September.Similarly, global investor Actis has also been actively investing in the Indian renewable energy sector. It has set up and then successfully divested two large renewable energy platforms, Ostro Energy and Sprng Energy, over the past five years. Sprng Energy was purchased by energy giant Shell Plc for $1.55 billion.It's third Indian renewable energy platform BluPine Energy was incorporated in 2021 and is again building a portfolio of renewable energy assets.The industry has evolved and includes a variety of renewable energy producers with shareholding structures that differ. These include Indian startups that have raised funding from financial investors who are either majority owners of the business or remain significant minority investors, foreign renewable energy companies that have set up operations in India and renewable power producers spun out of Indian corporate houses.",

        "articleBody": "Installation of open access solar capacity in India increased by 91 per cent to 596 megawatt (MW) during the July-September period, according to Mercom Research India. India added 312 MW of solar open access capacity in the same period a year ago, the research firm said in a report on Thursday.  Solar power through open access is an arrangement where a power producer establishes a solar power plant to supply green energy to consumers.  In the first nine months (9M) of 2022, India added about 1.9 gigawatts (GW) of open access solar, an increase of 96 per cent from the 956 megawatts (MW) installed in January-September of 2021, the report titled 'Mercom India Solar Open Access Market Report Q3 2022' said.  According to the report, as of September 2022, the total installed solar capacity in the open access segment was over 7 GW, and the pipeline of projects under development and pre-construction phase is over 5 GW.   The demand by corporates for solar under the open access route has been phenomenal. The growth would have been steeper if not for the supply constraints and price increase.   The pipeline of projects to be commissioned is impressive and bigger than ever. While the demand has mostly been from large corporates,  said Priya Sanjay, Managing Director at Mercom India.  Karnataka remained the top state, with a total solar open access capacity of approximately 2.7 GW, followed by Maharashtra (801 MW). The top five states accounted for 74 per cent of the country's cumulative open access solar installations.  The MD further said there is a huge untapped market of SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) and MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) due to lack of awareness.  Mercom Research India is organising an industry meet for commercial and industrial consumers on December 9, 2022, in Noida, Uttar Pradesh to create awareness about solar energy adoption.",

        "articleBody": "Researchers from IISER-Thiruvananthapuram and IIT-Indore have developed a new artificial light-harvesting system that can efficiently capture light for power conversion by mimicking photosynthesis, the process by which plants absorb sunlight and produce sugars. The research has been published in the prestigious 'Royal Chemical Society - Chemical Science' journal. According to officials, scientists across the globe are trying to replicate the light-harvesting step of photosynthesis in engineered systems for use in solar cells or artificial leaves. Biswarup Pathak, a professor in the Department of Chemistry at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Indore, said,  The light-harvesting cores in plants and other photosynthetic bacteria are chromophores, molecules that absorb visible light and pass it on to other components that use the energy for various chemical reactions. The top-most chromophores that are exposed to the sun absorb the energy.  The chromophores are arranged in arrays and an energised chromophore passes the energy to the adjoining chromophore and so on. There is a rapid cascade of energy until the energy reaches its destination.  There have been many attempts at replicating the molecular and atomic structure of the light-harvesting mechanism in the lab. Polymeric structures, detergent-type molecules, vesicles, gels, and other bio-inspired structures have been used to mimic photosynthesis, Pathak explained. The most common problem faced by such molecules is that the light is quenched due to aggregation or bunching up of the molecules together. This leads to poor light capture and conversion efficiencies, he said. Sukhendu Mandal, an associate professor at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)-Thiruvananthapuram, said,  This is the first time we have utilised an atom-precise nanocluster in such an application. The opposite charges on the surfaces and the matched electronic energy distribution result in a 93 per cent energy transfer efficiency with a great antenna effect from the UV-to-visible region of the light spectrum.  The researchers also showed that this harvested energy could generate current with much enhanced yields compared to the individual components.  This fundamental investigation into highly-efficient energy transfer systems will provide the basis for designing new light-harvesting materials that can enhance the efficiency of solar cells and reduce energy loss.  This is important given that India aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070 and to meet 50 per cent of its electricity needs from renewable sources such as solar power by 2030,  Mandal said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Rooftop solar capacity installations in India fell 29 per cent to 320 megawatt (MW) in July-September 2022, according to Mercom Research India. The country added 448 MW rooftop solar capacity in the same quarter a year ago, the research firm said in a report on Thursday. During January-September, the installations at 1,165 MW were also down 11 per cent compared to 1,310 MW in the corresponding nine-month period of the last year, the report titled 'Mercom India Rooftop Solar Market Report Q3 2022' said. In the third quarter of 2022, 46 per cent of rooftop solar capacity was installed in the industrial sector, followed by 32 per cent in residential, commercial 21 per cent and the remaining in the government sector. According to the report, at the end of Q3 2022, cumulative rooftop solar installations reached 8.3 GW.  We are seeing rooftop solar installations trending down as costs have risen. The market is struggling with supply issues because of the Approved List of Module and Manufacturers (ALMM), and installers are finding it a tough environment to operate in overall,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. The tendering process increased 46 per cent year-on-year to around 311 MW of rooftop solar projects in July-September 2022, of which 33 per cent were announced by the Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency, 16 per cent by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and 51 per cent by other state agencies. Gujarat became the leading state with the highest rooftop solar installations, followed by Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The top 10 states accounted for approximately 73 per cent of cumulative rooftop solar installations. According to the statement, Mercom Research India is organising an industry meet for commercial and industrial consumers on December 9, 2022, in Noida, Uttar Pradesh to create awareness about solar energy adoption.",

        "articleBody": "The Punjab government has decided to install solar power photovoltaic (PV) projects with a total capacity of 300 megawatt in the state. These projects include 200 MW canal-top solar PV power projects and 100 MW floating solar PV power projects on the reservoirs and lakes, said an official statement while giving details of the decision taken in a high-level meeting held here on Monday. The meeting was chaired by Punjab New and Renewable Energy Sources Minister Aman Arora. The proposed 200 MW canal-top solar project would be installed in a phased manner, under which 50 MW would be installed in the first phase, while projects of remaining capacity would be installed in subsequent phases, Arora added. These projects will be executed in build, operate and own (BOO) mode by the Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA), he said. While discussing in the meeting, the feasibility of setting up these projects, the minister said, viability gap funding (VGF) has been proposed to be claimed from the Department of Economic Affairs under the Union Ministry of Finance, under their scheme. Notably, VGF is designed to provide capital support to PPP projects, which would not otherwise be financially viable. The canal-top solar power projects will be installed on small distributaries having less width, which will involve less civil work. The cost of the canal-top solar PV projects is expected to be around Rs 5 crore per MW after taking into consideration of 20 per cent VGF, Arora said. Similarly, floating solar PV projects are also an emerging idea being implemented in the country for using the potential area on lakes and reservoirs, the statement said. The cost of floating solar PV projects would be around Rs 4.80 crore per MW after considering 20 per cent VGF, it said. PTI SUN BAL BAL",

        "articleBody": "The commerce ministry has terminated an anti-dumping investigation into import of solar cells from China, Thailand and Vietnam following a request from the Indian Solar Manufacturers Association (ISMA).  On May 15, 2021, the ministry's investigation arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) initiated a probe into alleged dumping of  solar cells whether or not assembled into modules or panels  exported from the three nations, following a complaint by the association.   In view of the request made by the domestic industry, ISMA,...the authority hereby terminates the investigation initiated on May 15, 2021... against the imports of solar cells whether or not assembled into modules or panels exported by these countries,  the DGTR said in a notification.  Anti-dumping rules, 1995 provide for termination of a probe in certain situations which include withdrawal of application by the affected domestic industry at whose instance the investigation was initiated.  The notification said the applicant through an e-mail dated July 14, 2022 withdrew the application.  Post initiation of the probe, the government levied customs duties of 25 per cent on solar cells and 40 per cent on solar modules with effect from April 1 this year.  The ISMA has submitted to the directorate that the imposed duties cover the entire scope of the product under investigation and have alleviated the price pressure being suffered by the domestic industry due to the dumping to a considerable extent, though not fully, the DGTR notification said.  While the DGTR recommends the duty, the Department of Revenue takes the final decision to impose it. In international trade parlance, dumping happens when a country or a firm exports an item at a price lower than the price of that product in its domestic market.  Dumping impacts the price of that product in the importing country, hitting the margins and profits of manufacturing firms.  The duty is imposed only after a thorough investigation by a quasi-judicial body, such as the DGTR, in India. It is aimed at ensuring fair trade practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India saved USD 4.2 billion in fuel costs through solar generation in the first half of 2022 and 19.4 million tonnes of coal that would have further stressed an already strained domestic supply, according to a new report released on Thursday. The report by energy think tank Ember, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis also analysed the growth of solar power over the last decade and found that five of the top 10 economies with solar capacity are now within Asia, including China, Japan, India, South Korea and Vietnam.  The contribution of solar generation in seven key Asian countries -- China, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand -- avoided potential fossil fuel costs of approximately USD 34 billion from January to June 2022, the report said.  This is equivalent to 9 percent of total fossil fuel costs during this period, it added.   In India, solar generation avoided USD 4.2 billion in fuel costs in the first half of the year. It also avoided the need for 19.4 million tonnes of coal that would have further stressed an already strained domestic supply,  the report stated.  The report finds that the majority of the estimated USD 34 billion savings are in China, where solar met 5 percent of the total electricity demand and avoided around USD 21 billion in additional coal and gas imports during the period.  Japan saw the second-highest impact, with USD 5.6 billion in avoided fuel costs thanks to solar power generation alone.  Vietnam's solar power avoided USD 1.7 billion in additional fossil fuel costs, a sizable growth from nearly zero terawatt hours of solar generation in 2018. In 2022, solar accounted for 11 percent (14 TWh) of the electricity demand from January to June.  In Thailand and the Philippines, where the growth in solar has been slower, the avoided fuel cost is still notable, the report said.  While solar only accounted for 2 percent of Thailand's electricity in the first six months of 2022, an estimated USD 209 million of potential fossil fuel costs were avoided, it added.  The Philippines avoided USD 78 million in fossil fuel spending, despite solar accounting for only 1 percent of generation.  In South Korea, solar power generated 5 percent of the country's electricity in the first half of the year, avoiding potential fossil fuel use costing USD 1.5 billion, as per the report.  CREA's Southeast Asia Analyst Isabella Suarez said,  Asian countries need to tap into their massive solar potential to rapidly transition away from costly and highly-polluting fossil fuels. The potential savings from existing solar alone are enormous, and expediting their deployment alongside other clean energy sources such as wind, will be crucial for energy security in the region. While ambitious targets are important, follow through will be the key thing to watch moving forward. ",

The potential buyers have submitted non-binding bids recently, said two persons aware of the development. The proposed deal will value CleanMax at $1 billion, inclusive of its debt.At present, US-based Augment Infrastructure owns a majority stake in CleanMax. Last year, Augment Infrastructure acquired a majority stake from Warburg Pincus and IFC in a Rs 1,650-crore deal, which included primary capital infusion.Investment bank Rothschild is the advisor for the stake sale. According to sources, other global infrastructure investors such as Canadian fund CPP Investments (CPPIB) and Australian major Macquarie are also considering this transaction. However, this information could not be confirmed.   95263005A minority stake sale to raise $250-300 million is also an option, while the final decision is dependent on the valuation, sources said.Mails sent to Augment Infrastructure, CleanMax and NIIF did not elicit any response, while spokespersons from Brookfield and I Squared declined to comment.CleanMax Enviro Energy, incorporated in 2010 by Kuldeep Jain, operates renewable energy assets including rooftop solar projects, solar farms, wind farms and wind solar hybrid farms. It has about 350 corporate clients, including Adobe, Facebook, Cipla, Tata Motors, Bajaj, Mahindra, L&T, Carlsberg, United Spirits, Manipal University, Kajaria, GE, Dr Reddy's, Mindtree, Taj and Volvo.Since inception, the group has executed projects aggregating 774 MW - 275 MW rooftop and 499 MW ground mounted. Of this, around 257 MW has been down sold to investors, while the remaining around 517 MW is on the books of company. The group also forayed into wind power generation and wind-solar hybrid projects with an aggregate capacity of 139.5 MW.",

        "articleBody": "MODHERA: Kesa Bhai Prajapati beams with a smile as he moulds blocks of clay into jugs and vases on a potter's wheel.  These days, Prajapati, 68, from the village of Modhera in western India's Gujarat state, has doubled the amount of earthenware he makes compared to a few months ago since he no longer has to turn the wheel manually as he could not then afford high electricity bill that were up to 1,500 Indian rupees ($18.19) a month. Now, however, his machine moves on solar power as earlier this month Prajapati's village of around 6,500 residents, consisting mainly of potters, tailors, farmers and shoemakers, was declared India's first village to run entirely on solar energy all the time.  Electricity has helped us to save time and produce more products,  Prajapati said.  India, the world's third-largest carbon dioxide emitter, aims to meet half of its energy demands from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, by 2030, a boost over its previous target of 40%, the government said it achieved in December 2021. The project in Modhera, financed by the federal and provincial government at nearly $10 million, involved setting up over 1,300 rooftop panels on residential and government buildings that were connected to a power plant. The government buys excess energy produced here from residents if they do not use all of the capacity allotted to the households. With this money, Praveen Bhai, 43, a tailor, plans to buy a gas connection and stove, since many houses in the village cook food in wood-fired stoves that leave a smoky haze.  I had to teach the kids under the street lamp. Now they will be able to study inside the house.  Modhera, also known for its ancient Sun Temple dedicated to the sun god, is situated in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat, which is holding elections later this year.   For a self-reliant India of the 21st century, we have to increase such efforts related to our energy needs,  Modi said earlier this month.  For Reena Ben, 36, a housewife, who also works as a tailor part time, the solar power has hugely aided her work.  When we got access to solar power, I bought an electric motor worth 2,000 rupees ($24) to attach to the sewing machine. Now I am able to sew one or two more clothes daily. ",

        "articleBody": "India needs a strong manufacturing base and supply chain in order to make solar energy projects viable at the current low tariff level of Rs 2.50 per unit, JSW Energy Joint MD & CEO Prashant Jain has said.Talking about inflationary pressure on solar projects in an exclusive interview with ET Energyworld, Jain said that most of India's solar panels are imported from China where polysilicon prices and the overall panel prices have gone up from 20 Cents per Watt peak to 40 Cents per Watt Peak in the past. The rupee meanwhile depreciated from 72 per dollar to 83 per dollar. Commodity prices, including the prices of Aluminium, copper and steel, have shot up and shipping rates too have gone up and the government has imposed 40 per cent basic customs duty on solar imports. All these things put together have substantially raised the prices of solar panels,  Jain said. This is not so much the case with resources like hydro and wind where most of the equipment are domestically available. This inflationary pressure in case of solar has dramatically increased the project costs. So, anybody who won a solar project quoting Rs 2.50 per unit in the past would find it very difficult to execute it as on current module prices those projects are financially not viable,  he further added.Jain recommended a better domestic manufacturing capacity and local supply chain to cool panel prices. Solar panel prices are still hovering around 30-32 Cents per Watt peak, and taking into account factors like Rupee depreciation the tariff of Rs 2.50 per unit becomes unviable. So, the solution is to build a local supply chain and domestic manufacturing capacity to bring down panel prices,  he said.On the governments's new PIL scheme worth Rs 24,000 crore, Jain said its impact will be seen only after 3-5 years which will be challenging for building capacities while the supply chain is disrupted.  The only way forward is to have a remunerative tariff. Otherwise, at the current tariff level, it is not viable to produce solar power. It will be viable at the lower tariff only when the domestic supply chain is in place,  he said.As part of his strategy to build a local supply chain, Jain recently acquired a 700 MW thermal power plant, Ind-Barath Energy (Utkal), through the NCLT. He plans to use the facility to make polysilicon and wafers and ingots.  Once that is done -- and the rest of the supply chain is available in the country -- we will have access to solar panels at much lower prices, making our project cost competitive. But this will take around three years and till then there will be some uncertainty which can only be mitigated with higher tariffs,  he summed up.",

We are engaged with the government,  the person said.  The moment the land is allotted, we will go full throttle on executing the project. The project may require an investment of \u20b95,000 crore and take about three years to finish after the allotment of land.The proposed plant will help meet in-house electricity demand as well as allow the company to sell power on the market.With just 153 MW of wind and 31 MW of solar generation capacity, ONGC barely has a presence today in the renewable energy space. But it has now begun to act on its green goals by pushing hard on some projects and by tying up with some power companies. 95189715ONGC is exploring an offshore wind farm project in partnership with Norway's Equinor. It has struck a preliminary agreement with NTPC, the country's largest generator, for setting up renewable power projects.It has also tied up with Greenko, one of the largest renewable energy companies in India, to set up a green hydrogen project.ONGC and other oil companies in India have been under pressure to go big on the green agenda to help in the climate fight and meet the growing energy needs of the country. India's oil production has been falling for years and the near absence of foreign investments in the upstream sector means domestic players must do more to boost domestic output.High oil and gas prices have helped boost cashflows at ONGC, further pressurising it to look for more investment opportunities. Executives at ONGC feel that the domestic demand for oil and gas is not going to vanish for several decades but it's important to participate in the green energy sector to help fight climate change.",

        "articleBody": "Odia woman gets PM's praise for making solar energy medium of employment Bhubaneswar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday praised Odia woman Kunni Deori who has made solar energy a medium of employment for herself and others.  In his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat, Modi also hailed the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bhubaneswar, for developing a battery-operated portable ventilator for newborn babies, that can be used in remote areas.  While talking about innovation and research, the Prime Minister gave the example of Deori of Odisha's Keonjhar district.   Kunni Deori, a daughter from Odisha, is making solar energy a medium of employment for her as well as for other women. Kunni lives in Kardapal village of Keonjhar district of Odisha. She trains tribal women to spin silk on a solar-powered reeling machine,  Modi said.  As the machine is solar-powered, these tribal women do not have to bear the burden of electricity bills, and they are earning money, he said.   This is the very boon of Sun God's solar energy. The more the boon and the blessings spread, the better it is. Therefore, I urge you to join this and add others too,  the PM said.  Modi also praised the IIT Bhubaneswar as it has developed a portable ventilator for newborn babies.   It runs on battery and can be used easily in remote areas. This can prove to be very helpful in saving the lives of babies who are born prematurely.   Many of our students are engaged in developing new technology - be it electric mobility, drone technology or 5G. Several IITs are also working together on a multilingual project that makes learning local languages easier,  the Prime Minister said.",

        "articleBody": "Borosil Renewables Ltd, India's first solar glass manufacturer has recently acquired 86% stake in Europe's largest solar glass manufacturer Interfloat Group for an undisclosed sum of money. The company said in a statement,  With its acquisition of the Interfloat Group, BRL's solar glass manufacturing capacity will grow to 750 tonnes per day from the current 450 TPD, an increase of 66% .  The combined entity capacity will further increase to 1,300 TPD by year end with the commissioning of a new furnace with a capacity of 550 TDP in India.   This acquisition will make a wider range of solar glass available to BRL's expanded customer base in Europe. Borosil leverages its highly efficient production technology to bring greater productivity and a lower carbon footprint to the European entity,  it said.  Interfloat Group consists of two companies, GMB Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg GmbH (GMB), based in Tschernitz, Germany, and Interfloat Corporation, based in Liechtenstein. GMB is the largest producer of textured tempered solar glass in Europe with a current manufacturing capacity of 300 TPD. It has manufactured glass for Europe's solar (solar PV as well as solar thermal) and greenhouse glass markets since 2008.   With this acquisition, BRL's combined manufacturing capacity in India and Europe would be available to meet a wide range of requirements including sizes varying textures, coatings, dimensions, and thickness. This acquisition will also accelerate investments in new products and technology development benefiting customers,  the statement said.  BRL plans to add further capacity with the next expansion growing to 2,100 TPD in 2024.   Borosil is committed to investing in manufacturing in Europe and will be increasing capacity at GMB's Tschernitz plant at an appropriate time in the near future. This means that BRL and Interfloat will be able to supply significantly higher volumes of solar glass to their present and new customers by improving the serviceability as a result of the production from two locations now,  it said.  Pradeep Kheruka, Executive Chairman of Borosil Renewables Ltd, said,  The extreme crisis now being faced not only in Europe but across the world from sudden disruption in the supply of natural gas has given great impetus to the urgent requirement for solar installations. The demand for domestically manufactured solar PV modules has increased significantly leading to a higher demand for solar glass by our European customers.    In the light of substantial expansion in our capacity in India, we expect to enhance the reliability of our supply chains for our customers. We believe that by leveraging the existing synergies and several complementary skill sets offered by the two companies, we will be able to serve our customers better. We continue to strongly believe that this acquisition moves us closer to our vision of being the most customer-centric company in the world,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "Just six months ago, New Delhi-based Avdesh Kumar was a painter struggling to find enough work. Now, the newly-trained solar technician's phone pings with several job requests each day. Having recently joined renewable power company SunEdison, Kumar is a key link between India's growing number of rooftop solar providers and citizens switching to green energy at home.  Until a few months back ... I didn't know this was even a job and that there was demand for it,  the 34-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from his home in India's capital.  But now I have four or five client visits a day,  Kumar said, explaining how using SunEdison's app has helped him meet growing demand for maintenance work from rooftop solar panel owners to keep their standalone systems functioning efficiently. It is one of a few such digital platforms - including AHA Solar Rooftop Helper, SunPro+ and the Surya Mitra app - that have sprung up to match solar maintenance experts in search of work with customers who need cleaning and repair services. Providing such services more efficiently is considered essential to help promote and meet the targets of India's renewable energy push, which is aiming to move the South Asian country away from its reliance on fossil fuels including coal. This month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed a major clean energy project to make Modhera in western Gujarat state the nation's first 24/7 solar-powered village, with citizens producing their own electricity from 1,300 rooftop systems. The key to the project's success - and ensuring sustained power generation - will depend on good maintenance of the systems, researchers say, pointing to numerous examples of poor after-sales service resulting in defunct rooftop solar projects.  In villages, if a battery becomes defunct, the solar lamps connected to it switch off and remain that way,  said Aviram Sharma, assistant professor at Bihar's Nalanda University, who has carried out research on solar micro-grids in rural areas. Remote villages lack shops where people can get a solar system repaired, unlike with mobile phones, he said.  As a result, it stops working forever,  Sharma added. India has fallen behind on its goal to install 40 gigawatts (GW) of rooftop solar power capacity by the end of 2022. An April report by consultancy firm JMK Research and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a non-profit, projected a 25GW deficit in capacity this year. The high cost of installing solar systems - which can range from 40,000 to 80,000 Indian rupees ($482-964) for a 1-kilowatt system - has deterred many would-be consumers, providers say. For the steadily growing numbers of rooftop solar owners across India, meanwhile, keeping them working is the main worry.  Our market survey has shown that early adopters of rooftop solar have had very bad experiences,  said Vivek Kumar, who heads operations and maintenance at SunEdison.  No one is selling the experience of going solar to a consumer. It is sold as a one-time investment which ends with installation. Maintenance is not discussed,  he added. 'FLY BY NIGHT' A vital pillar of India's renewable energy push is to create a workforce that can operate the solar and wind plants being set up across the country to meet rising demand for electricity. However, six years since the inception of a national skills programme, less than a third of the nearly 80,000 participants trained to install solar panels, connect them to grids and maintain batteries have found jobs, government data shows. Meanwhile, residents find it hard to get their solar energy systems fixed when they have a problem, consumer groups say.  There are still a number of fly-by-night operators who install a rooftop system and then disappear,  said K. Vishnu Mohan Rao, senior researcher with the non-profit Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group. The problem is exacerbated by a fragmented supply chain - with various parts being made by different companies, he added. In Gujarat, which accounts for more than 80% of India's rooftop solar installations, physical stores are not visible in any of the state's cities, said Pulkit Dhingra, founder and director of AHA! Solar, a firm providing solar tech solutions.  In many cases, companies are mandated to maintain the system for five years, but they don't see value in it,  he said.  In the hyper-competitive market, with small profit margins, the focus is just (on) installation,  added Dhingra, whose company also helps Gujarat implement the state's solar policy. In rural India, where solar energy is used for powering water pumps, lighting health centres, homes and schools, the lack of a directory of solar technicians makes the situation worse, according to researchers.  It involves days of trying to contact vendors (and) video calls on patchy networks to try and explain the problem to a technician located in a city,  said Dheeraj Kumar Gupta, a senior energy programme associate with the World Resources Institute India, a research organisation. Even if an annual maintenance contract is signed when a solar rooftop system is installed, it is often not fulfilled as villages are too far away for technicians to visit, with local electricians instead hired when a quick fix is needed, he added. WAY FORWARD India's federal government and states are trying to wean themselves off fossil fuels to meet climate targets as public awareness of global warming grows and electricity gets pricier. In Gujarat, Rajendra Mistry, chief project officer of the state's power corporation, is charged with documenting lessons from the 24/7 solar-powered project in Modhera.  The learnings from this project will shape the planning for many more in the pipeline,  Mistry said in an interview. The two main challenges in the rooftop solar sector are finance and maintenance, he said. In the case of Modhera, the government covered all the costs while a company has been contracted to keep the systems in good working order. Kumar of SunEdison, meanwhile, is monitoring the growth of his company's app, which matches solar technicians with customers in 83 Indian cities.  The industry is ready to explode and it makes sense to have a handy workforce ready to grow alongside,  he said. Although consumer forums have flagged privacy concerns around the increasing use of such apps and obstacles to adoption such as poor mobile internet connections in rural areas, they have provided consistent work for people such as Avdesh Kumar. He uploads pictures of himself in safety gear, as well as the work he has completed, to show SunEdison he is doing a good job and following the protocols correctly.  I am also part of a growing group of technicians and we share our knowledge,  he said.  It makes me learn and grow.  ",

        "articleBody": "The government has excluded solar power projects from the list of goods that can avail of a concessional 7.5% import duty under the project imports scheme, a move criticised by solar power developers. The government said the exclusion plugged a loophole that allowed developers to bypass the 40% import duty imposed on solar projects to encourage local manufacturing.Solar power developers said the decision is a major setback to the country's solar power capacity addition plan and they might consider legal options opposing the differential treatment as only solar power plants have been excluded. MNRE (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy) is working on measures to provide relief to the industry. It is hopeful of relief in the near future,  a government official told ET.The 40% duty on solar power projects came into effect in April. 94997063People aware of the issue said the government is considering giving a one-year extension for commissioning solar projects affected by the non-availability of modules after the imposition of duty and costly imports.It is also exploring ways to exempt solar projects bid out before the announcement of the higher customs duty in March last year On Wednesday, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs issued the Project Imports (Amendment) Regulations, 2022 that excluded solar plants from the concessional import duty scheme. The scheme allows the import of equipment for new industrial units at a concessional rate of 7.5%, revised upwards from 5% from October 1. This is a big setback to the solar industry. There have been advance rulings that solar is also a power generation project like other generation projects and falls under the same bracket. This specific exclusion is arbitrary,  said an industry official.A government official countered saying solar power developers were resorting to Project Imports Regulations, 1986, to avoid Basic Customs Duty on the import of solar photovoltaic cells and modules, defeating the government's target to raise indigenous manufacturing. In past many solar power producers have been taking the benefit of concessional rate of customs duty under the Project Import scheme. With the exclusion of solar projects from the scheme the cost of modules would likely increase by 33%-34%,  said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner, EY.",

        "articleBody": "At the Fifth Assembly of the International Solar Alliance, being held in New Delhi, member countries are putting in place the key pieces that are necessary for wider adoption of solar energy. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was set up at the Paris UN climate summit in 2015 as an organisation that is focused on implementation. Proposals for a payment guarantee mechanism, a system for improving capacity, and supporting the creation of an ecosystem that will build an economy around solar energy applications were taken up by the Assembly.\u201cWe now have a fair understanding of what countries want, of course the needs vary from country to country but broadly we can put it into three main baskets: advocacy, capacity, and finance,\u201d said Ajay Mathur, director general of the International Solar Alliance.As part of the advocacy effort to help governments explain to their domestic constituencies on the need to focus on solar, the ISA is focusing on providing information. \u201cFrom this year, we will bring out annual reports detailing the progress in solar technologies, solar markets and solar investments,\u201d said Mathur. These reports will be in addition to the \u201cEase of Doing Solar\u201d that ISA has been bringing out annually.  94952840With the need to transition away from carbon-heavy energy systems becoming more evident, ISA is focusing on ensuring that solar becomes an alternative of choice. The economics are in favour of solar energy. \u201cOur studies indicate that solar plus storage will be the cheapest form of electricity in most parts of the world by 2030, and a further 40 to 60 per cent cost decline is expected by 2050,\u201d the ISA DG explained. What that means is that the solar infrastructure that would make it possible for countries to take advantage of the cheaper, cleaner energy source must be put in place now. This is where the situation gets a bit challenging. \u201cFreight price increases are a huge problem. Freight prices have increased by 40 per cent in the last year and this has led to a 15 to 20 per cent increase in prices of solar. Solar prices that have been declining constantly are now showing an increase. What this means is that solar supply chains will need to be shorter. That would mean new capacity will have to be added across the world.,\u201d explained Mathur. While this situation holds the promise of job creation, the setting up of new capacities across the world also presents a challenge: cost. \u201cThe lower prices are from existing capacities but setting up new capacities will mean higher costs and prices, the question then is who will meet the difference?\u201d Mathur refers to the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the PLI schemes in India as examples of government interventions to address the issue of costs. \u201cAny country that is desirous of developing new manufacturing capacity will have to put in place some instrument to support it.\u201d As part of the advocacy efforts, ISA is looking into the kind of instruments that have been used, how countries have used these instruments, and the kind of interventions that have worked.The second set of issues pertains to capacity building. Mathur says a recurring theme that emerges in his discussions with leaders and governments is around the question of the human resource and know-how for capitalizing on the solar option. \u201cWe are working with various training organisations to provide training which will lead to certification. Local industries tell us about the kind of people they need and what information these people should have. We train the people, provide them the required information and skills and certify them so that they can be hired by local industry.\u201dThe third critical area relates to finance. In 2021, $200 billion was invested in solar globally. Mathur points out that 74 per cent of this went to China and OECD countries, while only 5 per cent was invested in Africa. \u201cThink about it, Africa is the continent with the largest demand growth and the best solar intensity, yet it gets just a miniscule fraction of the huge amount that is invested globally.\u201d Mathur said that they spoke to about 100 investors to understand why the best opportunities were attracting the least amount of investment. \u201cThere were many issues that were highlighted but the most important one was investors saying \u2018we need to get our money back\u2019. There is a perception of risk.\u201d This perception is exacerbated by the paucity of projects, sometimes it is a single project in a country\u2014which makes the transaction cost too high for an investor.To this end, Mathur said ISA has proposed a payment guarantee scheme. A facility that will support projects by reducing lenders\u2019 apprehensions and enabling finance to flow for projects that otherwise may not have received funding. The payment guarantee fund will only provide a partial guarantee. With minimal default, the guarantee fund would enable investments in geographies that do not receive investments.Mathur is hopeful that these measures will reduce the implementation gap, and help countries particularly poor developing countries to make the transition to a solar energy based clean economy.",

        "articleBody": "Corporate funding in the global solar sector declined by 18 per cent year-on-year to USD 18.7 billion in January-September 2022, according to a Mercom Capital report. Corporate funding includes venture capital and private equity (VC), debt financing, and public market financing.   Total corporate funding in 9M 2022 (first nine months) stood at USD 18.7 billion, 18 per cent lower compared to USD 22.8 billion raised in 9M 2021. The number of deals increased 17 per cent y-o-y, with 131 in 9M 2022 compared to 112 in 9M 2021,  the global clean energy consulting firm said in its report.  During January-September 2022, venture capital (VC) funding activity rose 150 per cent to USD 5.5 billion with 72 deals compared to the USD 2.2 billion raised in 39 deals in the same period last year.  In India, Navitas Alpha Renewables raised around 870,000 in seed round of funding. Renkube also secured around USD 300,000 in seed funding. While Prescinto Technologies raised USD 6.5 million in financing, Aerem raised USD 2.5 million in pre-Series A funding and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and the Hero Group plan to invest USD 450 million in Hero Future Energies (HFE), the renewable energy arm of the Hero Group.  Globally, the announced solar debt financing activity in the first nine months of 2022 totaled USD 8.3 billion in 48 deals, a rise of 42 per cent lower than USD 14.2 billion raised during January-September 2021 across 50 deals.  In India, Husk Power Systems, a distributed utility company that provides reliable power to rural communities and businesses entirely from renewable energy sources, signed a debt facility of USD 6 million from the EU-funded Electrification Financing Initiative.   Corporate funding is behind pace y-o-y, impacted by inflation and high-interest rates but is still ahead compared to the previous six years. There is renewed momentum after the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (of the US). We have seen a resurgence in VC and private equity funding, breaking funding records since 2010,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.",

Our module capacities have more than doubled in the last seven-and-a-half years. They are now 20 Gw, but the same cannot be said about the cells, which is 4.5 Gw,  he said, speaking at an event on Aatmanirbhar Bharat organized by the CII. But the minister indicated that it was going to change, considering the projects under PLI-1 and now PLI-2. Scheme guidelines for PLI-2 have already been published, he said.By 2026, India is aiming at capacities of 38 Gw in polysilicons, 56 Gw in ingot and wafers, 70-80 Gw in cells and 90-100 Gw in modules, Chaturvedi said. Our targets are huge, if you consider 500 Gw plans we have, which does not take into account the hydrogen plans, then we have to install approximately 25-35 Gw every year, so the capacities we are planning to install will also be able to cater to this, but also to the hydrogen demand and something remaining for exports. So, the outlook for solar manufacturing seems good,  the minister added.Power and renewable energy minister RK Singh said the government is considering giving deemed distribution licences in the renewable energy space.He stressed on the need to generate green hydrogen instead of decarbonised hydrogen. He said some developed countries have proposed decarbonised hydrogen which may involve methane and carbon-dioxide emissions.  Is the developed world serious about energy transition? We are. You had a disruption in gas supplies, you switched to coal. I received proposals on decarbonised hydrogen. What is that? Why decarbonised hydrogen? Before this there was a theory that gas is not very polluting,  Singh said, adding  hypocrisy will not work .India, which has 42% non-fossil fuel capacity as of 2021, will expand that to 65% by 2030, he said.",

The MoU was signed in Jaipur in the presence of Union Minister for Coal, Mines & Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi and Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. Speaking on the occasion, Joshi said that India has sufficient coal reserves to last for up to 50 years. The emphasis now is to produce clean coal and steps are being taken in this direction. He said eight million tonne stocks are available at present and the state government must go for innovative solutions to ease out transport bottlenecks, according to an official statement released by the Ministry of Coal. Joshi said that for transportation of coal now rail cum sea route is preferred so that the transportation time is reduced. The Minister said that steps are being taken to resolve the energy issues of all the states and the Prime Minister's vision for New India will be realised when energy needs of all states get fulfilled and they get developed. The proposed project, for which the MoU was inked by Pramod Agrawal, Chairman, CIL and Rajesh Kumar Sharma, CMD, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RRVUN), will come up in Rajasthan's upcoming solar park cleared under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks. It would boost CIL's pursuit of solar power generation as part of its diversification programme for clean coal energy. The project would begin in a phased manner and is expected to be an employment generator in the state apart from providing cleaner power. Bhanwar Singh Bhati, Minister of State for Power (Independent Charge), Government of Rajasthan, A K Jain, Secretary, Ministry of Coal, Government of India and Usha Sharma, Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan were also present on the occasion.

        "articleBody": "Coal India Ltd (CIL) will set up a 1,190-MW solar power plant in Bikaner district of Rajasthan.For this, CIL has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of Rs 5,400 crore with the Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd (RUVNL) in the presence of Union Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot in Jaipur.Speaking at the programme, Union coal minister Joshi said that sufficient reserves of coal are available in the country and adequate coal supply will be ensured to states as per their requirement.He said that alternate options for the transportation of coal via road and sea are also being provided to states to ensure smooth transportation of coal.Joshi said that the central government has laid special emphasis on promoting renewable energy generation. Along with this, by adopting new technology, the government is also working towards producing electricity from coal without pollution,  he said.Joshi said that per capita electricity consumption in the country will almost double by 2040 and to meet future needs, there is a need to pay special attention to electricity generation from renewable sources.Chief minister Gehlot said that the state government has always encouraged renewable energy resources. With the establishment of solar park, uninterrupted power supply can be made to the common man along with saving coal and reducing pollution,  he said.Gehlot said that the work of production and assembly of necessary equipment for setting up solar power plants should be done in the state itself in order to pass on the benefits of increasing investment in the field of solar energy to the people of the state in terms of employment and development.The chief minister said that the coal supply has been affected due to the interruption of mining in the coal mines allotted to Chhattisgarh, but the number of coal rakes available to the state has been increased in coordination with the central government and Coal India. We have a captive coal mine problem in Chhattisgarh. We are not getting all the coal from them. I thank all of you for meeting the shortage of coal in Rajasthan at such a time,  he said.Gehlot also welcomed the withdrawal of the order given by the central government to the states to import coal. This has also reduced the economic burden on the state,  he added.Gehot said that the national target of developing 500 GW capacity renewable energy by 2029-30 would be achieved only with good coordination between the central and state governments.He said that the state has made exemplary progress in the field of power supply despite these difficulties. While only 13 MW of electricity was available in Rajasthan at the time of independence, today more than 23,000 MW of electricity is being produced in the state.The solar plant of CIL will be set up in a 2,000-MW solar park being developed by RVUNL in Poogal, Bikaner.The state government has allotted 4,846 hectares land to develop the park in which the RVUNL will set up its own solar project of 810 MW, and a power project of 1,190 will be set up by the CIL.Chairman and Managing Director of RVUNL R K Sharma and CIL's Technical Director V Reddy signed the MoU.",

        "articleBody": "The Karnataka High Court has rejected the plea of Hinduja Renewables Two Private Limited to put up a solar plant to be built at an estimated cost of Rs 146 crore on a disputed land in Raichur district of the state. The bench of Justice C M Poonacha upheld a lower court order which had directed the Mumbai-based company not to put up permanent structures as a property dispute among family members was pending. In its recent judgement, the HC noted that the  conduct of the appellant/company is not entirely free from blemish . It also noted that the company proceeded with the sale deed after the lower court's orders and obtained permissions and other documents after the property dispute arose in the court. It said,  The trial court after noticing the case of the parties, has recorded a categorical finding of fact that the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case and also held that it is the plaintiffs who will be put to loss and hardship in getting their share, if defendant no.6 (company) proceeds with the construction work.  The company had approached the HC against the order passed by the Court of the Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Sindhanur in Raichur district on January 14, 2022. Two minors -- Rahul Patil and Ankitha, both children of late Malleshgouda -- had approached the lower court seeking one-sixth share in the joint-family property managed by their grandfather. It was alleged that after the death of Malleshgouda, the grandfather and his other children entered into an agreement with the company, to put up a solar power plant on their property at Mallata village in the district. The two children claimed that 35 acres of the total property was their share. Pending the resolution of the dispute, the lower court ordered that the company should not put up any permanent structure in the disputed property. The company approached the HC and claimed that it had carried out due diligence for putting up the solar plant. It was putting up a 26 megawatt electricity generation plant at a cost of Rs 146 crore. All necessary permissions from the government were in place, the court was told. After the lower court had passed its order on January 14, 2022, the company had proceeded with the registration of the sale deed on April 4, 2022. It then filed the appeal in the high court  after a lapse of nearly six months.  The HC noted that  several documents executed by and/or in favour of the company with regard to the commissioning of its project, are subsequent to the suit filed by the plaintiffs.  Dismissing the company's appeal, the HC said the company has failed in demonstrating as to how the finding recorded by the trial court is illegal or perverse and requires interference in this appeal.",

Big day for Modhera as it takes a giant leap towards harnessing solar power,  said PM Modi, while addressing a huge gathering at Modhera. Now, people of Modhera need not pay for electricity but they can start selling it and earn from it, asserted the Prime Minister. Till a while back, the government used to supply electricity to citizens but now, with the installation of solar panels, citizens will produce their own electricity, said PM Modi.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said that the people of the state have blessed him for the last two decades and voted for him irrespective of his caste. People of Gujarat have blessed me for the last two decades without looking at my caste, without looking at my political background. Before becoming the prime minister, Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat between 2001 and 2014.Assembly elections in Gujarat are slated to be held soon. The elections are crucial for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which aims to retain power in PM Modi's home state, while the Congress hopes for a win after remaining out of power for 27 years in the state. What you need to know about ModheraModhera is famous for its Sun temple, which is situated on the river Pushpavati. It was built by King Bhima-I of the Chaulukya dynasty in 1026-27. According to the Gujarat government, which shared information in a series of tweets, over 1000 solar panels have been installed on the village houses, generating electricity round the clock for the villagers. Significantly they will be provided with solar electricity at zero cost.The Gujarat government has said that it has ensured the sustainable implementation of various welfare projects in Gujarat, keeping in mind the Prime Minister's vision of increasing the use of renewable energy in India.",

        "articleBody": "Tata Power on Friday announced its plans to develop around 10,000 MW of renewable energy capacity, mainly solar energy, in the next five years in Rajasthan.  Tata Power plans to have a renewable power portfolio of 10,000 MW in the state (Rajasthan in next five years,  a company statement said.  Participating in the ongoing Invest Rajasthan summit in Jaipur, it stated that it plans to develop up to 8,000 MW of utility scale projects, 1,000 MW of solar rooftop and 1,50,000 solar pumps in next five years in the state.  Tata Power, along with its fully-owned subsidiary Tata Power Solar, will expand its presence in the state to generate clean energy through solar power.  The company employs more than 4,500 people in the state, and its expansion projects will generate employment for more than 6,000-8,000 people in the next five years.  Dr Praveer Sinha, CEO & MD, Tata Power, said in the statement,  Both in terms of potential and what has been done so far, Rajasthan has today emerged as a role model to produce green energy through solar power. I am happy to be here in Invest Rajasthan summit. With its already strong footprint in the state, Tata Power is fully poised to make Rajasthan future-ready and realise its full potential and emerge as a green power house of the country. We will continue to build on all three business -- EPC, solar pump and solar rooftop -- to the benefit of farmers, industries and common citizens of this frontier state.   Rajasthan is an important state for Tata Power's renewable business. It presently has a portfolio of 4,939 MWp. Till date, Tata Power has commissioned 2,066 MW in Rajasthan and around 2,873 MW capacity of solar projects are under construction, which will be completed in next 12-24 months.  T P Ajmer Distribution Ltd, a unit of Tata Power, has completed 5 years of operations and has enhanced consumer experience in Ajmer.  Tata Power has ensured safe and reliable supply in Ajmer and also achieved AT&C (Aggregate Technical and Commercial) loss reduction from 22 per cent to 9 per cent.  With the support and favourable policies of the government of Rajasthan, the company is looking forward to opportunities of power distribution in various other cities of the state under the collaborative Public Private Partnership (PPP) model and to serve the citizens of Rajasthan with quality power supply.  With respect to solar pumps, Tata Power plans to set up around 1,50,000 pumps in next five years in the state.  The company has so far installed nearly 21,600 solar pumps in Jaipur, Hanumangarh, Ganganagar, Jalore and Bikaner.  Tata Power through its rooftop services has a cumulative installed capacity of 65 MW in Rajasthan.  The company has been doing extensive work for industrial belts like marble, granite and stone crushing etc in Rajasthan located in regions like Ajmer, Sirohi, Rajsamand, Jalore and Makrana.  Through its various rooftop offerings, Tata Power has installed over 20 MW of rooftop for these industries. These installations have resulted in cumulative savings of about Rs 20 crore per annum for customers.  Tata Power is also working towards setting up a robust EV charging infrastructure in the state to enable faster transition towards electric mobility. The company has installed over 1,100 home chargers and 100 public chargers in Rajasthan.  In the next few years, Tata Power plans to install 10,000 public EV charging points in the state.",

Combining all ongoing and future investments, we anticipate investing an additional Rs 65,000 crore in Rajasthan over the next 5 to 7 years and creating over 40,000 direct and indirect jobs,  said Adani at the Invest Rajasthan 2022 Summit.The company already has a sizeable presence in the state where it operates a thermal power plant, has set up a solar park and supplies coal to the state's power-generating units.It also operates city gas infrastructure for retailing compressed natural gas (CNG) to automobiles and piped gas to households and industries as well as laying transmission lines to carry renewable power. Adani Group is investing ?50,000 crore to add 10,000 megawatts of renewable power generation capacity. This will be commissioned progressively over the next 5 years,  he said, adding the group achieved commercial operation of the world's largest wind-solar hybrid power plant in Rajasthan, last week.Additionally, it is looking to double its cement manufacturing capacity following its acquisition of Ambuja Cements and ACC. While we already have three cement plants and limestone mining assets, a significant part of our capacity expansion will continue to happen in Rajasthan. We anticipate investing another ?7,000 crore to double our cement manufacturing capacity in the state,  he said.The Group is also the operator of Jaipur airport which will be expanded, he said.Adani said the group is betting on green hydrogen, given its ability to generate the most inexpensive solar and wind power.  I believe this opportunity to generate green hydrogen to transform Rajasthan's deserts into 'an oasis of jobs enabling energy transition' is an opportunity that no other state has,  he said.The group has already invested over ?35,000 crore across multiple industrial sectors in Rajasthan across a 1,320 megawatt (MW) Kawai power plant and a 10,000 MW solar park that produces 1,500 MW of green power. It has also invested ?20,000 crore in commissioning over 4,000 MW of renewable projects.The group supplies coal to over 4,300 MW of state thermal plants and also operates high-voltage transmission lines, a dry port container terminal in Kishangarh and two edible oil manufacturing plants in Alwar and Bundi.",

        "articleBody": "The increasing need for cost savings and growing awareness among residential consumers, along with a strong push by the Central government, is helping accelerate the pace of rooftop solar installations in India's residential segment, a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research & Analytics said on Thursday.Gujarat, Haryana and Maharashtra are the three most attractive states for residential rooftop solar installations. This shows that the potential for rooftop solar installations in residential spaces is huge in India. We expect the growth of residential rooftop solar installations to accelerate in the near term across India because of the strong policy push and resurgent market demand,  says the report's co-author Vibhuti Garg, Director, South Asia, IEEFA. The Indian residential rooftop solar segment is at the cusp of a robust growth phase. From the 2 gigawatts (GW) cumulative installed capacity as of fiscal year (FY) 2022, the residential market will likely reach 3.2GW by FY2023. Regarding demand-side drivers, the report highlights that there has been a key change brought about in consumer behaviour and demands after Covid-19. The lack of consumer awareness had been one of the major impediments to adoption, especially in the pre-Covid era. However, post-Covid, there has been a strong surge in demand, backed by enhanced consciousness about cost savings, the environment, etc.,  says co-author Jyoti Gulia, Founder, JMK Research. Interestingly, while the pace of the solarisation of India's residential segment has been underwhelming, the country has been the world's least expensive residential solar power market for about a decade. In 2020, the average cost of a residential rooftop solar system in India was $658 per kilowatt (kW), declining by 73 per cent from the 2013 level. In comparison, in 2020, the residential rooftop solar cost in leading residential markets, such as Japan, the UK, Switzerland and the US, was 3.3x to 6.4x that of India.The report adds the Central government's recent push by launching a single national digital portal to simplify the process of residential rooftop solar installations and formalising a direct benefit transfer mechanism will boost capacity addition. The new Central Financial Assistance (CFA) scheme will allow residential consumers to buy rooftop solar systems from any registered supplier of their choice. This broadens consumers' options for quality products and services,  says co-author Prabhakar Sharma, Senior Research Associate, JMK Research.While initiatives by the Central government are positive developments, the report also finds that some policy hurdles persist at the state level.For example, the state governments must resolve issues such as delays in net metering approvals and proper communication of the benefits of rooftop solar installations. Sometimes, state electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) delay subsidy payments to the installers, disrupting the latter's working capital flow. Concerning the residential solar regulations, all state electricity distribution companies must grant net metering approvals to the consumers within a strict and short timeline. In the case of residential rooftop solar systems, DISCOMs, in general, need to be restricted to carrying out two activities: inspecting solar plants and selling the net meters,  says co-author Akhil Thayillam, Senior Research Associate, JMK Research.In addition to policy hurdles, some other challenges that the residential rooftop solar segment currently faces are increasing overall system costs (in the past couple of years) and weak financing support.To better understand the states that are performing better in attracting residential rooftop solar installations, the report also provides a State-Wise Attractiveness Index for Residential Rooftop Solar Sector.",

The company was listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange between 2007 and 2018.   We would at some point be keen to come back to markets like London,  Greenko co-founder Mahesh Kolli said at the Reuters IMPACT climate conference in London on Tuesday.  India's renewable energy capacity is currently around 100 gigawatts. It will need soon to add another 400 gigawatts to achieve its climate goal of half of the nation's energy sourced from renewables by 2030.  Kolli said he saw Greenko supporting this effort, with the company adding 50 gigawatt hours of storage capacity by 2025.   The whole energy transition has huge limitations without storage,  he said.  Since 2018, we have focused on how to make long duration energy storage economical and scalable.   Finding economic parity with coal, he added, was critical.",

        "articleBody": "Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to develop solar rooftop projects on government and semi-government buildings and offices in the state as part of its new renewable energy initiative.The department of New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (NEDA), the nodal body, has already invited online bids from prospective bidders for designing, manufacturing, supply, erecting, testing, and commissioning of 25-2,000 kw grid-connected solar PV projects on government buildings and offices.The selected contractors will also be responsible for maintaining and operating the rooftop solar projects for 25 years.According to the government spokesman, 'NEDA has also invited a pre-bid conference on October 10 to take note of suggestions that the prospective bidders may have to make.'The rooftop systems will be implemented as per the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Authority (UPERC) RSPV Regulations, 2019, and its amendments.A rooftop solar PV essentially refers to the grid-interactive solar photovoltaic power system installed on the rooftops of consumer premises that uses sunlight for direct conversion into electricity through photo-voltaic technology.The project is proposed to be executed under the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model on a net-billing/net-metering basis.Under the RESCO model, bidders intend to take a rooftop owned by some other entity on mutually agreed terms and conditions, including a lease agreement, from the rooftop owner(s) and enter into the PPA with the rooftop owner for the supply of solar power for 25 years. As per such agreements, the rooftop owners do not have to make any upfront payment.'The scheme aims to reduce fossil fuel-based electricity and thereby, the carbon footprint. This scheme, with an aggregate capacity of 50 MW throughout the state, envisages installation of grid-connected rooftop solar PV projects,' the spokesman said.",

        "articleBody": "Multi-national solar energy solutions provider Goldi Solar has announced it plans to infuse over Rs 5,000 crore as a part of its business expansion plans, particularly in modules, cells and raw material manufacturing capabilities. It plans to commence production at its cell manufacturing unit in Gujarat.  Goldi Solar is one of the leading Indian solar brands. The company manufactures panels, provides EPC services, and is an independent power producer. Founded in 2011, it is a multinational company headquartered in Gujarat's Surat, catering to several international brands in over 20 countries. It has two facilities of 2.5 GW at Pipodara and Navsari in Gujarat. Subsequently, it will expand its capacity to 5 GW. Goldi Solar also plans to recruit over 4,500 people across various functions, increasing its workforce to over 5,500, including the existing workforce.  To create employment at the grassroots level, Goldi Solar plans to hire 25 per cent of the workforce from the local tribal regions adjoining its proposed manufacturing facility,  said Captain Ishver Dholakiya - Managing Director of Goldi Solar. Goldi Solar will conduct three-month certification programmes at a skill development centre that it plans to open in collaboration with the NSDC (National Skill Development Council) in Navsari to train new recruits for a career in renewables in Gujarat. Terming renewables as the future of energy, the MD said the firm's plans of launching a new product line and expanding capacity for module manufacturing are designed to increase the supply of clean energy and motivate its large-scale replacement of fossil fuel.  At Goldi Solar, we have committed to the Prime Minister's vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and aspire to create an India self-reliant in renewable energy,  Dholakiya added. In India, the country's goal toward 500 GW of non-fossil-fuel energy sources by 2030 could create 3.4 million new job opportunities (of short or long duration), or about 1 million direct full-time equivalents, a joint report published by International Renewable Energy Agency and the International Labour Organization titled 'Renewable Energy and Jobs -- Annual Review 2022' said. In 2020-21, India created 863,000 green jobs, of which 217,000 were in solar photovoltaic vertical and 414,000 in hydropower, the joint report said recently. Jobs in solar photovoltaic (PV) in 2021, the fastest-growing sector, accounted for more than a third of the total renewable energy workforce. India added 10.3 GW of solar PV capacity in 2021, up from 4.2 GW installed in 2020, the joint report said. Worldwide, the solar vertical scored a new record in 2021, producing 132.8 GW of solar PV capacity installations, up from 125.6 GW in 2020, with many countries, including India, setting new annual records. For the record, at the COP26 summit at Glasgow in late 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to an ambitious five-part  Panchamrit  pledge, including reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, to generate half of all energy requirements from renewables, to reduce emissions by 1 billion tons by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070. ",

        "articleBody": "The Cabinet approved an additional \u20b919,500 crore funding on Wednesday for the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacture of high-efficiency solar modules. The government expects this cash support to catalyse investment worth \u20b994,000 crore in a sector that's highly dependent on imports, creating domestic capacity of about 65 GW of fully and partially integrated solar photovoltaic modules.The Cabinet also cleared the National Logistics Policy and approved changes to enhance the incentive structure for manufacture of semiconductors, display fabs and compound semiconductors.The government has issued letters of award to Reliance New Energy Solar, Adani Infrastructure and Shirdi Sai Group for the \u20b94,500-crore first tranche of PLI on National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules.Integrated PlantsRenewable energy secretary Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi said the Cabinet-approved bid design will lead to a capacity of 29 GW of fully integrated manufacturing plants, 18 GW plants integrated from wafers to modules, and 18 GW integrated over cells and modules plants.There are four stages in module making - polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules. India's existing 15 GW production facilities have no polysilicon or wafer production capacity. Domestic Push for Manufacturing  The PLI encourages all the stages - allocating Rs 12,000 crore for fully integrated polysilicon to wafers to cells to modules capacity, Rs 4,500 crore for three-stage integration of wafers to cells to modules, and Rs 3,000 crore for integration across cells and modules. The combined module manufacturing capacity under both PLI tranches is expected to be 74 GW, in addition to 6 GW outside PLI schemes.The incentive scheme is expected to create direct employment for 195,000 persons and for 780,000 indirectly, apart from replacing Rs 1.37 lakh crore of imports, the government said.PLI will be disbursed for five years after commissioning of solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing plants on sales of high-efficiency solar PV modules.Chaturvedi said the government has taken a number of measures, including introducing customs duty, to encourage domestic module manufacturing and there are signs that this is picking up, he said.The country will need 280-300 GW solar energy capacity to achieve the targeted 500 GW of renewable energy generation by 2030.  For the remaining years up to 2030, our domestic requirement will be 30-35 GW of modules,  Chaturvedi said, adding the commissioned capacity will meet domestic as well export requirements.Tata Power managing director Praveer Sinha welcomed the move, saying this will help in import substitution and indigenisation of solar equipment.Effective April 2, the government imposed a 25% customs duty on solar cells to promote domestic manufacturing under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Semiconductor PolicyThe Cabinet cleared modifications to the Programme for Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India, providing a uniform 50% fiscal support to all the three schemes under its umbrella. The Cabinet also removed the Rs 12,000-crore incentive cap for the display fabs scheme, indicating full fiscal support to any eligible investment.The three separate schemes for the manufacture of semiconductors, display fabs and compound semiconductors earlier had varying 30-50% incentives. In the scheme announced in December last year, advanced nodes such as 28 nm stood to attract higher incentives than others such as 65 nm.Vedanta and Foxconn have proposed to set up a semiconductor plant in Gujarat, along with two other applicants.  After today's modifications, the semiconductor policy is extremely competitive and attracts investments across the spectrum, which is silicon, compound and fabs,  said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, minister of state for electronics and IT. National Logistics PolicyThe logistics policy seeks to bring about efficiency in logistics services and will complement the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan. The vision is to develop a technologically enabled, integrated, cost-efficient, resilient, sustainable and trusted logistics ecosystem for accelerated and inclusive growth,  the government said.The targets include a reduction in logistics costs to global benchmarks and a top 25 ranking in the global Logistics Performance Index by 2030, as well as creating a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem.",

        "articleBody": "In 2015, the government of India had set the target of achieving 100 gigawatt (GW) of grid-connected solar installation by 2022. Now, with less than four months to the deadline of the solar target, India stares at an installation gap of ~39 GW, according to JMC Research.The 100 GW target comprises of 40 GW for grid-connected rooftop and 60 GW for grid-connected utility-scale projects. Till August 31, 2022, the cumulative grid-connected solar power capacity of India stands at ~61 GW, the report said.  The gap in terms of installed capacity for rooftop and utility-scale segments from their respective targets are 69% and 18% respectively, as of August 2022. The underwhelming progress of rooftop solar installation can be attributed to low consumer awareness and inadequate supply-side infrastructure,  the report added.In the first 8 months of 2022, India added a total of 8 GW of grid-connected solar capacity. Further, as per JMK Research estimates, in the last 4 months of 2022, India is likely to add 7 GW of solar capacity.  Thus, it is expected that the nation would reach a total grid-connected solar installation of 68 GW by 2022.  94330436 In the short-term, extending the effective date of approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) by 6-12 months is imperative. This would help in revitalizing the highly-constrained corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) market including the open access and net metering segments. And albeit the 2022 solar target may not be fulfilled, it is necessary that, in the long-term, India bolster the growth and development of its solar market for enhancing its energy security and aatmanirbharta (self-reliance).

Viraj Profile Private Limited (VPPL) is a stainless steel manufacturer, which owns and operates a plant located at Tarapur at Nandgaon. In a statement, Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited (TPREL) said,  It has collaborated with VPL to set up a 100 MW captive solar plant. The plant is expected to generate about 200 MUs of energy and offset approximately 170.43 million Kg of CO2 annually. With the commissioning of this plant, Viraj Profile's dependability on non-renewable power resources will be reduced by approximately 50 per cent . The project is expected to be commissioned by July 2023, TPREL said without sharing any financial details of the project. According to industry estimates, to set up every 1 MW of solar capacity, an investment of over Rs 4.5 crore is required. TPREL further said it has created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) named TP Nanded Limited, which will undertake the construction, operation and maintenance of this captive solar power plant. As per captive generation rules, Tata Power will own 74 per cent of the generation, while Viraj Profile will own the remaining 26 per cent.  We announce the establishment of our new SPV to construct a 100 MW solar power facility for Viraj Profile Private Limited. This project is another step in TPREL's ongoing efforts to build green and renewable energy solutions throughout India,  said Ashish Khanna, CEO, of Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited. JP Garg, President, Viraj Profiles, said,  Viraj is one of the first stainless steel long products manufacturing companies in India, which will use solar energy to run its manufacturing plants and operations. This Solar Power project will supply 50 per cent of our monthly electricity requirement .",

Virescent is the only infrastructure trust (InvIT) in India in the renewable energy space, it said in a statement.  Virescent completed the acquisition of one of the three projects -- 12.4 MW project at Lalitpur -- earlier this month.  Jakson Group owns and operates around 200MW of solar portfolio across four projects. It had recently announced the commissioning of a 70MW project in Assam.  It recently announced its new venture Jakson Green Pvt Ltd (JGPL) which will focus on green energy.   With the conclusion of this transaction, VRET (Virescent) will come closer to its aim of achieving a 1.5GW portfolio of assets in the initial phase of its growth over the next two-three years.   Virescent will expand its diversified portfolio of operational renewable energy assets by identifying investment opportunities that have stable cash flows stemming from long-term contracts with state and central government-owned power utilities across India,  he added.  Earlier, Virescent had acquired assets from Shapoorji, Focal Sindicatum and Godawari Power, and Ispat. The Jakson acquisition would take Virescent's total operational solar capacity to 600MW.  The AUM (asset under management) of Virescent as of March 31, 2022, stands at around Rs 3,850 crore which will go to Rs 4,250 crore with Jakson acquisition.",

        "articleBody": "One of the prominent challenges of the 21st century is how to make aviation sustainability a reality in the face of the industrys high global footprints. In this modern world, transportation by air has become a necessary evil as more and more people and industries rely on it, creating a dilemma between economy and environment.The aviation sector, if it were a country, would be one of the top 10 carbon polluting nations in the world. To put that in perspective, the top 10 countries together emit more than two-thirds of all carbon emitted each year. It is also one of the highest and fastest growing sources of individual emissions. A single international trip taken by one person emits more carbon than someone living in Paraguay for a year. Ground operations, mainly performed at the airport form a major aspect of the sector. Airports act as the interface between landside access to airspace and the airside access to the ground. Further, airports are not just transport hubs anymore, they are full-fledged industrial hubs, becoming bustling centres of businesses, hotels and other transport connectivity. It is no surprise that areas in and around airports are fast developing and expanding, now being referred to as 'airport metropolises'. This is fast becoming a problem as the amount of emissions from ground operations is researched to be as deadly, if not more as it tends to have an added and more direct impact on the local air quality. Creating sustainable airports, therefore, becomes essential to creating a more sustainable aviation sector. A big contribution in this direction comes from India. The Cochin International Airport became the first 'green airport' in the world, for which it was awarded the Champions of Earth award 2018, United Nations' highest environmental honour. The airport fully operates on solar power, which meets all its electricity requirements. This is no small feat as the Cochin airport stands to be one of the most important airports for not just India but the rest of the world. It is the largest airport in the state of Kerala and the seventh largest in India in terms of passenger traffic. It has one of the longest runways, measuring up to 3.4 km, equipped to handle the largest of aircrafts. It is also the first ever airport in India to be developed under Public-Private Partnership.Installing the first solar photovoltaic power station plant on the rooftop of the Arrival Terminal Block way back in 2013 turned out to be trendsetter. Since then, it has not looked back, adding several more solar power units to maximise energy production and produce enough for all its needs. A sum total of Rs 7 crore was spent on the solar power units, which might already have been recovered from the massive saving of Rs 7-8 lakh per month on electricity bills. In fact, most recent news on the Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL) confirmed that it has become power surplus, having achieved power neutrality way back in 2015. This means, CIAL now has a negative carbon footprint. Rather than adding to the global carbon emission, it is making a significant contribution in off-setting emissions done elsewhere. It is also now the second-largest energy producer in the Indian state of Kerala after the State Electricity Board (KSEB). CIAL has a culture of cost-effectiveness. The entire construction of Cochin airport can be considered a marvel given the low-cost of mere Rs 303 crore at which it was constructed. This sense of cost consciousness is probably what motivated the sustainability drive.Becoming energy positive might be the most important of its achievements but it by no means is the only. The airport is also engaged in scalable agro-photovoltaic activities, putting to efficient utilisation the vacant spaces between the solar panels within the CIAL solar plant, which has by far produced close to 90 metric tons of pesticide-free vegetables. This is largely in line with the Indian government's general push in the direction of organic and zero budget natural farming. The solar project pioneered by managing director Vattavayalil Joseph Kurian has motivated CIAL to take up several more solar and hydropower projects in the rest of the state.Since the success of the Cochin International Airport, the government of India has every airport in the country to produce at least 2 MW of solar energy. Despite having a large population leading to a low per capita GDP when compared to the global powers, India has engaged itself proactively in global environmental initiatives, being on track with its international commitments, and coming up with several great initiatives of its own, the International Solar Alliance being one of its major initiatives. In a world where the global climate action is witnessing a stagnation, India's environmental leadership is inducing hope for a better and sustainable future.",

        "articleBody": "Climate change may slow down India's solar and wind potential in the coming years, a new study by the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology shows. The seasonal and annual wind speed is likely to decrease over North India and increase along South India. The southern coast of Odisha and the southern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu show promising potential for wind energy in the climate change scenario, said the study titled 'Analysis of future wind and solar potential over India using climate models'.The researchers used state-of-the-art climate models devised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to analyse the wind and solar projections for the renewable energy sector over the Indian subcontinent.The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Current Science recently.The forecasts are important since India has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to fight climate change, incorporating two of the promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Glasgow conference -- reducing emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, from 2005 level, and achieving about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.  Solar projections for the future indicate that solar radiation will decrease during all seasons over most of the Indian landmass. For future investments in the solar power sector, central and south-central India must be considered during pre-monsoon months, as the potential loss is minimal in these regions,  it said. Regional analysis of wind potential indicates that the frequency of high energy producing wind speeds will decrease, whereas low energy producing wind speeds are likely to increase in the future. The present study shows that the renewable energy fields of solar and wind potential in India are likely to face a negative trend in the future... Expanded and more efficient networks of wind and solar farms are needed to increase renewable energy production,  the report read. Parthasarathi Mukhopadhyay, one of the researchers who conducted the study, said,  Our industry must adapt to the changing climate, and our technologies must keep pace. Such predictions should not be taken as facts, but as possibilities.  The efficiency of renewable energy may be impacted by climate change in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The study emphasises the importance of being prepared for scenarios of this kind and addressing it,  he said.",

Not hard to generate from wind/solar,  he added.Musk has been confident on building business on solar energy and runs the Tesla Solar vertical. This provides panels for rooftops, along with energy storage solutions. Tesla's solar business deployed a total of 106 megawatts in Q2 2022.  Although we continue to experience import delays beyond our control on certain solar components, we have expanded our supplier base to enable growth in this business,  said the company. Compared to the same quarter last year, Tesla upped solar deployments by 25 per cent.Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 and in April this year, a US judge has sided with Musk in a hefty lawsuit brought by Tesla shareholders, which accused the executive of coercing the electric vehicle company's board into buying SolarCity, originally launched in 2006 by Musk's cousins.Tesla solar panels are designed to be highly efficient, delivering maximum solar production year-round, even on roofs with complicated angles.Its home storage solution 'Powerwall' is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery stationary home energy storage product manufactured by Tesla Energy which stores electricity for solar self-consumption.(With inputs from agencies)",

Those were unthinkable in the recent past. But, thanks to the solar power project, the duration of working time has increased, and so is the business hours, boosting rural economy. 'Haats' (village markets) are now open even after dusk while roads from the village to the market are illuminated, helping villagers to cover the distance easily.  It is like a dream come true for us. Kerosine lamps and battery-operated flashlights were the only sources of light after dusk earlier. The village looked like a ghostly place at night. Now children can study at night; we can watch TV and recharge our mobile phones. Our life has changed,  Kalaha Reang, a farmer, said. An official said a 2 KW microgrid power plant each was installed at Sarkhipara and 11 other remote hamlets of Tripura for supplying electricity to villages in September last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi officially inaugurated the project in a virtual programme on July 30. Jetanjoy Reang who lives in neighbouring Nonachera village under Mungiyakami block said the solar plant has changed the lifestyle of the village, perched on the Atharamura hill range.  Now we can make handicrafts even at night and women weave Risa and Pachhra. We can also gather together in the evening under electric light and watch TV,  he said. 'Risa' is worn to cover the upper part of a woman's body while 'Pachhra' is draped around the lower part. Besides the dozen micro grid power plants that have been installed, 50 more such facilities will be established very soon, Joint Director of Tripura Energy Development Agency (TREDA), Debabrata Sukla Das, said. He said another 500 such remote villages were identified for installation of solar microgrid to serve people who are still living without electricity. The government is embarking on an ambitious project of illuminating markets and roads in remote tribal hamlets also through solar power. Sukla Das said the 'Grameen Bazar Alok Jyoti Scheme', partially funded by the central government, has already been implemented in certain areas and Sarkhipara is one of them. Due to lack of light at night, remote tribal markets operate once or twice a week and only during the day. As a result, rural markets have limited business hours for selling perishable items like vegetables and fruits.  They have no storage facility and market linkage. Sometimes, a comparatively prominent market is 15 to 20 kilometres away. So, the rural economy is suffering. After installation of solar street lights, marketing hours have been extended up to evening or night. Daily gathering and marketing activities increased manyfold and products are being sold easily,  he said. TREDA, a government organisation, has installed 2930 solar street lights in 239 markets in 12 blocks in the state.  We have a target of installing 15,000 solar street lights in 58 remote blocks and it is expected to be completed by December this year,  the TREDA official said. Deputy Chief Minister Jishnu Dev Varma said,  As the state is hilly, many remote hamlets either have unreliable power connectivity or no electricity at all. So, off-grid solar-based microgrids are the only feasible solution to provide electricity to them.  Dev Varma, who also holds the power department, said the state government will continue to electrify rural hamlets this way if it gets the backing of the Centre. However, a government official on condition of anonymity said maintenance of the solar plants is a challenge and continuous follow-up actions are required to keep those operational. A solar plant, which was installed in Khowai Government Hospital for supply of uninterrupted power, remained non-functional for the last five years due to lack of maintenance, he said.",

Mohan Reddy in presence of Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Union Minister for Coal, Mines Pralhad Joshi in Guwahati.Under the MoU, the 1000 MW solar power plant to be set up in Assam will be a joint venture project on 49:51 ratios between APDCL and NLCIL to support the increasing power requirement of the state. Sarma termed it a historic day for the state in the field of power generation. He said that since power requirement in Assam is increasing by leaps and bounds, the state should be in a position to produce more power to fulfil its own requirement and at the same time staying benign with the climate change.He said that once commissioned this solar power plant will serve the state in a big way by meeting its own requirement and helping Assam to contribute to Prime Minister Modi\u2019s agenda of combating climate change by producing more renewable energy.He also said that besides this 1000 MW solar power plant, the State government is ready to have another joint venture with NLCIL for yet another 1000 MW green power project. He also said that the State government has a definite plan to reduce the state's dependence on fossil fuel and step up generation of green energy in the near future. He said that Assam should work to formulate a long term vision to plan the state\u2019s growth and development.Sarma also thanked Union Minister for Coal, Mines Pralhad Joshi for his help and leadership in enabling NLCIL to go for the joint venture with the State government in power generation. He also thanked the Union Minister for his initiative in starting the operation of North Eastern Coalfields of Coal India Limited in Margherita.",

It is also an aesthetic roofing solution as it is integrated into a roofing cement panel. It can withstand above 200+ kilometre per hour and can withstand hail and snow. Yash Bhatia- Director of Uncle's Shop said on Monday that the company is happy to be a part of the local initiative to make the UAE sustainable and eco-friendly with new innovations and technologies in the solar industry.  ATUM generates 375W per unit and is a patented product. It is an extremely sleek 17 mm roof with a weight of 46 kg per unit and a guaranteed performance,  Bhatia said. It has been indigenously designed, developed and manufactured in India by its long-time business partner Visaka Industries Limited, a public listed company with its headquarters in Hyderabad. ATUM is certified by UL Labs in the USA. 'With its long-lasting lifespan, ATUM is the smartest solar roofing solution of the lot. It costs the same as laying a traditional roof and having solar panels installed on top of them. It is also a hassle-free job as ATUM generates optimum power while utilising maximum space of the solar cell,  said Bhatia. Bhatia said that the first ATUM project was initiated with Sharjah Investment Authority for the construction of a new mosque at Khrofakkan beach. The project is fully operational now.",

        "articleBody": "The more the sun shines in the southern German town of Aurach, the more likely it is that Jens Husemann's solar panels will be disconnected from the grid -- an exasperating paradox at a time when Germany is navigating an energy supply crisis.  It's being switched off every day,  Husemann told AFP during a recent sunny spell, saying there had been more than 120 days of forced shutdowns so far this year. Husemann, who runs an energy conversion business near Munich, also owns a sprawling solar power system on the flat roof of a transport company in Aurach, Bavaria. The energy generated flows into power lines run by grid operator N-Ergie, which then distributes it on the network. But in sunny weather, the power lines are becoming overloaded -- leading the grid operator to cut off supply from the solar panels.  It's a betrayal of the population,  said Husemann, pointing to soaring electricity prices and a continued push to install more solar panels across Germany. Europe's biggest economy is eyeing an ambitious switch to renewables making up 80 percent of its electricity from 2030 in a bid to go carbon neutral. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put a spanner in the works.  Moscow has cut gas supplies to Germany by 80 percent, in what is believed to be a bid to weaken the European powerhouse's resolve in backing Ukraine. As a result, Berlin has been scrambling for alternative sources across the world to replace the shortfall. This makes it all the more frustrating for Husemann, whose solar panels normally generate enough electricity for 50 households. With the repeated shutdowns, he suspects they will only supply half of their capacity by the end of the year.Grid bottlenecks  Grid operator N-Ergie, which is responsible for harvesting electricity from Husemann's panels, admits the situation is less than ideal.  There were 257 days last year when it had to cut off supply from solar panels on parts of the grid.  We are currently witnessing -- and this is a good thing -- an unprecedented boom in photovoltaic parks,  Rainer Kleedoerfer, head of N-Ergie's development department, told AFP. But while it takes just a couple of years to commission a solar power plant, updating the necessary infrastructure takes between five and 10 years, he said.  The number of interventions and the amount of curtailed energy have increased continuously in recent years  as a result, according to N-Ergie spokesman Michael Enderlein.   The likelihood is that grid bottlenecks will actually increase in the coming years,  while resolving them will take several more years, Enderlein said. According to Carsten Koenig, managing director of the German Solar Industry Association, the problem is not unique to solar power and also affects wind energy. Solar bottlenecks tend to be regional and temporary, he said.  Occasionally, however, we hear that especially in rural areas in Bavaria, the shutdowns are more frequent. 2.4 million households Koenig agrees the problem is likely to get worse before it gets better.  This will be especially true if political measures aimed at sufficiently expanding the power grid in Germany... drag on for too long,  he said. Some 6.1 terawatt hours of electricity from renewables had to be curtailed in 2020, according to the most recent figures available.  With an average consumption of around 2,500 kilowatt hours per year in a two-person household, this would have been enough to power around 2.4 million households.  A spokesman for Germany's Federal Network Agency said it did not share the belief that  it will not be possible to expand the network in line with demand in the coming years .  Only some aspects of the expansion are seeing delays, the spokesman said -- mainly due to slow approval procedures and a lack of specialist companies to do the work.  According to Husemann there have also been delays to the payments he is supposed to receive in return for the solar power he supplies -- or cannot supply. He said he is already owed around 35,000 euros ($35,600) for electricity produced so far this year that has never found its way into a socket.",

        "articleBody": "State-owned SJVN Ltd has bagged a 200 MW solar project worth Rs 1,200 crore in an e-reverse auction by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL). SJVN Chairman and Managing Director Nand Lal Sharma said in a statement that the company has secured a 200 MW solar power project through the e-reverse auction by MSEDCL. SJVN has bagged the full quoted capacity of the 200 MW solar project at the rate of Rs 2.90 per unit on a build-own - and operate basis in the tariff-based competitive bidding process of the MSEDCL. This ground-mounted solar project will be developed by SJVN anywhere in Maharashtra through EPC (engineering procurement construction) contract. Sharma also said that the tentative cost for the development of this project is Rs 1,200 crore. The project will be commissioned within 18 Months from the date of signing of the power purchase agreement, which will be signed between SJVN and MSEDCL shortly. In a BSE filing, the company informed that the project is expected to generate 455.52 MUs (million units) in the 1st year and the cumulative energy generation for 25 years would be about 10,480.82 MU. As per RfS (request for selection), the project will be commissioned in 18 months from the date of signing of PPA (power purchase agreement) i.e. by FY 2023-24. The PPA will be signed between MSEDCL and SJVN for 25 years, the filing stated. The commissioning of this project is expected to reduce 5,13,560 tonnes of carbon emission, the company has said in the filing.

        "articleBody": "With an aim to increase the power generation capacity of the central state of Madhya Pradesh and address the electricity problems in the region, a floating solar power plant is going to be built in Khandwa which will generate 600 Megawatt power by 2022-23, informed the officials on Wednesday. Said to be the world's largest floating solar plant, the project is estimated to be worth over Rs. 3000 crores.  Omkareshwar Dam is built on the Narmada river. This is our hydel project and in this, we produce energy from water, but it is spread over about 100 square kilometres, there is a very large water body where the water level remains normal,  Renewable Energy Department Principal Secretary Sanjay Dubey said. Dubey also said that the change in water level in the area was nominal and it thus serves as a suitable site.  We will have a PPA of 300 MW. So we have given a little bit of leverage, maybe a little more or less as per the requirement, so in total instead of 300, we are doing PPA in the first phase of 278 MW,  he added. Dubey also highlighted that with the new floating solar plant, Khandwa will become the only district in Madhya Pradesh to have thermal power stations, hydel and solar power.  In the next phase, we have called tenders for 300 MW more, so this will be the world's largest project which will be called floating solar,  said Dubey. Khandwa will become the only district in the state to have all three things including solar, hydel and thermal with over 4,000MW power to be produced from a single district,  he added.",

        "articleBody": "Going to the bank in his home village in western India used to be a slow, frustrating process for Kiran Patil, as frequent power cuts - sometimes lasting for days - turned what should have been a quick errand into a lengthy ordeal. The 59-year-old farmer often had to wait for hours in line at RBL Bank, his local branch in the village of Aitawade Budruk, or abandon his transaction and return the next day, wasting time he should have been spending cultivating his crops. All that changed after the building was fitted with a set of solar panels and backup storage batteries in 2018, breaking the bank's reliance on the power grid and giving it a steady supply of clean electricity.  The transactions now are so smooth and fast,  Patil told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  These days we even find time for a quick chat with the branch manager over a cup of tea, to learn of the latest services and facilities.  A more reliable banking experience is also bringing in new customers who previously didn't have the time for long waits or who worried about never knowing when they would be able to access their money. Since the solar power system was installed at RBL in Aitawade Budruk, the bank has been opening 25 to 30 new accounts every month - 10 times more than before, said branch manager Sandeep Banne. As India boosts its use of renewable energy in an effort to wean itself off climate-heating coal, the country is leaning heavily on solar energy to cut carbon emissions and help stabilise a grid squeezed by coal shortages and surging demand from a population trying to keep cool during hotter summers. But some communities have discovered another benefit to the solar power push: greater financial system access for millions of the country's unbanked, including the estimated 20% of Indian adults who have no access to a bank account or formal line of credit. Raghuraman Chandrasekaran, founder and CEO of E-Hands Energy, the Chennai-based firm that set up the solar unit in Aitawade Budruk, said his company has installed such systems at more than 920 rural banks across India, helping bring more than 6 million people into the formal banking system. The company plans to install units at up to 100 more rural branches before the end of the year, he said.  Citizens in rural areas were walking or spending their precious money to transport themselves from their villages to the nearest bank branch, then waiting (there) for hours ... simply because the bank did not have electricity all day and the computers could not work,  said Chandrasekaran.  It was all misery.  MODERN BANKING The three-kilowatt solar power system at the Aitawade Budruk branch - which runs everything from the fans and lights to computers and alarm systems - means the bank now has reliable power about 95% of the time, said Banne, the branch manager. On cloudy days, backup storage batteries take over, he said. Firms like E-Hands Energy, Tata Power Solar and Husk Power Systems have so far outfitted more than 2,000 banks in rural India with solar power, estimates Shyam Kumar Garg, who retired as deputy general manager at the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development last October. The systems feed into India's efforts to install 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030, up from about 115 GW now, more than half of which is solar. E-Hands Energy's manager of operations Kakumanu Prathap Sagar said the solar systems the company has installed at banks around India is helping cut about 3,000 tons of carbon emissions every year. Going solar can cut costs too, said Banne at RBL in Aitawade Budruk, noting that the branch now spends a fraction of what it used to for grid electricity and diesel for its backup generators. The solar systems cost between Rs 1,30,000 and Rs 1,50,000 for installation and maintenance for four years, and pay for themselves in about four years, he added. For villagers, the biggest benefit is finally being able to use government services they never had access to before, said Pratibha Budruk, head of the Aitawade Budruk's village council. When the bank suffered power cuts and frequent loss of internet connectivity, payments of pensions, students' scholarships, loans and insurance were often delayed, putting a strain on people who relied on the money, Budruk said.  The changeover of rural banks to solar power ... has opened the doors of modern banking facilities for our local villagers,  she said. SOLAR POWER CHALLENGES In a country where 65% of the population lives in rural areas, according to the World Bank, switching rural banks to solar power might even slow the migration of young people from villages to cities as more economic opportunities at home arise, said energy management expert Binoy Krishna Choudhury.  Solarising banks is a good step to developing the rural economy,  said Choudhury, who teaches at the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management in Kolkata. But projects to bring solar panels to rural banks face a raft of obstacles, said Russell deLucia, director and founder of the Small-Scale Sustainable Infrastructure Development Fund, a U.S.-based nonprofit. Potential hurdles include finding ways to transport and install the equipment in far flung, often off-road locations, said deLucia, whose company helps E-Hands raise funding for its solar power projects. Once the systems are up and running, finding skilled technicians nearby to fix anything that goes wrong is another issue, he said. Despite those challenges, Budruk, the village council head, wants to see more banks tap into solar power as a way to both improve the lives of rural communities and limit worsening climate change impacts such as extreme heat.  Installing solar systems in the banks is like planting trees throughout the year for purifying the air we breathe,  she said.  When the whole world is trying hard to slow global warming and the impacts of climate change, this is a small contribution from our village. ",

He will participate in the grand finale marking the culmination of 'Ujjwal Bharat Ujjwal Bhavishya -- Power @2047' at 12:30 PM via video conferencing, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office said. 'Ujjwal Bharat Ujjwal Bhavishya -- Power @2047' is taking place from July 25 to 30 as part of ongoing 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav'. Organised across the country, it showcases the transformation in the power sector achieved in the last eight years. During the programme, the prime minister will launch the revamped distribution sector scheme. He will also dedicate and lay the foundation stone of various green energy projects of NTPC, according to the statement. Modi will also launch the national solar rooftop portal.  Under the leadership of the prime minister, the government has taken multiple path breaking initiatives in the power sector, the statement said.  These reforms have transformed the sector, with the focus being on making affordable power available for all. Electrification of about 18,000 villages which did not have access to power earlier signified the commitment of the government towards ensuring last mile outreach, it said.  In a historic initiative, the prime minister will launch the Ministry of Power's flagship revamped distribution sector scheme, which is aimed at improving the operational efficiencies and financial sustainability of the DISCOMs and power departments, the statement said.  With an outlay of over Rs 3 lakh crore over a period of five years from FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26, the scheme aims to provide financial assistance to DISCOMs for modernisation and strengthening of distribution infrastructure, focussing on improvement of the reliability and quality of supply to end consumers.  It also aims to reduce the AT and C (Aggregate Technical and Commercial) losses to pan-India levels of 12-15 per cent and ACS-ARR (Average Cost of Supply -- Average Revenue Realised) gap to zero by 2024-25 by improving the operational efficiencies and financial sustainability of all state-sector DISCOMs and power departments.  During the programme, Modi will also dedicate and lay the foundation stone of various green energy projects of NTPC worth over Rs 5,200 crore.  He will inaugurate the 100 MW Ramagundam Floating Solar Project in Telangana and the 92 MW Kayamkulam Floating Solar Project in Kerala. He will lay the foundation stone of 735 MW Nokh Solar Project in Rajasthan, Green Hydrogen Mobility Project in Leh and Kawas Green Hydrogen Blending with Natural Gas project in Gujarat, according to the statement.  The Ramagundam project is India's largest floating solar PV project with 4.5 lakh 'Made in India' solar PV modules. Kayamkulam project is the second largest floating solar PV project consisting of 3 lakh 'Made in India' solar PV panels floating on water. The 735 MW Solar PV Project at Nokh, in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan is India's largest domestic content requirement-based solar project with 1000 MWp at a single location, deploying high-wattage bifacial PV Modules with tracker system.  The green hydrogen mobility Project at Leh, Ladakh is a pilot project and aims for five fuel cell buses to be run in and around Leh, the statement said.  This pilot project would be the first deployment of fuel cell electric vehicles for public use in India. The green hydrogen blending pilot project at NTPC Kawas Township will be India's first green hydrogen blending project helping in reducing the usage of natural gas, it said.  Modi will also launch national solar rooftop portal, which will enable online tracking of the process of installation of rooftop solar plants, starting from registering the applications to release of subsidy in residential consumers' bank accounts after installation and inspection of the plant.  It aims to empower citizens by improving their awareness and participation in various power related initiatives, schemes and programmes of government, the statement added.",

        "articleBody": "India must become a manufacturing hub for photovoltaic modules and not just be traders of solar components under the Aatmanirbhar initiative, Union Minister Bhagwanth Khuba said on Thursday. Khuba, the Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy, was speaking at the Mercom India Solar Summit 2022.   So far India was dependent on other countries (for PV modules and solar components) but under Aatmanirbhar Bharat, we should not become only traders, we have to be manufacturers. India must be a hub of it,  he said while addressing over 300 participants in a session on renewable energy.  The minister said the government launched the PLI scheme to manufacture of PV modules and related components in India to support the domestic solar sector.  In April 2021, the Union Cabinet approved a Rs 4,500 crore Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic manufacturing capacity of solar PV modules.  The funding under the scheme for domestic solar cells and module manufacturing was enhanced to Rs 24,000 crore by the government to make the country an exporting nation.  On the duties levied on solar modules, the minister said,  it was not to discourage our Indian investors. It is to encourage Indian manufacturers so India should become a solar manufacturers hub in future.   In 2021, the government had announced imposing 40 per cent BCD (basic custom duty) on solar modules and 25 per cent on solar cells with effect from April 1, 2022.  Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group said a report will be shared with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) on the outcome of the sessions of the two-day summit.   We will share details on the challenges the industry is facing and stakeholders' expectations from the government to address their concerns,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "India has commissioned 57.71 GW of solar capacity while another 48.71 GW was in the pipeline at June end against the target of achieving 100 GW capacity by December 2022, Parliament was informed on Tuesday. Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy Bhagwanth Khuba in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha stated that a solar energy capacity of 123.11 GW has either been commissioned or is in the pipeline.  The government has set a target of achieving 100 GW solar power capacity by December 2022 in the country, Khuba said.  Solar projects commissioned (including off-grid) are 57.71 GW while 48.71 GW solar capacity is under implementation. Solar projects with a total capacity of 16.69 GW are under tendering as of June 30, 2022.  Challenges faced in the implementation of solar projects include deceleration of pace of implementation to a considerable extent due to COVID pandemic; acquisition of clear land and mismatch in timelines between solar projects and power evacuation infrastructure, the minister said.  In another reply to the House, the minister said,  A total of 114.07 GW of renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) have been installed in the country as of June 30, 2022.  Renewable energy projects of 60.66 GW capacity (excluding large hydro) are under various stages of implementation and 23.14 GW capacity are under various stages of bidding.  The installed wind energy capacity is 40.78GW as of June 30.  In another reply, the minister stated that so far, a total of 160.92 GW of renewable energy capacity (including large hydro) has been installed in the country as of June 30, 2022.  This capacity includes 57.71 GW solar power, 40.79 GW wind power, 10.68 GW bio-power, 4.89 GW small hydro power and 46.85 GW Large Hydro Power. Further, projects of 74.76 GW capacity are under various stages of implementation and 23.14 GW capacity are under various stages of bidding.  In another reply, the minister told the House that the discoms have purchased 3,75,81,714 renewable energy certificates (RECs) (till June 30, 2022) , which is 53.92 per cent of 6,96,93,635 RECs sold so far since inception of this concept of renewable purchase obligation in 2010.  The REC mechanism was launched in 2010 to facilitate obligated entities to meet their Renewable Purchase Obligations and also to incentivise Renewable Energy generators.  One REC is equivalent to 1000 MWhr. These RECs are given to a RE generator who does not sell electricity from renewable energy sources to an obligated entity for generation of 1MWhr of electricity.  The Open Access/Captive Power Producers purchased 3,18,18,478 RECs till June this year, which is 45.65 per cent of the total 6,96,93,635 REC sold so far.",

Total corporate funding (including venture capital funding, public market, and debt financing) in 1H 2022 stood at USD 12 billion, 11 per cent lower compared to the USD 13.5 billion raised in 1H 2021,  the global clean energy consulting firm said in its latest report.In January-June 2022, venture capital (VC) funding activity increased 125 per cent to USD 3.7 billion across 53 deals compared to the USD 1.6 billion in 26 deals in the year-ago period.In India, rooftop solar startup SolarSquare raised USD 4 million in a seed funding round led by Good Capital with participation from US-based Lowercarbon Capital, Singapore-based Symphony Asia, and Zerodha founder Nithin Kamath's Rainmatter under the VC category. SustVest raised USD 160,000 from angel investors.Solar public market financing during the period under review fell 10 per cent to USD 3.3 billion in eight deals, from USD 3.7 billion in 13 deals in 1H 2021.Under the public market finance segment, Abu Dhabi-based strategic investment firm International Holding Company announced the completion of a  USD 2 billion investment transaction in the Adani Portfolio companies: Adani Green Energy, Adani Transmission and Adani Enterprises - through the preferential allotment route. Adani Green will receive USD 500 million out of this investment .The debt financing activity in 1H 2022 dropped 39 per cent to USD 5 billion in 30 deals, from USD 8.2 billion raised through 32 deals a year ago.In debt financing, Azure Power agreed to invest USD 12.9 million in Premier Group, a solar cell and module manufacturer. The current state of the economy -- inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain issues -- has started to impact fundraising in the solar sector. Even though the first half numbers held up, there was a pronounced slowdown from Q1 to Q2 (April-June). Besides venture and private equity funding, all other areas experienced a decline in financing activity. But, the value of solar is more evident than ever to markets that are dependent on energy imports. Clean energy installation goals are being ramped up around the world, and solar is a long-term beneficiary of this trend,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.",

The assets will be valued at \u20b94,500-5,000 crore ($700 million), added sources.Vector Green Energy is wholly owned by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners India, the Indian af\ufb01liate of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) - a leading global independent infrastructure fund manager. Standard Chartered Bank is advising GIP to sell-off the assets.Vector Green portfolio includes 19 ground-mounted utility scale projects located across 8 states as well as 89 rooftop solar projects on 216 roofs across 7 states in India. An additional 90 MW of solar projects are under implementation in Gujarat. Vector Green had expanded its portfolio in 2019 by acquiring about 225 MW solar generation capacity from RattanIndia.ET first reported about the potential transaction in October 2021.Spokespersons with GIP, JSW Energy, Apraava Energy declined to comment while mails sent to Sembcorp, Torrent Power did not elicit any responses till the press time.GIP is one of the world's largest infrastructure focused investors that manages over $71 billion (Rs 5.3 lakh crore) of assets including over 15GW of renewable projects. GIP entered India in 2018 by acquiring infrastructure asset management business from IDFC Alternatives Ltd. The most significant attribute of the Vector Green portfolio is that 97% of the capacity is contracted with the best off-takers of the country viz. SECI and NTPC, through 25-year fixed- tariff power purchase agreements, said in a 2021 Crisil report. Most of the major power producers in India are in a mode of reducing carbon emissions with expanding their clean energy portfolio.JSW had announced large plans to reduce the carbon footprints, with achieving a renewable energy capacity of 10 GW by FY25 and 20 GW by 2030. JSW Energy has allotted a capex of Rs75,000 crore for expanding the renewable energy capacity. At present, the share of clean energy in the installed capacity of 4.6 GW is 30% and it is expected to reach 70% by FY25 and 85% by FY30. At present, 2.5 GW renewable energy production is under construction.JSW Energy is also acquiring 1.8 GW renewable energy assets of Mytrah Energy for $1.8-2 billion.Sembcorp had announced last year about expanding its renewable energy capacity to 10GW by 2025 from 2.6GW in 2020, and a 25 percent reduction by 2025 in its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2020. Sembcorp's renewable energy capacity stands at 5.7GW with wind and solar offerings in key markets such as India, Singapore, Vietnam and China.Torrent Power currently has an aggregate installed generation capacity of 4.7 GW, with a renewable portfolio of 1.6 GW.Apraava Energy, jointly owned by Hong Kong based CLP and Canadian fund CDPQ. has a diverse portfolio comprising 3.1 GW of installed capacity which includes 924 MW of wind and 250 MW of solar energy projects across seven states, as well as a power transmission asset.",

        "articleBody": "Countries need to expand manufacturing of solar panels from their current concentrated base in China to ensure secure supply and meet targets for cutting planet-warming carbon emissions, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday.The world needs to double its current capacity to produce the  key building blocks  of solar panels: polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules, by 2030, the IEA said in a new report.Partly thanks to Chinese investment, solar photovoltaic technology, which converts sunlight into electricity, has become the cheapest way to generate power in many parts of the world.In 2021, China was home to 79% of manufacturing capacity for polysilicon, the IEA said. A full 42% of that is located in the province of Xinjiang, where the country's largest plant accounts on its own for 14% of global capacity. This level of concentration in any global supply chain would represent a considerable vulnerability,  IEA executive director Fatih Birol told Reuters.China will soon produce almost 95% of the world's polysilicon and the ingots and wafers further down the value chain, the report said. If there is a fire or a natural disaster it may have implications for the global clean energy transition in terms of pushing the prices up and even availability of solar PV, but if you diversify and take necessary measures, we suggest to governments around the world that this risk will be addressed, maybe even diminished,  Birol said.Under pressure to cut reliance on Russian gas imports, the European Union has pledged to do  whatever it takes  to rebuild European capacity to manufacture parts for solar installations.European countries have the potential to manufacture these parts in ways that emit less carbon, thanks to the high shares of nuclear and renewables in their power mixes, the report said.However, it said only Sweden currently has low enough industrial power prices to manufacture products like wafers competitively.",

        "articleBody": "Jharkhand aims to achieve a capacity of 4000 MW of solar power in the next five years and is open to attracting investors in the space with lucrative offers, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said on Tuesday. Soren launched the Solar Energy Policy 2022 on Tuesday and laid the foundation stone in the virtual mode for 600 KW capacity solar plant at Dhanbad and Dumka airports and a grid connected rooftop power plant for domestic consumers under the Giridih Solar City Scheme. Under the new policy, generation of 4000 MW of solar energy is scheduled from 2022-2023 to 2026-27, he said. The policy also seeks to create jobs, growth opportunities and sustainability in Jharkhand, which currently generates less than 45 MW of solar energy, he said. Jharkhand has potential for solar energy as it has around 300 days of clear sun with high solar insolation. The policy entails a dedicated solar power cell, statutory approval within a maximum of 60 days, setting up of 1000 solar villages, schemes to encourage economically backward villagers to adopt solar energy and cross subsidy for it, the chief minister said. Soren also launched a web portal for Kisan Solar Water Pump Set scheme which will simplify the process of distribution and installation of solar pumps for farmers. The portal will also provide aid in the pump scheme for the next five years. Under the new policy the government will give subsidy of up to 80 per cent of the total installation cost will be given to people living in cities having an annual income of less than Rs 3 lakh for rooftop solar panels, he said. Jharkhand had notified its first Solar Power Policy in August 2015 with a target to generate 2,650 MW of solar energy by 2020. It also launched 'Jharkhand Solar Rooftop Policy, 2018' to promote rooftop solar installations. However, both initiatives had failed to attract private investors due to reasons like land and incentive issues. In order to sort out the issues, Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA) has partnered with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a leading not-for-profit policy research institute, for drafting the new policy. According to the policy, there are three broad project categories - utility scale solar, distributed solar and off-grid solar - with different target generations and envisions solar plants to be installed on government and private lands and water bodies including dams and canals. Jharkhand has 31 reservoirs with a cumulative surface area of 354 sq km, indicating a conservative potential of 1160 MW. Altogether 1000 model solar villages would be set up to ensure complete solarisation of various consumptive and productive loads, he said. To promote rooftop solar projects in cities, the policy proposes 60 per cent subsidy, which also includes a central subsidy, for installation of up to 3 kw power plant and an 80 per cent subsidy for installation of 3 kw to 10 kw plants. The policy also proposed a dedicated Solar Policy Cell to be created under JREDA. All statutory clearances and approvals will be provided to the solar power project developers through this single window facility in a time-bound manner within 60 days. As regards, solar pumps 96 per cent subsidy is being provided to the farmers for off-grid pump sets. So far in the first phase 6717 solar pump sets have been installed in the entire state, out of which 6500 solar pump sets have been installed across the state from 2020 to 2022, as per the state government. Jharkhand ranks fifth in the country in installing solar pump sets, as per the government that has set an ambitious target of installing 10,000 solar pump sets in the second phase.",

        "articleBody": "The Jharkhand government is all set to unveil an ambitious new solar policy aiming at increasing clean energy capacity up to 4,000 megawatts in the next five years and attracting investors, an official said.To encourage families to use rooftop solar panels in cities, a subsidy of up to 80 per cent of the total installation cost will be given to people having an annual income of less than Rs 3 lakh.The Jharkhand Solar Policy, 2022, which also seeks to create jobs, growth opportunities and sustainability, will be unveiled by Chief Minister Hemant Soren on July 5, the official said.Currently, the state generates less than 45 MW of solar energy.\u201cThe new policy is progressive and investor-friendly. Land rules have been simplified and several other projects such as solar floating projects and canal top solar projects have been introduced to the new policy,\u201d Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA) project director Bijay Kumar Sinha told PTI.Earlier in August 2015, the state had notified its first Solar Power Policy with a target to generate 2,650 megawatts of solar energy by 2020. It also launched \u2018Jharkhand Solar Rooftop Policy, 2018' to promote rooftop solar installations.However, the initiatives failed to attract private investors due to several reasons including land and incentive issues.In order to sort out those issues, Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA) has partnered with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a leading not-for-profit policy research institute, for drafting the new policy.The policy sets a cumulative target of generating 4,000 MW of solar energy in the next five years.According to the policy, there are three broad project categories - utility-scale solar, distributed solar and off-grid solar \u2013 with different target generations.The policy envisions solar plants to be installed on government, private lands and water bodies including dams and canals.Jharkhand has 31 reservoirs with a cumulative surface area of 354 sq km, indicating a conservative potential of 1160 MW. The policy also aims to deploy 400 MW of solar installations on canal tops.\u201cWe have also proposed to create a land bank under the policy so that private parties could get land easily for solar power projects,\u201d Sinha said.Altogether 1000 model solar villages would be set up to ensure complete solarisation of various consumptive and productive loads, he said.Jharkhand has potential for solar energy due to its topography. The state has around 300 days of clear sun with high solar insolation.In a bid to promote rooftop solar projects in cities, the policy proposes a 60 per cent subsidy, which also includes a central subsidy, for installation of up to 3kW power plant and an 80 per cent subsidy for installation of 3kW to 10kW plants.However, the subsidy will be applicable only to those beneficiaries whose annual income is less than Rs 3 lakh.\u201cThere is already a central subsidy scheme for such rooftop solar plants for the people having annual income above Rs 3 lakh,\u201d JREDA Executive Engineer Mukesh Kumar told PTI.There is a provision for up to 60 per cent subsidy under solar for livelihood projects. It includes promoting solar-powered appliances such as solar dryers for farm produce, solar-powered cold storage, solar desalination, solar charkha and others.The policy also proposes for a dedicated Solar Policy Cell to be created under the JREDA.All statutory clearances and approvals will be provided to the solar power project developers through this single window facility in a time-bound manner within 60 days.",

In each of these districts, Adani Group has proposed that they will be generating 3,000 jobs in Kurukutti, 3000 in Karrivalasa, 1500 in Chitravathi and 2500 in Gandikota.The project is stipulated to commence in December 2022 and is likely to commission in December 2028. While the plants will be set up spanning across 1,490 acres of land, the state government has decided that the land will be leased from farmers at the cost of Rs 30,000 per acre in these districts, which will be transferred to the farmers directly.Meanwhile, the state will be generating a revenue of Rs 2,775 crore from the project in terms of the power stored and an additional Rs 980 crore from the SGST. This will give a big boost to the state in terms of investment and a positive message as the employment rate continues to rise in the state,  Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said in the meeting.In other decisions taken in the SIPB meeting, the government has decided to apply for the PM MITRA scheme, which proposes to set up an integrated textile park in YSR Jagananna Mega Industrial Hub at Kopparthy in YSR District. The government, as per the conditions laid down under the scheme, has proposed that they would be fixing the power cost at Rs 4.5 per unit and Rs 60 per TMC of water for the 10-year period of the project.The SIPB has also cleared the setting up of a shrimp processing unit at the food park in Krishna district by Avisa Foods Private Limited. The project would generate 2,500 jobs in 12 months and the company has requested for 11.64 acres of land from the state government of Andhra Pradesh. The SIPB has decided to lease the 11.64 acres at the cost of Rs 1,027 per sqm. The government has also laid out condition that the effluent treatment plant (ETP) would be set up by the company.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's top oil firm Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) on Wednesday unveiled a stationary, rechargeable and indoor cooking stove that uses the sun's energy to cook food while always being kept in the kitchen. The stove, which entails a one-time procurement cost and has zero maintenance, is being touted as a substitute for fossil fuels.  Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri hosted a function at his official residence where a full three-course meal cooked on the stove, which has been named Surya Nutan, was served.  Speaking on the occasion, IOC Director (R&D) SSV Ramakumar said the stove is different from solar cookers as it does not have to be placed under sunlight.  Surya Nutan, which has been developed by IOC's research and development division at Faridabad, always stays in the kitchen and a cable carries solar energy captured through a PV panel kept outdoor or on the roof.  It collects energy from the sun, converts it into heat through a specially designed heating element, stores thermal energy in a scientifically proven thermal battery and reconverts the energy for use in indoor cooking. The energy captured not just covers day time cooking needs of a family of four but also the night meal.   One kg of LPG saved (using the stove) will mitigate 3 carbon dioxide emissions,  he said adding that the prototype is being currently tested at 60 locations including Ladakh where solar intensity is very high.  Once tests are completed, commercial manufacturing would be launched.   The stove currently costs between Rs 18,000 to Rs 30,000 but considering economies of scale when 2-3 lakh units are produced and some government support, the cost can come down to Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 a unit,  he said.  The stove has a 10-year life with no maintenance. It does not have a traditional battery that needs replacement. Also, the solar panel has a 25-year life.  It can be used for the full range of cooking - boiling, steaming, frying and cooking roti, he said adding that an electrical grid can be used as an auxiliary supply when the charge is low or on cloudy days.  Puri, who tried his hand at cooking a dessert on the stove, said it would take 2-3 months for the commercial launch and the cost can come down further if it generates enough demand.  IOC Chairman SM Vaidya said the company may manufacture the stoves on its own or could go for contract manufacturing.",

        "articleBody": "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP) is in advanced talks to acquire a stake of about 49% in Mahindra Susten, the renewable energy unit of Mahindra and Mahindra, said people aware of the development. OTPP, one of the largest pension funds in Canada, is likely to pay \u20b92,300 crore for the stake, valuing the company at \u20b94,600 crore, inclusive of debt, they said, adding that both sides have signed a deal exclusivity clause.This is the third attempt in the last two years by the Mahindra Group to offload a stake in Mahindra Susten. Investment bank Avendus Capital is advising Mahindra Susten after a sale process in FY20 run by Rothschild failed despite negotiations with Brookfield for a 100% acquisition.Mahindra Susten was established to build solar parks under the National Solar Mission. Originally a part of its in-house incubation wing, Mahindra Partners, it was spun off as a separate entity as it diversified into engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), operations and maintenance, rooftop solar panels, data management and software services for third-party developers such as ReNew Power, Azure, SB Energy and others.OTPP declined to comment. A Mahindra spokesperson told ET the company will  not be able to participate  in the story.Mahindra Susten's revenue fell 55% to \u20b9952 crore in FY21 from the year earlier as net profit slumped to \u20b96 crore from \u20b942 crore. Covid-led disruptions resulted in the loss of several construction days in the first half of FY21, deferment and cancellation of a few overseas projects, and slow mobilisation of existing under-construction projects, said an India Ratings report. Debt rose to \u20b9719 crore at the end of March 2021 from \u20b9466 crore in the year before. As an independent power producer, Mahindra Susten has a total portfolio of solar projects with a capacity of 1.2 GW across the country. Its main operational assets include a 337.50 MW park at Rewa, a 175 MW project in Bikaner, an 84.50 MW plant at Charanka, Gujarat, and a 59.8 MW plant in Telangana. Being one of the top two independent solar EPC companies in the country, its portfolio includes projects, executed and under construction, with a peak capacity of 4.2 GW. A deal will mark the debut of OTPP in the Indian renewable energy space. The Canadian fund has a strong presence in the Indian roads sector and has thus far stayed away from the booming clean tech arena, which has seen peers CPPIB, CDPQ dominate. OTPP was one of the contenders to acquire Actis' renewable energy platform in India, Sprng Energy, which was bought by Shell. OTPP, which has net assets worth $36 billion in infrastructure globally, plans to invest another $16 billion in the next five years. ",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Servotech Power Systems on Monday announced that it has developed a solar performance monitoring and controlling device called ComPort. The device will identify defects, issue notifications, diagnose issues and suggest O&M (operation and maintenance) tasks. Servotech Power Systems has developed a first-of-its-kind solar performance monitoring and controlling device in association with the German development agency Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ), the company said in a statement. According to the statement, this device -- dubbed as ComPort -- has been successfully tested with the portable solar system PV port at the EUREF-Campus in Berlin, Germany. A revolutionary breakthrough in its class, ComPort can be integrated into any domestic off-grid/hybrid solar system and turn it into a smart solar system. Additionally, the PV port -- a portable solar system -- has been also erected at the same campus. Specifically built to make users more aware of how well their solar systems are working, this mobile app-controlled device can make available several system insights to their fingertips, as per the statement. The IoT-enabled ComPort's intelligent app helps to identify defects, issue notifications, diagnose issues, and suggest O&M tasks. Additionally, any anomalies or underperformance are recognised proactively with constant monitoring. Also, it stated that ComPort considerably helps to lower the chances of a system malfunctioning. The device can monitor, control and report I/O Power (input-output), battery charge/discharge and solar power generation. The app also keeps track of previous results to enable comparison. The device is developed on DIY-concept and can be easily installed into any domestic solar system. It also offers data interfaces for third-party O&M companies to combine and analyse data. The development of the PV port and ComPort is a project under a bilateral Indo-German programme implemented by GIZ. It will contribute to the wider implementation of solar in India and Germany, especially for the urban PV, the company said. German Green politician Bettina Jarasch, Deputy Mayor of Berlin and Senator for Environment, Mobility, Consumer and Climate Protection, has said,  At least 10 PV ports should be installed at Friedrich Strasse (Frederick Street) to reduce public car traffic and enable a public free solar-powered charging station . Present at the testing, Servotech's founder and Managing Director Raman Bhatia said,  We are proud to develop ComPort, which is a first-of-its-kind universally applicable instrument that can be integrated with any off-grid and hybrid inverter and empower users who have applied solar solutions to get the most out of these systems. Features such as DIY-friendly installation, remote power scheduling and minimised energy costs, make this device the perfect solution leading to optimised solar system performance. Further, we have also filed multiple patents for the device .  The Pilot PV Port now installed and commissioned at EUREF-Campus will allow further study in the installation of urban PVs across different user segments, contributing to the global endeavour against climate change and dependency on fossil fuels,  GIZ's Principal Advisor, Joerg Gaebler said.

        "articleBody": "US renewable energy developers have delayed or scrapped several big battery projects meant to store electrical power on the grid in recent months, scuttling plans to replace fossil fuels with wind and solar energy. At least a dozen storage projects meant to support growing renewable energy supplies have been postponed, canceled or renegotiated as labor and transport bottlenecks, soaring minerals prices, and competition from the electric vehicle industry crimp supply. One previously unreported dispute over a delayed California storage project has even wound up in court. The slowdown in utility-scale battery installations threatens the pace of the U.S. transition away from fossil fuels as the Biden administration seeks to decarbonize the grid by 2035. The delays could pose a threat to power reliability in states that already depend heavily on renewable energy like California. Storing power is considered vital to the expansion of solar and wind energy because it allows electricity generated when the sun is shining or wind is blowing to be used at the end of the day when consumers need it most. The delays span states including California, Hawaii and Georgia, with battery providers including Tesla and Fluence warning of disruptions to supply, according to a review of regulatory documents, corporate statements and interviews with project developers and power providers. The delays, some of which have not been previously reported, range from several months to a year, according to the Reuters reporting.  I have not seen a nascent industry challenged on so many fronts,  said Jamal Burki, president of IHI Terrasun Solutions, the U.S. energy storage arm of Japanese heavy equipment maker IHI Corp. European energy storage projects are also facing delays, but that region lags the United States in the development of grid-scale storage, making the issue less pronounced. Ben Guest, fund manager at Gresham House Energy Storage Fund , which invests in battery projects in Britain, said he has seen two- to three-month delays in projects primarily due to component shortages and shipping challenges. Energy storage makes up about 3% of U.S. operating clean energy capacity and has been growing rapidly. Installations soared 170% in the first quarter to 758 megawatts, according to the American Clean Power Association, roughly enough capacity to power 144,000 homes. But the pace is dipping below forecasts. Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie told Reuters it may revise down its current outlook for U.S. storage installations of 5.9 GW this year because of the rising evidence of market disruptions, after 2021 installations came in at about two-thirds of what it initially expected. Prices for lithium-ion batteries, three-quarters of which are produced in China, have soared as much as 20% since last year as lithium and nickel costs rise, COVID-19 lockdowns disrupt manufacturing, and transport constraints slow shipments. Robust demand from EV producers for batteries has also been a headwind, industry players told Reuters. Battery manufacturers are favoring the EV market because their orders are more predictable compared to the lumpy, project-based orders from power storage developers.  When the pullback happens, it's felt worse by the storage industry than it is by the electric vehicle industry,  said Andy Tang, vice president of energy storage and optimization at storage developer Wartsila.  We're a difficult customer.  Recent turmoil in the solar industry, caused by uncertainty over potential tariffs on Asian imports, has also impacted storage development. Constructing storage alongside solar allows facilities to claim a federal tax credit that does not exist for standalone batteries. The Biden administration this week announced it would waive tariffs for two years on panels from countries impacted by a Commerce Department investigation, an attempt to revitalize solar installations. SUMMER CRUNCHThese obstacles have raised questions about the fate of some 14.7 gigawatts of U.S. battery storage in development, some of which state authorities had hoped would be in place to prevent blackouts as early as this summer. Among recent delays is 535-MW of storage Ameresco Inc is developing for Southern California Edison, one of the state's biggest utilities. It expects just a portion of the project -- about 300 MW -- to be online by its August target. Ameresco did not respond to a request for comment. Central Coast Community Energy (CCCE), which purchases power on behalf of 430,000 customers in five California counties, is also facing delays of six clean energy projects, including 122 MW of storage, needed to meet state-mandated clean energy requirements, according to spokesperson Catherine Stedman. The developers of the projects, originally meant to come online this year and next, have warned of delays between six and 12 months, Stedman said. CCCE and Silicon Valley Clean Energy Authority, its partner in several projects, meanwhile, have sued developer EDF Renewables over its termination of contracts for the Big Beau solar and storage project that started generating power last year. EDF in March had asked to increase the price for the project's still unfinished energy storage component by $76.8 million -- a 233% increase, according to the complaint filed May 9 in California state court in Santa Clara County. EDF did not respond to a request for comment. The disruptions have concerned state officials, already dealing with perennial power shortages during peak summer demand. Governor Gavin Newsom said in April that the state had been counting on new battery storage projects, many of which were procured following rolling blackouts in August 2020, to shore up summer reliability.  Delays in the online dates of these projects are a very real concern,  California Public Utilities Commission spokesperson Terrie Prosper said in a statement. OPEN-ENDED PROBLEMEnergy research firm Rystad said that given the large appetite for batteries from a surging EV market, global supplies for utility storage projects are not expected to be able to meet demand in the medium-term. That's a problem, the International Energy Agency says. Battery storage needs to reach 585 GW by 2030 to decarbonize the global power sector, a 35-fold increase from 2020.  If you can't get the batteries manufactured and reliably delivered at a price point that is coming down... you're going to slow the ability of batteries to accelerate the transition,  said Jim Kapsis, founder of climate technology advisory firm the Ad Hoc Group. In Hawaii, utility Hawaiian Electric is seeing delays in solar and storage projects it contracted to help replace the state's only coal-fired power plant, set to retire in September. The developer of four projects, Canada's Innergex Renewable Energy, revealed on a conference call last month that it was seeking to renegotiate the terms of the deals - including price and timing - after receiving force majeure notices from its battery supplier, Tesla. Hawaiian Electric spokesperson Sharon Higa said the utility expected just 39 MW of the 378.5 MW of solar and storage it procured to be in service prior to the AES coal plant retiring. Innergex and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk acknowledged earlier this year in a conference call that the company had prioritized EV battery supplies over stationary storage. Fluence, meanwhile, said in a conference call last month that it has issued force majeure notices on three contracts because its battery suppliers in China were not able to fulfill their obligations. It said it had also raised prices on new contracts by 15% to 25% and would price future contracts based on raw material indices to guard against volatility.",

        "articleBody": "The solar open access installations in India grew by 22 per cent at 513 megawatt (MW) in January-March 2022, according to a report by Mercom India. As of March 2022, cumulative installed solar open access capacity in the open access market was over 5.7 GW, the research firm said in its latest report.  Solar power through 'open access' is an arrangement where a power producer establishes a solar power plant and signs a medium/long term power purchase agreement with a consumer.  To further accelerate India's renewable energy programmes, the government on Tuesday notified the Green Open Access Rules 2022.  These rules are notified for promoting generation, purchase and consumption of green energy including through waste-to-energy plants. It enables a simplified procedure for the open access to green power, the Ministry of Power said.   In Q1 2022 (January-March), India added 513 MW of solar open access capacity, 58 per cent higher QoQ compared to 324 MW installed in Q4 2021. YoY, the installations increased 22 per cent compared to 422 MW in Q1 2021,  the report titled 'Mercom India Solar Open Access Market Report Q1 2022' said.  As of March 2022, the cumulative installed solar capacity in the open access market was over 5.7 GW, the report said, adding that over 2 GW capacity of open access solar projects was under development in the country during the said period.  According to the report, Karnataka topped in additions by accounting for 30 per cent of installations during the quarter. The streamlining of open access regulations, timely DISCOM approvals, early commissioning of projects, and increase in captive projects due to cost-saving benefits drove the open access segment in the state.  Maharashtra with 131 per cent QoQ rise in installations surpassed Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh to become the second largest state for cumulative open access solar installations.  The top five states contributed 86 per cent of all open access installations in Q1 2022.   Commercial and industrial consumers are realizing that open access solar has the dual advantage of climate mitigation and reducing their operating cost. Developers are also wading through policy challenges to ensure consumers reap the benefits. The green energy open access rules could just break this logjam and pave the way for the open access solar market to explode,  Priya Sanjay, Managing Director at Mercom India said.

Technological advances and potential military applications may have renewed government interest in the concept, the researcher noted.Meanwhile, China is not alone planning for a solar plant in space. In March this year, the UK government considered a 16 billion pound proposal to put a pilot solar power plant in space by 2035 with the help of various European defence contractors, including Airbus, the report said.The US military has also reportedly tested related technology on the X-37B space plane while considering a $100 million experiment to power up a remote military outpost as early as 2025.NASA had developed similar plans two decades ago, but shelved due to the complexity and cost of the infrastructure. However, the agency last month said that it was working with the US Air Force on feasibility studies, the report said.",

The initiative will contribute 28,000 MW per annum, which is equivalent to the energy required for the production of over 67,000 cars annually.  Harnessing renewable energy is the need of the hour. We are committed to the Government's vision of making India rich in the use of renewable energy sources,  MSI Managing Director and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said in a statement. The company's efforts are aligned towards encouraging decarbonisation in a bid to bring down emissions, he added.  Our company has been committed to the cause of expanding the use of sustainable energy options to optimise our operations. The power generation from this initiative will constitute over 11.5 per cent of the power requirement of the facility at Manesar,  Takeuchi noted. MSI said it has been harnessing solar energy since 2014 when it installed the first solar power plant of 1 MWp capacity at its Manesar facility, which was later expanded to 1.3 MWp. Taking this initiative ahead, Maruti Suzuki commissioned a 5 MWp carport style photovoltaic solar power plant at its Gurugram facility in 2020. With the new 20 MWp solar plant at Manesar, the company's combined solar power generation capacity, across its plants, now stands at 26.3 MWp. The latest expansion will lead to the avoidance of 20,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. The 20 MWp car-port style solar power plant is designed with the lowest area per unit of power generation, using the East-West direction concept, maximising generation using minimum land. The facility has space to park about 9,000 finished vehicles. A solar carport is an overhead shade designed as a parking area shelter with solar panels mounted on them. MSI's parent company, Suzuki Motor Corporation, in its mid-term management plan, has prioritised carbon reduction in its products and manufacturing processes. Aligned to this plan, the country's largest carmaker is also committed to implementing environmentally friendly initiatives for carbon reduction, it stated. PTI MSS BAL BAL",

        "articleBody": "Cairn Oil & Gas, a unit of mining giant Vedanta Ltd, will convert a pipeline that ships crude oil from its prolific Rajasthan oilfields to Gujarat to solar power by 2025. To commemorate World Environment Day on June 5, Cairn Oil & Gas will convert the Mangala pipeline to solar. It will install solar rooftop PVs in all the 36 Above Ground Installations (AGIs) along the pipeline by 2025, the firm said in a statement.  The Mangala pipeline is the world's longest continuously heated and insulated pipeline that runs from oilfields of Rajasthan to refineries in Gujarat -- traversing 705 km.  Discovered in 2004, Cairn's Mangala oilfield in Barmer district of Rajasthan was the largest global discovery of the year and India's largest onshore discovery in 25 years. The field is also home to the Mangala pipeline -- a technology marvel that was built to make the transportation of waxy crude produced from the prolific oilfield a thriving reality.  Now, this celebrated pipeline is making the solar switch.   In line with its decarbonisation commitment to reduce carbon footprint, Cairn is cutting dependence on more polluting sources of power and setting an important precedent in the industry,  the statement said.  The goal is to shift the complete AGI load to solar energy and make our world's longest continuously heated and insulated hydrocarbon carrying pipeline a greener and more efficient resource.   Before this, the power for AGI operations in the midstream location in Gujarat was fully imported from the state electricity board and its predominantly coal-based power which comes with a much higher greenhouse gas emission intensity.  The firm has already installed a total of 13 AGIs with 15 kilowatt solar rooftop capacity to reduce about 270 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission per year. Further, the plan is to install solar on 10 AGIs each year to complete the project by 2025 and achieve a total reduction of 770 tonnes of carbon emissions per annum.  Discussing the company's initiative to adopt solar power for its celebrated pipeline, Prachur Sah, Deputy CEO, Cairn Oil & Gas, said,  The Mangala pipeline has been a great asset for Cairn Oil & Gas. Its unique technology has allowed the transportation of waxy crude from our Rajasthan fields to refineries in Gujarat.   Mangala pipeline, he said, has been a testimony of industry leading practices, and now its conversion to solar power is pioneering yet another first for the oil and gas industry.  We look forward to several more years of successful production from Barmer and the Mangala pipeline will be the backbone of sustaining our ambitions.   At COP 26 last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India will achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.  In line with the country's ambitious goals, Cairn Oil & Gas has committed to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050.   For this, the company has created a robust ESG road map with a slew of diverse initiatives - the first in the country's oil and gas sector to take this step. In fact, Cairn's decision to convert its much-celebrated Mangala pipeline into a fully solar-operated pipeline flows from this ESG vision,  the statement added.",

At 456 MW, the installations were 34 per cent higher against 341 MW in the first quarter of 2021, the research firm said in a report.  In the Q1 (January-March) of the calendar year 2022, India added 456 MW of rooftop solar capacity, a 13 per cent increase compared to the 402 MW installed in Q4 2021. On a year-over-year basis, installations were up by 34 per cent,  the report titled 'Mercom India Rooftop Solar Market Report Q1 2022' said. During the quarter, 47 per cent of installations were in the industrial segment, followed by 29 per cent, 22 per cent, and 2 per cent, in commercial, residential, and government segments. As of March 31, 2022, India's cumulative rooftop solar capacity was approximately 7.6 gigawatt (GW), Mercom India said. Gujarat is the top state for cumulative solar rooftop installations with about 1.8 GW. Maharashtra and Rajasthan rank second and third, contributing 12 per cent and 10 per cent of total rooftop installations by the end of Q1 2022.  It was a great quarter for the rooftop solar market as post-Covid installations continued to surge. Commercial and industrial segments were again the driving force, accounting for most of the installations. However, future growth is dependent on system costs. If the prices continue to go up and project economics deteriorate, demand is bound to contract in the short term,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. In Q1 2022, the tender activity of rooftop solar projects increased by 269 per cent compared to Q4 2021 and 214 per cent compared to Q1 2021. According to the report, the average cost of a rooftop solar system increased 6 per cent in Q1 2022 compared to Q4 2021. The increase in average rooftop system cost was up 17 per cent year-over-year.",

SJVN today entered into an EPC agreement for 1,000 MW solar project in Bikaner, Rajasthan with M/s Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd,  a company statement said.  The contract agreement was signed in the presence of Nand Lal Sharma, Chairman and Managing Director of SJVN by Chief General Manager (ECD), SJVN S K Sood, and Vepul Jain, Chief - Business Development, Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd.  Sharma said this Rs 5,500 crore-EPC contract is the country's biggest solar contract awarded till date.  The contract includes end-to-end delivery of commissioned solar plant to SJVN including arrangement of land on outright purchase basis, power evacuation system up to the ISTS (inter-state transmission system) sub station, and operation and maintenance of the solar PV plant for three years.  SJVN had secured this 1,000 MW solar project through CPSU scheme of Government of India, Sharma said.  After commissioning, approximately 2,455 million units of electricity will be generated in the first year and 56,838 million units will be generated over a period of 25 years by the project.  With the commissioning of this project, approximately 27,85,077 tonnes of carbon emission is expected to be reduced over the period of 25 years. The project is scheduled to be commissioned by May 2024.  Sharma said,  Recent successive additions of new renewable projects in company's portfolio shows our commitment to empower the nation for expanding its non fossil fuel-based energy and decarbonisation of the economy.   Presently, SJVN has a total portfolio of around 31,500 MW and has diversified and ventured into power transmission and power trading as well. Recent project additions are paving the path for SJVN to achieve the shared vision of 5,000 MW by 2023, 25,000 MW by 2030 and 50,000 MW installed capacity by 2040.",

        "articleBody": "Increased cost of solar modules and steel combined with higher logistics cost will impact 5 giga watt solar capacity under implementation in the private sector, Crisil Ratings said on Wednesday. In a statement, the ratings agency said:  A sharp increase in the prices of solar modules and commodities such as steel, together with rising freight costs, will pull down the Return On Equity (ROE) of nearly a fifth of the 25 GW private solar capacity. This capacity of 5 GW was mostly bid out between October 2020 and December 2021 and is currently under implementation.   The projects totalling 5 GW were bid at relatively low tariffs of less than Rs 2.35 per kilowatt hour (kWh) at a time when module prices were softening and commodity prices benign. These projects may see their ROE falling by as much as 140-180 basis points to around 7 per cent, it said.  In the statement, Manish Gupta, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings, said:  The remaining 20 GW capacity projects will also be hit, but their comparatively higher tariffs and partial cover on cost of modules will limit the impact to 60-80 basis points. Most of these projects are in advanced stages of implementation and have imported or tied up some proportion of modules at prices below the current level.   According to the statement, solar modules contribute in the range of 55-60 per cent to the cost of a solar project, and prices of the same have increased 40 per cent from January last year to March 2022.  Steel contributes 5-10 per cent to the total cost of a solar project, while its rates have risen by 25 per cent during the said period.",

The installation was 50 per cent higher than the 2 GW added in the same period of 2021, the research firm said in a report.  India added over 3 GW of solar capacity in Q1 (January-March) 2022, a 21 per cent rise compared to 2.6 GW in Q4 2021. On a year-on-year basis, installations rose by 50 per cent compared to the 2 GW added in Q1 2021,  the report titled 'Q1 2022 India Solar Market Update by Mercom India Research' said. During Q1 2022, 2.7 GW of large-scale solar was installed, registering a quarter-over-quarter (q-o-q) increase of 23 per cent and a 53 per cent rise on a year-on-year basis. Large-scale solar accounted for 85 per cent of the installations, and rooftop accounted for the remaining 15 per cent during the reporting period. India's cumulative installed solar capacity now stands at 52 GW. The country has a utility-scale projects development pipeline of over 54 GW. Another 33 GW of projects tendered are awaiting auction.  ...A little push from the government can help India surpass the 60 GW large-scale solar installation target set for 2022, which will be a great achievement,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. Rajasthan became the first state to cross 10 GW of cumulative large-scale solar PV installations, with over 10 GW installed as of March 2022, and accounts for 24 per cent of the total installations in the country. In Q1 2022, Rajasthan and Gujarat were the top states for solar, accounting for 52 per cent and 18 per cent of installations, respectively, followed by Karnataka (6 per cent). The report further said that tender activity for solar projects in Q1 2022 declined by about 18 per cent q-o-q from nearly 6 GW in Q4 2021.  With BCD (basic customs duty) applicable from April 1, 2022, on solar cells (25 per cent) and modules (40 per cent), the January-March quarter saw a significant increase in imports of the components,  it said. In Q1 2022, developers procured almost 10 GW of solar modules and stockpiled them ahead of the advent of BCD, which took effect on April 1, as they wanted to avoid paying the additional duty and claim the amount later due to the cumbersome regulatory process.

Most of these projects are in advanced stages of implementation and have imported or tied up some proportion of modules at prices below the current level,\u201d Manish Gupta, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings said.The landed cost of solar modules, has risen unabated by 40% since January 2021, driven by higher commodity prices, primarily of polysilicon and supply chain issues such as shortage of shipping containers, it said.For instance, mono-crystalline modules costed $0.21/kWh in January-February 2021 and were then expected to remain stable or decline marginally. However, by April this fiscal, spot prices had increased to $0.28/ kWh and could remain at this level throughout the year due to strong global demand and continued supply disruptions in China following extended lockdowns amid a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.\u201cHowever, there are three factors that are likely to partially offset the loss on returns - these include better module efficiency, and new revenue streams from carbon credit certificate revenue and lower cost of debt,\u201d Ankit Hakhu, Director, CRISIL Ratings said. The newer technologies of bi-facial and mono-perc modules can lead to higher generation per unit of cost compared to the poly- or multi-crystalline modules that were predominant two years back. This may increase plant load factors (PLFs) by 1.5%, thereby cushioning returns by 130 \u2013 150 basis points.Secondly, the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) focus for corporates \u2014 predominantly mining, oil and energy companies in Europe, North America and Australia \u2014 has given rise to a merchant market for carbon credits.",

        "articleBody": "Thanks to technological and manufacturing advances, costs for solar panels have tumbled in the last decade, making solar energy more popular for homeowners. But figuring out how to add a solar energy system to your roof can be daunting.Workers installed a solar and battery system this winter at my home. It was a major investment but has already begun paying off in lower utility bills and providing peace of mind that we will have at least some electricity during power outages, which are common because storms often knock down power lines.Interest in rooftop solar systems is high and growing as energy prices rise and concerns about climate change mount. Many people are also worried about blackouts caused by extreme weather linked to climate change. If you are interested in solar, here are some things to consider.Can you add solar panels to your roof?This question might seem simple, but finding the answer can be surprisingly complicated. One installer told me that my roof was so shaded by trees that solar panels would not generate enough electricity to make the investment worthwhile. Hearing another opinion was worth it: The installer I hired allayed those concerns and recommended some tree trimming. On sunny days my system often generates more power than my family uses.It can also be difficult to find out what your local government and utility will permit because the information is usually not readily available in plain language. I learned that lesson at my previous home.When I lived in New York City, it took months of research to learn that I couldn\u2019t install panels on my roof. The city requires a large clear area on flat roofs like mine for firefighters to walk on, it turns out. And I couldn\u2019t install solar panels on a canopy \u2014 a rooftop framework that elevates the panels \u2014 because it would violate a city height restriction for homes on my block.The best approach is to cast a wide net and talk to as many solar installers as you can. You might also consult neighbors who have put solar panels on their roofs: People in many parts of the country have banded together in what are known as solarize campaigns to jointly purchase solar panels to secure lower prices from installers.\u201cThat has been really successful in neighborhoods and communities all across the country,\u201d said Gretchen Bradley, community solar manager at Solar One.Can I afford a solar installer?You should seek proposals from several installers. Comparison shopping services like EnergySage and SolarReviews make it easy to contact multiple installers.When reviewing proposals, pay attention to how much the system will cost per watt. This tells you how much you are paying for the system\u2019s electricity-generating capacity and allows you to compare offers.The median quote for new rooftop solar systems is $2.75 per watt, according to EnergySage. That works out to about $26,125 for an average system of 9,500 watts before taking into account a federal tax credit. For the 2022 tax year, the credit stands at 26% of the cost of the solar system; it is slated to drop to 22% in 2023 and end in 2024. Many states, including Arizona, California, New York and Massachusetts, also offer residents incentives to install solar systems, such as rebates and tax breaks.Prices can vary greatly because of location, local labor costs and other factors, like what kind of home you live in and whether other work is needed before installation. If your roof is old or damaged, for example, it might need to be replaced before a solar system can be installed.Rooftop solar systems can reduce monthly utility bills, depending on electricity rates, how much energy a home uses and state policies. Systems that save more money will help buyers recoup their investment faster. Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive and founder of EnergySage, said solar systems should ideally pay for themselves within 10 years.The excess electricity that rooftop systems produce is sent to the electric grid, and utilities typically compensate homeowners for that energy through credits on their monthly bills. The value of those credits varies by state.How should I pay for it?If you can afford to buy a solar system outright, you will get the best deal by paying cash. Systems purchased with loans or through leases tend to cost more, especially over the life of the contract. Shopping around is your best hedge against falling prey to dubious or predatory agreements.The main advantage of leasing a solar energy system is that your costs are typically fixed for the duration of the contract. But experts caution that leases can be hard to get out of and could become a burden when you sell your home, because buyers might not want to take on your contract.Aggarwal noted that leases \u201cmake sense\u201d for some people who may not earn enough to claim the federal tax credit. He suggested that people interested in solar leases get three or four quotes from different installers.Should I buy a battery?Adding a battery to your solar system will allow you to store some of the excess electricity it generates to use during a blackout or in the evening and night. A solar system without a battery will not keep you supplied with power during an outage because most residential systems are automatically turned off when the grid goes down.Batteries can be expensive, especially if you want to run large appliances and provide power for many hours or days. A 10- to 12-kilowatt-hour battery, which can store roughly a third of a home\u2019s typical daily electricity use, costs about $13,000, according to EnergySage.But another reason to buy a battery is that the federal tax credit for rooftop solar systems applies only to the costs of batteries that are purchased with solar panels, and not to batteries added in a different tax year. About 28% of residential solar systems installed in 2021 included batteries, up from 20% in 2020, according to a survey by EnergySage.Can I use my electric car as a backup battery?Most electric cars cannot provide power to homes. Only a few models, like the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Hyundai Ioniq 5, have that ability, and they are in incredibly short supply.But many energy experts believe that it will eventually be common for car batteries to send power back to homes and the electric grid.In many parts of the United States, extended power outages may happen just once or twice a year. As a result, Aggarwal said, it may not make sense to invest in an expensive home battery, which usually holds much less energy than electric-car batteries. \u201cEverybody is starting to talk about using your car to run your home.\u201dIf I can\u2019t install solar panels, can I still buy solar energy?You might be able to join a community solar project, which are usually installed on open land or on the roofs of warehouses and other large buildings.While the rules vary by state, community solar programs generally work in similar ways. Members get two bills a month: one from the community solar project and one from their utility. The projects sell electricity at a discount to the rate charged by your utility, and each kilowatt-hour of power you buy shows up as a credit for a kilowatt-hour of energy on your utility bill.New Yorkers who join a community solar project, for example, can save about 10% on their monthly electricity bill, Bradley said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost anything to sign up or leave a project,\u201d she added.While most states allow community solar, a majority of such projects are in just four states \u2014 Florida, Minnesota, New York and Massachusetts \u2014 according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.You can search for projects in your area on websites including EnergySage and PowerMarket or through state agencies, like the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.",

        "articleBody": "The Delhi government on Thursday organised a national consultation allowing stakeholders to hold discussions for framing the city's solar policy, according to an official statement. Delhi Power Minister Satyendar Jain said the policy consultations, organised regularly by the city government, have led to gathering valuable feedback from stakeholders to formulate an effective and robust solar policy for the national capital.  Through rooftop solar installation, Delhi government will explore innovative mechanisms to effectively manage peak load, which is also complementary to the growth of electric vehicles in the city,  he said.  The customer must be provided with continuous maintenance and proper functioning of the solar panels through the promotion of the RESCO model.  Jain also assured people that rooftop solar installation will not ruin their terrace space and they can put the solar panels at a height of eight to nine feet. Jasmine Shah, the Vice-Chairperson of the Dialogue and Development Commission said,  Delhi's last Solar Policy of 2016 has laid the foundation for rooftop solar adoptions in the city with 83 per cent of total rooftop solar capacity (230 MW) installed since 2016.   The new solar policy will make Delhi the solar capital of India and hopefully, a global case study for how cities can lead the rooftop solar movement. It will also create thousands of new green jobs as envisioned under Delhi's Rozgar Budget,  Shah said. According to the statement, the consultation was aimed at aligning relevant stakeholders in the solar energy ecosystem on a shared vision for Delhi's solar targets and establishing a clear set of actionable next steps to make the city a national and global leader in rooftop solar adoption.",

        "articleBody": "Investments worth USD 7.2 billion will be required in the next three to four years to promote integrated manufacturing of solar modules in India, a report said on Thursday. The push to improve local manufacturing could help domestic module manufacturers clock USD 30 billion (Rs 2.3 lakh crore) in revenues by 2030 from selling 150 GW at Rs 15/Wp (Watt peak) and generate employment opportunity for around 41,000 workers, according to the report released by CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF).   India's push to indigenise the solar manufacturing value chain would require capex investments worth USD 7.2 billion (Rs 53,773 crore) over the next three to four years,  it said.  Rishabh Jain, Programme Lead at CEEW, said that solar energy is the cornerstone of India's goal to establish 500 GW (GigaWatt) of non-fossil-based capacity by 2030 and long-term net-zero ambition.  He noted that the ongoing geopolitical and energy crises point toward the importance of reducing import reliance and developing a reliable and robust domestic supply chain for industries critical to the energy transition.  To promote domestic solar manufacturing, the government has already announced multiple measures over FY 2021-22, including allocating USD 3.2 billion (Rs 24,000 crores) through the production-linked incentives scheme and levying a basic customs duty of 25 per cent and 40 per cent on all imports of solar cells and modules, respectively.",

        "articleBody": "Rising concerns over energy security and climate change will galvanize record new capacity to generate renewable power in 2022, the International Energy Agency forecast on Wednesday. The IEA forecasts that 320 gigawatts will come online this year, equivalent to top European economy Germany's total annual demand, up from a previous record of 295 gigawatts in 2021. Last year's additions, which were driven by growth of solar energy in China and Europe, exceeded the Paris-based agency's expectations it said in a new report on renewables.  Energy market developments in recent months - especially in Europe - have proven once again the essential role of renewables in improving energy security, in addition to their well-established effectiveness at reducing emissions,  IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have driven inflation to multi-decade highs and led to soaring energy prices in some advanced economies, leaving policymakers scrambling to find cheaper and reliable energy. But the growth of renewable power has been hampered by supply chain difficulties, the IEA added, saying that the cost of installing solar photovoltaic (PV) panels will remain high this year and next due to higher commodity and freight prices. Before the coronavirus crisis, prices for solar power had been declining for a decade, the IEA said. And in the absence of stronger policies, the growth of renewables is expected to plateau next year as progress in solar power is offset by a 40% decline in hydropower expansion and stagnant growth in wind power generation. Renewables growth was led by China, the European Union and Latin America in 2021, the IEA said, but it had lagged in the United States.  The U.S. outlook is clouded by uncertainty over new incentives for wind and solar and by trade actions against solar PV imports from China and Southeast Asia,  it added. ",

        "articleBody": "The Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) of Delhi will hold a national consultation on the city's new solar policy on May 12 to help identify barriers and challenges to deployment of solar rooftop in commercial, industrial and residential buildings. A government statement said on Friday that the DDC has partnered with RMI India to develop a framework to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy solutions in Delhi, especially solar energy.  RMI India will support DDC Delhi in tapping into global best practices and enable Delhi to become the leading state in terms of Rooftop Solar (RTS) adoption, it said.   Both organisations will also be hosting a National Consultation on Delhi's new Solar Policy in collaboration with the Power Department at the India International Centre (IIC) on May 12,  it said.  Jasmine Shah, Vice-Chairperson, DDC Delhi, said, the consultations are expected to help the Delhi Government identify barriers and challenges to deployment of solar rooftop in commercial, industrial and residential buildings.  These consultations will provide an opportunity to ideate on potential solutions to these challenges and obtain specific inputs on the steps that need to be taken to ensure effective implementation,  he added.  The Delhi Government has laid out an ambitious jobs plan through the Rozgar Budget of creating 20 lakh jobs in five years, Shah said.   The Rozgar Budget lays a special emphasis on generating green jobs including 40,000 new jobs in the next five years in solar renewable energy. This collaboration will go a long way in tapping into global best practices and ensuring that Delhi emerges as the national and global leader in terms of rooftop solar adoption,  he added.  The Delhi government had notified the Delhi Solar Policy 2016 to promote the adoption of rooftop solar units in residential as well as commercial buildings, which kick-started the adoption of solar energy in Delhi at a mass scale.  The Delhi Solar Policy 2016 expired in 2021 and it was subsequently announced in the Rozgar Budget 2022 that the Delhi Government will come up with a new solar policy in 2022 that will position the city as a national and global leader in rooftop solar generation, while simultaneously generating 40,000 green jobs.",

        "articleBody": "Nothing makes you appreciate air-conditioning like high summer in India. Here in Delhi, temperatures are running over 100 degrees for much of the day, with two full months still to go before the cooling monsoon rains arrive. Unfortunately, just as everyone decided to crank up their ACs or at least their ceiling fans, electricity supply collapsed under the strain in large parts of the country.This is not, sadly, a rare occurrence. It happens almost every summer and on other occasions when power demand spikes. There\u2019s no clearer evidence that India\u2019s electricity sector, dominated by coal-guzzling power plants and state-run utilities, simply isn\u2019t up to the job. And the problem is only going to get worse: India has rapidly electrified in recent years and peak power demand has been growing between 8% and 10% a year.The reasons for these successive power crises are almost always the same. Thermal power plants produce three-fourths of India\u2019s electricity. But they can never seem to get their hands on enough coal.Sometimes the generation companies can\u2019t pay for coal shipments because they, in turn, have not been paid by India\u2019s improvident electricity distribution companies. Sometimes Coal India Ltd., the state-run behemoth that produces 80% of India\u2019s coal supply, doesn\u2019t produce as much as promised, whether because its miners are on strike or for other reasons. Sometimes the coal has been dug out of the ground but left at the pithead because Indian Railways can\u2019t organize enough wagons or locomotives. Sometimes protesters disrupt the long national coal supply chain. Sometimes the imported coal some plants prefer isn\u2019t available or shipments are late.Whatever the reason, the result is that India, famously dependent on coal, has coal-fired plants that run at between 50% and 70% capacity even at times of peak demand. Combined with the low tariffs set by long-term power purchase agreements, as well as chronically delayed payments, this means the entire business is unremunerative. Unsurprisingly, nobody wants to invest in the sector.Ordinary Indians are paying the price. Last month, utilities in the industrial state of Gujarat were forced to buy electricity from the spot market at three or four times the usual price, even as thermal power plants locally were operating at only 45% capacity.It has long been conventional wisdom in India that the country must continue to depend on coal because \u2014 unlike, say, crude oil \u2014 we are sitting on huge reserves. Understandably, we don\u2019t want to be entirely dependent upon imported energy. Energy security means macroeconomic stability.Yet the fact is that India\u2019s coal-fired fleet hasn\u2019t been designed to take advantage of domestic coal. Back when many of these plants were planned a decade or more ago, they were expected to use Indonesian or even Australian coal because those supplies were available quickly, while India\u2019s coal resources were difficult to exploit.Imported coal is now much more expensive and supply is no longer reliable. But cheaper domestic coal often isn\u2019t of the quality many plants are designed to handle; in 2017, the federal minister in charge complained that a third of India\u2019s coal-based capacity depended on imported coal. According to research in 2020 from Stanford University economist Gireesh Shrimali, about the same proportion of these plants cost more to run than the levelized cost of solar power in India.As many analysts have since pointed out, the situation cries out for more global investment in India to retire coal, buy out existing contracts, compensate affected communities and switch to renewables. After all, power crises hit India when temperatures are at their highest and the sun is shining. (Admittedly, current solar power cells tend to work less efficiently at high temperatures.)India cannot keep relying on its hopelessly inefficient thermal power plant network. The government\u2019s own energy maps make clear how unfit for purpose it is. While efficient modern plants are located along the coasts and near ports, domestic coal reserves are far inland. Geography means that getting domestic coal to newer power plants will always be a problem.Unlike China, India has significantly scaled back its plans to expand its coal fleet. There are worries that the current crisis will cause a minor reversal in these plans and lead to new plants being commissioned. But that\u2019s obviously not going to solve what is a structural problem.Indians need to look at our dependence on coal-fired electricity with an objective eye. Far from being cheap and reliable, it too often winds up being pricier than it should be and absent when we need it most. Whatever else coal might provide India, it isn\u2019t energy security.",

        "articleBody": "Shell Overseas Investment B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell plc (Shell), today signed an agreement with Actis Solenergi Limited (Actis) to acquire 100% of Solenergi Power Private Limited for $1.55 billion and with it, the Sprng Energy group of companies.ET was the first to report on 10 January 2022, about the deal. Sprng Energy supplies solar and wind power to electricity distribution companies in India. Its portfolio consists of 2.9 gigawatts-peak (GWp) of assets (2.1 GWp operating and 0.8 GWp contracted) with a further 7.5 GWp of renewable energy projects in the pipeline.\u201cThis deal positions Shell as one of the first movers in building a truly integrated energy transition business in India,\u201d said Wael Sawan, Shell\u2019s Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions Director.\u201cI believe it will enable Shell to become a leader across the power value chain in a rapidly growing market where electrification on a massive scale and strong demand for renewables are driving the energy transition, Sawan added.The solar and wind assets Shell acquires through the deal will triple Shell\u2019s present renewable capacity in operation and help deliver its Powering Progress strategy.  91195568An important part of this strategy is to develop a best-in-class integrated power business, which will help Shell to reach its target of becoming a profitable net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to close later in 2022, Shell said.Shell's offer, valuing the portfolio at $1.75-$1.8 billion, inclusive of its debt, is said to higher than Singapore\u2019s Sembcorp Industries Ltd, the only other contender who made a binding offer from a field of six who were earlier picked from the original list of 17 for due diligence, Et reported.The final six included Adani Group, Canadian pension fund CPP Investment Board (CPPIB) and steelmaker ArcelorMittal.Actis has a significant track record of investing in Indian renewables where it has invested $800 million over the last 7 years to establish Ostro Energy and Sprng Energy with 3 GW of solar and wind capacity.The UK based Actis had sold its first clean energy platform in India - Ostro Energy to ReNew Power Ventures in 2018 at an enterprise value of $1.5 billion.The Sprng acquisition will be the biggest renewable energy entry in India by Shell. Till date, Shell has investments in India including owning a 49% stake in solar power producer Cleantech Solar Energy and a minority exposure in Bihar based rural distributed utility company Husk Power Systems via Shell Technology Ventures, its VC arm.Sprng is an Actis Energy 4 fund investment. In October 2021 Actis announced its latest fund, Actis Energy 5, had closed with $6 billion of investable capital, which will be used to mobilise further capital towards the global energy transition.\u201cSprng\u2019s growth and success in India is further evidence of our ability to build market leading sustainable infrastructure anywhere in the world, while still delivering competitive returns for our investors,  said Lucy Heintz, Partner, Head of Energy Infrastructure at Actis. \u201cSprng is a best-in-class energy platform delivering clean, reliable power to millions of people across India. We remain committed to the Indian market and its ecological transition, and we hope to deploy a further US$1 billion in the region by the end of 2026,\u201d said Sanjiv Aggarwal, Partner, Energy Infrastructure at Actis.

        "articleBody": "ReNew Power on Thursday said it has signed five power purchase agreements (PPAs) for the supply of around 1,500 MW electricity generated from solar plants. The company has signed PPAs with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL), as well as multiple long-term purchase agreements with corporate buyers together totalling around 2 GW, a company statement said.  This has seen the company's gross total portfolio jumping to 12.1 GW from 10.2 GW at the beginning of this calendar year.  The new utility solar projects will be located in the western state of Rajasthan and have flat tariffs over 25 years.  Four solar PPAs have been signed with SECI and one with PSPCL. Two PPAs of 600 MW and 375 MW are under the SECI Rajasthan IV scheme, where ReNew will supply electricity at Rs 2.18/kWh.  The other two PPAs with SECI for 300 MW and 100 MW are under the SECI IX scheme and have a tariff of Rs 2.37/kWh.  The ReNew recently acquired a beneficial interest in the 300 MW (SECI IX) and 375 MW (SECI Rajasthan IV) projects, subject to the terms of the respective PPAs.  For the PSPCL PPA of 100 MW, ReNew will supply electricity at Rs 2.33/kWh. All the projects are expected to be commissioned by the fourth calendar quarter of 2023.  Corporate buyers have signed long-term agreements with ReNew for the purchase of clean energy or renewable energy credits for approximately 0.5 GW (491 MW), with energy tariffs ranging between Rs 3.06 to Rs 3.95/kWh.  The corporates include a large US-based global tech major, Grasim Industries, and Netmagic, a subsidiary of NTT Communications, Japan.  This takes ReNew's overall corporate portfolio to over 900 MW, making it one of the largest renewable energy solutions providers to corporates, it stated.  ReNew Chairman and CEO Sumant Sinha, said,  The addition of 1.9 GW comfortably above our threshold returns is a testament to ReNew's competitive advantages.   ReNew recently also announced an investment by Mitsui & Co. Ltd in its 1.3 GW round-the-clock renewable energy project, and a joint venture with Indian Oil Corporation and Larsen & Toubro for developing green hydrogen capacity in India.",

Although financing activity was strong quarter-on-quarter with robust demand for solar assets, significant headwinds are building up that can slow the momentum considerably. Continuing supply chain issues, higher inflation, and the interest rate trajectory going forward are already major concerns,  Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said. ",

        "articleBody": "Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit, the 500-Kilowatt Solar Plant at Palli Panchayat in Jammu and Kashmir's Samba district has been completed in a record time of 20 days, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday. Singh, accompanied by Central Electronics Limited chairman and Managing director Prakash Jain, visited the plant and inspected the trial run of the newly installed solar plant, which will make the village with about 340 houses the first in the Union Territory to become carbon neutral. The successful trial run of the solar plant was demonstrated to the minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office at the site.  The 500 Kilowatt Solar Plant installed on a total area of 6,408 square metres was completed in a record time of 20 days that will provide clean electricity and light to 340 houses in the Panchayat,  the minister said. He said a 25-member team worked round the clock to complete the Rs 2.75 crore project. The electricity generated will be distributed to the village, having a daily requirement of about 2,000 units through the local grid power station. The Prime Minister will inaugurate the solar plant during his scheduled visit to the Palli Panchayat on the occasion of National Panchayati Raj Day on April 24. He will also address a gathering, including more than 30,000 Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) members of Jammu and Kashmir. PRIs from across the country will also be connected virtually for the Prime Minister's address. Around 20 stalls at the exhibition venue of the Prime Minister's programme are being put up by various departments and wings of the Union Ministry of Science and Technology, which will display the latest technologies and innovations beneficial for rural areas and farming. Singh said a series of meetings were held in New Delhi between Union Ministers Jitendra Singh and Giriraj Singh to fine-tune exhibition themes for the Modi's Jammu event during the last fortnight. Some of the themes identified -- poverty and enhanced village livelihood, Healthy village, Child-friendly village, Water sufficient village, Clean and green village, Self-sufficient infrastructure in the village, Engendered development in the village to be implemented by different departments of the Science Ministry -- will bring about a revolutionary transformation in augmenting the household income of the rural populace, he said. The minister said stalls demonstrating best agriculture practices -- be it DBT's Bio-Tech Kisan Scheme, drone farming -- will be supplemented by the Centre's and UT government's innovative initiatives for the welfare of farmers. Stalls exhibiting Aroma Mission and Purple Revolution, Floriculture mission, modern uses of Bamboo, waste-water management will also be set up, he said, adding that stalls showcasing the integration of Science and Technology with the themes of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj will be put up for the benefit of the common man. The minister said instead of having conventional stalls at the event, efforts are being made to showcase the latest technology, which can add value to farmers' income and science-based demonstration with Panchayati Raj features. Among important innovations planned to be showcased are geospatial technology for rural development and farmers, apps usable by farmers for the weather forecast for five days, lavender cultivation -- famously known as the purple revolution, biotechnology innovation to increase the produce of apple, drone application for pesticide spray and waste treatment and shelf life of fruits to be increased through atomic radiation.",

        "articleBody": "India is projected to fall  well short  of its target for 2022 of having 100 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar capacity, largely due to slow uptake of rooftop solar, a new report by JMK Research and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said on Tuesday.As of December 2021, India's cumulative installed solar capacity was 55GW, with grid-connected utility-scale projects contributing 77 per cent and the balance coming from grid-connected rooftop solar (20 per cent) and mini or micro off-grid projects (three per cent).With just eight months of 2022 remaining, only about 50 per cent of the 100GW target, consisting of 60GW of utility-scale and 40GW of rooftop solar capacity, has been met.Approximately 19GW of solar capacity is expected to be added in 2022 -- 15.8GW from utility-scale and 3.5GW from rooftop solar. Even with this capacity addition, about 27 per cent of India's 100GW solar target would be unmet,  says report co-author Jyoti Gulia, Founder, JMK Research.The report projects that by December 2022 there will be a 25GW shortfall in the 40GW rooftop solar target, compared to just 1.8GW in the utility-scale solar target. Utility-scale solar capacity addition is on track. India is set to achieve nearly 97 per cent of its 60GW target,  says Gulia.  This makes it imperative to have a more concerted effort towards expanding rooftop solar. Headwinds ranging from pandemic-induced supply chain disruption to deeply rooted policy restrictions have impeded the growth of India's rooftop solar (onsite solar power) and open access solar (offsite solar) installations. The anticipated 27GW shortfall from the 2022 solar target can be attributed to a string of challenges which are slowing overall progress on renewable energy targets,  says co-author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and Lead India, IEEFA.On the current trajectory, the report finds India's solar target of 300GW by 2030 will be off the mark by about 86GW.These challenges include: regulatory roadblocks; net metering limits; the twin burdens of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported cells and modules and issues with the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM); unsigned power supply agreements and banking restrictions; financing issues plus delays in or rejection of open access approval grants; and the unpredictability of future open access charges. Central and state government policies and regulations must be aligned to support the solar sector overall, and especially the ailing rooftop and open access segments of the market,  says co-author Akhil Thayillam, Senior Research Associate, JMK Research.The report proposes short- and long-term measures to get India back on track to meet solar targets.The short-term measures include uniform policies to apply nationally for at least the next five years and consistent regulations for net metering and banking facilities, also to apply nationally.In the long-term, stricter enforcement of the renewable purchase obligation and improved financial health, and potentially privatisation, of distribution companies (discoms).In rooftop solar, state-level efforts such as Gujarat's Surya Scheme need to be replicated by other states in the short-term to help in boosting capacity, says Gulia. It is also likely that the government, in the short-term, will push aggressively for expediting solar capacity addition to achieve the 100GW target by 2022 by re-allocating some of the unmet rooftop target to utility-scale generation.

        "articleBody": "Tata Power arm Tata Power Renewables has commissioned a 300 MW solar plant in Dholera, Gujarat with the country's largest single-axis solar tracker system.  Tata Power Renewables Energy Ltd (TPREL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power, has commissioned a 300 MW project in Dholera, Gujarat. It is India's largest single-axis solar tracker system,  a company statement said.  The project will generate 774 MUs (million units) annually. Along with this, it will reduce approximately 704340 MT/year (tonnes per annum) of carbon emission.  The installation entails 873012 Monocrystalline PV Modules.  Despite the various COVID-19 challenges faced by the industry, TPREL through Tata Power's EPC arm Tata Power Solar Systems Limited has successfully completed the project within the project timelines.  Tata Power managed customized installation, based on the geographical locations and land conditions. The total area used for the installation is 1320 Acre divided into six different plots of 220 acres each.  The weather conditions at the site during the construction period were unpredictable due to very heavy rains leading to the 33 KV cable trench being submerged in water.  However, with the help of floaters, the execution team laid HT Cables at the location. Pre-cast ballasts were also used to lay power cables 500 mm above the ground, instead of conventional underground laying. Despite challenges like weather, machinery, and manpower movement, the project was commissioned successfully.   Commissioning of India's largest single-axis solar tracker system of 300 MW Solar plant at Dholera in Gujarat within the set timelines is a proud moment for Tata Power. Our technical expertise and project execution skills will further solidify our position in the solar EPC space and help India lead the way in renewable energy growth,  Dr. Praveer Sinha, CEO & Managing Director, Tata Power, said.  With the addition of 300 MW, the renewables capacity in operation for Tata Power will now be 3,400 MW with 2,468 MW of Solar and 932 MW of Wind. Tata Power's total Renewable capacity is 5,020 MW including 1,620 MW of Renewable projects under various stages of implementation.",

        "articleBody": "Generating solar energy to recharge electric vehicle (EV) batteries would be a far more efficient use of land than growing crops for ethanol, according to a new report of Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).Notably, India has set a target of 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025. This will require doubling of ethanol from sugar and quadrupling of ethanol from grains in just four years, the report claimed.\u201cWhile surpluses may be sufficient for the component of new ethanol earmarked for sugar, up to 30,000 sq km of land may be needed for the additional ethanol planned for grains (maize),\u201d IEEFA said.The report shows that matching the distance driven by EVs recharged from one hectare of solar generation would require ethanol derived from up to 251 hectares of sugar cane or 187 hectares of maize \u2013 even accounting for losses from electricity transmission, battery charging and grid storage.Enhancing goals for EV uptake could meet many of the goals set out in India\u2019s Roadmap for Ethanol Blending \u2013 cutting emissions and air pollution, supporting domestic agricultural demand, and reducing the drain on India\u2019s foreign exchange by limiting oil imports \u2013 while using a fraction of the land, according to the report.\u201cThis large-scale diversion of agricultural land for ethanol blending conflicts with other key priorities for food production, water use and renewable energy adoption,\u201d says report author and guest contributor Dr Charles Worringham.\u201cWhile the government\u2019s promotion of ethanol blending in petrol may seem like a way to ease the burden of soaring crude oil prices, it further increases the pressure on agricultural land just as the war in Ukraine threatens the world\u2019s grain supply. This intensifies the competition between energy and food and raises the stakes for wise land use in India significantly.\u201cAlthough Russia has an 11% share of global oil exports, 26% of wheat exports come from Russia and Ukraine, and 16% of corn exports. In the end, food trumps energy for claims on arable land if the food supply comes under pressure.\u201d Future threats to agricultural production in South Asia have been reinforced by the recent IPCC Working Group II report, underlining the critical importance of wise land use in India.\u201cA re-evaluation of the ethanol-blending policy and alternatives is needed urgently given that its targets have been brought forward to 2025 from 2030,\u201d says Worringham.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s renewable energy ministry has backed a demand to shield some projects from impending taxes on solar equipment imports, after generators said the added costs will slow the nation\u2019s shift to clean energy. \u201cWe have requested Ministry of Finance to consider grandfathering of basic customs duty for projects bid out before March 9, 2021,\u201d the renewable energy ministry said in response to emailed queries, indicating support for exempting these projects.The levies, effective from April 1, could jeopardize solar projects with a combined capacity of 28 gigawatts, according to the National Solar Energy Federation of India. The industry group has asked the government to shield projects awarded before March 9 last year, when the plan was officially announced, from the higher costs to keep them viable.The import taxes -- 40% for modules and 25% for cells -- are aimed at encouraging greater domestic manufacturing of solar equipment. The federation, however, estimates they will add to power bills and slow the country\u2019s efforts to move away from coal, which accounts for more than two-thirds of electricity generation.\u201cSuch incremental costs will have an adverse impact on the perception of the renewable energy industry, which is seen as a cost-effective alternative to conventional sources of energy,\u201d the group said in a letter to Renewable Energy Minister Raj Kumar Singh. Without any tax relief, some projects might not get commissioned, it said.India plans to expand its solar capacity to 280 gigawatts by the end of this decade from about 51 gigawatts now, but its manufacturing capacity can only currently meet around half of that requirement. The government has also approved a list of companies that are allowed to supply cells and modules, with all of the firms either having manufacturing facilities in the country or planning to build them. However, it\u2019s not clear when this will be implemented.Local capacity to make higher-wattage modules is low, meaning power companies may need to keep importing them, even after the taxes take effect, said Rohit Gadre, an analyst at BloombergNEF in New Delhi. Some power producers have stockpiled modules, with imports in the five months through January doubling from the year-earlier period, he said. India\u2019s solar sector has grown rapidly over the past few years, with most cells and modules coming from China. Sensing the opportunity, domestic players are jumping into the market.Adani Group, Tata Power Co., Vikram Solar Ltd. and Waaree Energies Ltd. are among the top local manufacturers. Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd. has also pledged to build solar equipment plants. ",

        "articleBody": "The \u20b919,500 crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for solar power equipment is likely to be split into two or three buckets to include various companies that are at different levels of indigenous module making.A senior government official said the scheme could be revised based on power and renewable energy minister R K Singh's interaction with the industry last week.  We can divide the PLI into different buckets for polysilicon-to-modules making, wafers to modules and cells to modules manufacturing. This will promote manufacturing of all the components and include more players,  the official said.There are four stages in module making - polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules. India's existing 15 Gw production capacity has no polysilicon or wafer production capacity.The pilot round of the scheme with \u20b94,500 crore budgetary allocation was proposed to promote the integration of the process and was awarded to three companies - Reliance New Energy, Shirdi Sai Electricals and Jindal India Solar - that committed module manufacturing from polysilicon.During the interaction, the industry demanded dilution of local value addition and efficiency requirements. It has asked the government to introduce the two clauses in a graded manner.The concept note floated by the ministry of new and renewable energy proposed to prescribe a minimum 90% local value addition and 22% module performance to be eligible for the scheme.",

        "articleBody": "Air pollution is not just taking a toll on health but also holding India back from achieving its solar energy goals, says a study carried out by Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. It says the country lost 29% of its utilisable \u2018global horizontal irradiance potential\u2019, or the radiation that generates solar power, due to air pollution between 2001 and 2018. This gap in harnessing potential solar energy is equivalent to an annual loss of $245-835 million.IIT considered both the \u2018soiling effect\u2019, or presence of solid dust, and \u2018atmospheric attenuation\u2019, or the scattering of light due to gaseous pollutants in the air, to assess pollution. The study asserts that India could have generated more clean energy and relied less on fossil fuels for power had it met its clean air targets. As it is, the study says, urban haze caused an 11.5% loss in solar radiation falling on a surface in Delhi during 2016-17, causing a loss of about $20 million. 90280966\u201cSuccessful implementation of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and complete mitigation of household emissions through the supply of cleaner fuel for domestic use and rural electrification would allow India to generate a surplus electricity of 6-16 TWh (terawatt hour) per year from the existing solar power installed capacity in 2018. This translates to an economic benefit of $325-845 million annually,\u201d says the study entitled \u2018Cleaner air would enhance India\u2019s annual solar energy production by 6-28 TWh\u2019 written by Dr Sagnik Dey, Dilip Ganguly, Somnath Baidya Roy and others from the Centre for Atmospheric Science, IIT-D. To achieve its goal, the study urges for the \u201csuccessful implementation\u201d of three government programmes: Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Grameen Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) for reducing household emission, and NCAP to tackle ambient air pollution. The study asserts that PMUY and DDUGJY can generate a surplus of 3-8 TWh per year, worth $163-425, while meeting the NCAP target would generate another 3-8 TWh per year. The study pointed out that the combined benefits from these three policies were worth $325-845 million, or almost the equivalent of the budget allocation of $1,100 million for PMUY and $42.6 million for the first two years of NCAP.It also estimates the potential benefits of India meeting WHO\u2019s guidelines on clean air of 10 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic metres at a surplus of 10-28 TWh per year, resulting in incremental revenue of $505-1,425 million annually. The study also said that generation of this surplus energy would be more pronounced in the eastern and north-eastern power grids because the population in those regions relied extensively on fossil fuel and biomass burning for day-to-day activities.",

        "articleBody": "The solar manufacturing industry is providing 29,900 new jobs every year based on the installed capacity, the government informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. Under solar manufacturing, module and capacity as of date is 11,500 MW, Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy Bhagwanth Khuba said.  One MW provides 2.6 jobs per year and based on that annual jobs per year is 29,900,  he said. The government is also providing training under programmes and by February 2022, around 62,000 people were trained. The minister was replying to a query of YSRCP member V Vijayasai Reddy on the steps taken by the government for penetration of renewable energy projects in rural area and how much employment has been generated. Khuba further said the government is eager to construct solar power parks in various states. It will fulfil the demands of the state government and help in this regard. Power Minister R K Singh, who was also present in the Upper House, said the government already has a PLI (production-linked inventive) scheme for solar manufacturing here of about Rs 8,500 MW. The Union finance minister has now announced a second PLI scheme in the budget of Rs 19,500 crore, he added.  For that also, we are going to come out with a bid,  he said, adding,  This is not the only step which we are taking. We have also set up a tariff barrier . Now import of module from other countries will attract a custom duty of 40 per cent and sales a custom duty of 20 per cent, the Union minister said without naming the country.  We already have some manufacturing capacity of 15,000 MW and we want to scale it up. We want to emerge as an exporter of the module,  he said. As far as 'Make-in-India' is concerned, the country has made some progress and there would be even more progress in that, he added. The minister further informed that India has solar parks worth 30,000 MW and adding more in that as projects are coming in that. According to an analysis brought out in January 2022 by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, Natural Resources Defence Council and Skill Council for Green Jobs, the cumulative 81 GW renewable energy capacity addition has created an estimated 1,11,400 'Full-Time Equivalent' employment across various project phases as of August 2021, he said. T G Venkatesh of the BJP highlighted the problems faced by power generators. The state governments are delaying the incentives given by the Centre and the tribunal and sectoral regulators are delaying the judgement over the wheeling charges and other issues, he said. Replying to it, Union minister Singh said,  We have meetings with the forum of regulators... We have emphasised to them as they should not set up unnecessary hurdles in setting up of renewable energy and pendency in their courts must come down. The government has also pointed out to the regulators, which has a large number of cases pending before them.  We have a system of monitoring of cases with the regulators,  he said, adding  This is a problem which we are aware of . Singh also added India has achieved its target of having 40 per cent of its energy requirement from non-fossil fuel, nine years in advance in November 2021.  Our rate of growth of renewable energy is the fastest in the world and continue to be the fastest,  he said, adding  we will reach the target of 500-gigawatt (GW). ",

LFP is fast gaining as one of the leading cell chemistries due to its cobalt and nickel free batteries, low cost and longer life compared to NMC and other chemistries,  said Mukesh Ambani, chairman, RIL, adding that Lithium Werks is one of the leading LFP cell manufacturing companies globally and has a vast patent portfolio and a management team which brings tremendous experience of innovation across LFP value chain.The acquisition will include the entire patent portfolio of Lithium Werks, manufacturing facility in China, key business contracts and hiring of existing employees as a going concern.Joe Fisher, co-founder and CEO of Lithium Werks, said,  This deal means increased resources and expanded global reach, while leveraging our experienced team and IP portfolio and providing scale and momentum to help drive our product innovation, capacity expansion and accelerate our clean energy strategy. RNEL, which last December signed a definitive agreement to pick up a 100% stake in UK-based global battery technology company Faradion Ltd for \u00a3100 million, sees Lithium Werks along with Faradion strengthening its technology portfolio and providing it access to one of the world's leading portfolio of LFP patents.Faradion's patent technology is sustainable as it does not use cobalt, lithium, copper or graphite, while sodium is the sixth most available element in the world.  Along with Faradion, Lithium Werks will enable us to accelerate our vision of establishing India at the core of developments in global battery chemistries and help us provide a secure, safe and high-performance supply chain to the large and growing Indian EV and energy storage markets,  said Ambani, adding that RNEL is progressing towards establishing an end-to-end battery manufacturing and supply ecosystem for India markets.The transaction is subject to certain regulatory and other customary closing conditions and is expected to complete by June 2022.",

        "articleBody": "Australia's two richest men joined a A$210 million ($152 million) capital raising for an ambitious project to supply Singapore with solar power via an undersea cable, the company said on Monday. Private companies of Andrew Forrest, founder of iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, and Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-founder of software maker Atlassian Plc , upped their investments, the parties said, as the Sun Cable project inches toward becoming a supplier of renewable energy to the region. Forrest is Australia's richest man and Cannon-Brookes is Australia's second richest, according to the 2021 Rich List from the Australian Financial Review. Their involvement in the project reflects a mutual interest in playing a part in a global transition to sustainable energy, although their disclosed contributions leave it unclear how the project, which has been costed at more than A$20 billion ($14.5 billion), will ultimately be bankrolled.  Sun Cable's vision will transform Australia's capability to become a world-leading generator and exporter of renewable electricity and enable decarbonisation,  said Forrest in a statement. This capital raise is a critical step.  Cannon-Brookes, who recently failed in an attempt to buy top Australian power producer AGL Energy with plans to speed up its exit from fossil fuel, said the raising  brings Australia one step closer to realising our renewables exporting potential . Sun Cable says its Australia-Asia Power Link will from 2027 harness solar energy from the world's largest solar farm and battery facility in Australia's Northern Territory, and export it via a 5,000 km (3,109 mile) undersea transmission system to Singapore and beyond. The project aims to provide Singapore with up to 15% of its energy requirements. Indonesia last September granted the company a permit to conduct an underwater survey starting immediately after it committed to investing $2.5 billion in the country.  This capital raise will enable the delivery of renewable solar power from Australia to Singapore, advance our other multi gigawatt scale projects, and support the progress of key facilitating assets,  Sun Cable boss David Griffin said. The company was not immediately available for comment about how it would achieve its full funding requirements. The company in 2019 said Cannon-Brookes and Forrest had injected less than $50 million in the project. It did not specify their individual contribution in the latest round.",

        "articleBody": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) cell manufacturer Jupiter International has raised \u20b9170 crore from funds managed by wealth management firm Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisors (EAAA). The funds will be utilised as growth capital to enhance its manufacturing capacity, the Kolkata-based company said on Sunday.The company plans to set up a new greenfield capacity of 2,000 megawatt (MW) integrated cell plus module line, said Alok Garodia, managing director of Jupiter International.  Jupiter Group is in the process of rapid expansion,  he said.  The backing from Edelweiss which is one of the largest funds in India is crucial for us at this stage.  This is on top of a new 500 MW cell line based on the latest monocrystalline PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) technology being built.  We will commission the new 500 MW mono PERC cell manufacturing facility in the next six months,  Garodia said.The fresh capital was raised through a combination of debt and convertible-to-equity instrument. Centrum Capital was the exclusive advisor to Jupiter International on this transaction.  Demand for domestic solar cells is at the cusp of an exceptional growth phase fuelled by favourable government policies,  said Kriti Mohan Ghosh, executive vice president at Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisor.  Jupiter Group, with more than a decade of track record as a manufacturer of high-quality cells, is uniquely positioned to capitalise on the market opportunity. Garodia said the company has plans to expand further in states that offer higher incentives to set up plant. It expects to clock a turnover of \u20b9350 crore in the current financial year and targets to take it to \u20b9600 crore in FY23.Since the implementation of WTO-compliant Domestic Content Requirement (DCR) policy two years back, the government has taken up a slew of initiatives including levy of basic customs duty (BCD) and production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to promote solar equipment manufacturing in the country. In the last few months, leading players in the solar manufacturing sector have announced expansion plans. Several new strategic players are also in the process of foraying into the solar manufacturing value chain, giving a fillip to government plans to establish a domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem.",

Cost of installing 1 MW of Solar power will be around Rs 3.5 crore.The corporation is likely to finalise the tender by March 20 and the work will commence in April 2022, the official said. The place of installing the solar power plant will be finalised following the recommendation of the consultant of the project based on the climatic conditions. The official said that for installing 1 MW of power, five acres of land is required and for the 20000 MW power plant, around 1,00,000 acres of land will be needed. The Chief Minister's office has already directed the district collectors to identify land parcels, the corporation said.Tamil Nadu Power Department is expecting to complete the construction of a 1000 MW power plant by the end of the year. Tangedco has put a deadline of 2030 to complete the 20,000 MW project.In Tamil Nadu, the total installed power capacity is 37,500 MW, of which 15,250 MW is procured through renewable sources of energy, the corporation official said.Tangedco has at present small solar power plants that are installed at rooftops and are purchasing power from private producers at Rs 7.01 per unit. Another major necessity that Tangedco will face is the storage batteries -- as at present, the corporation has batteries to store power up to 1 MW only.The corporation will have to procure batteries to store 20,000 MW of power that will be generated once all the solar plants are commissioned by 2030, the official said.",

        "articleBody": "India and Sri Lanka have signed an agreement for developing a 100 megawatt solar power plant in the island nation's eastern port district of Trincomalee, as part of the efforts to strengthen bilateral economic partnership, including through cooperation in the renewable energy sector. The signing ceremony took place on Friday at the Ministry of Finance of Sri Lanka for the plant in the country's Eastern province.  The Joint Venture and Shareholders' Agreement (JVSHA) for the Trincomalee Power Company Limited (TPCL) -- a joint venture between National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Limited from India and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for developing the 100 megawatt solar power plant at Sampur -- has been signed, the Indian mission said in a statement.   Signing of this JVSHA demonstrates yet again India's ability to respond to Sri Lanka's priorities in a comprehensive and mutually beneficial manner,  it said.   Our cooperation with Sri Lanka in this domain will only become stronger with the implementation of the USD 100 million Line of Credit offered by India to Sri Lanka for development of solar power projects.   Similarly, there is significant interest among the private sector on both sides for cooperation in renewable energy which is likely to increase in the coming years,  the statement added.  A 2013 agreement with NTPC to build a thermal power plant in Sampur was later abandoned.  Sri Lanka is facing its all-time worst foreign exchange crisis after the pandemic hit the nation's earnings from tourism and remittances. By December, the reserves position had plummeted to just one month's imports or a little over USD 1 billion.  In recent months, the public has experienced a shortage of many essentials due to the foreign exchange crisis. Import restrictions to save dollars have threatened cooking gas and fuel supplies in addition to the looming power cuts.",

It is proposed to prescribe minimum 90% local value addition and 22% module performance for being eligible for PLI,  the official said.  In order to qualify for the bid, the applicant manufacturer will have to promise minimum integration across solar cells and modules.  In the initial version of the scheme with an outlay of Rs 4,500 crore, the government had received 18 eligible bids for 54.8 GW and had selected three bidders - Reliance New Energy, Shirdi Sai Electricals, and Jindal India Solar - for about 8.7 GW.At that time, the renewable energy ministry had said it could choose the remaining bidders if the PLI allocation goes up. 90109731Coal India, Adani Infrastructure, Larsen & Toubro, ReNew Solar, Tata Power, Acme Solar, and Vikram Solar were among the others in race.However, the official cited earlier told ET that it has now been decided to call fresh bids since the bid conditions have changed.In the first phase, the selection of bidders under the scheme was made based on three parameters - extent of integration, proposed manufacturing capacity, and the performance efficiency of the modules.There are four stages in module making - polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules. India's existing 15 GW production capacity has no polysilicon or wafer production capacity.The official said preference will be given to manufacturers who set up higher capacity plants. However, the applicant manufacturer will have to undertake to set up a manufacturing plant of minimum 1,000 MW capacity.The maximum capacity that can be awarded to a single bidder under PLI including the capacity awarded in the initial bid was 10 GW polysilicon to modules and 6 GW for wafers to modules.",

        "articleBody": "India installed a record 1,700 megawatt (MW) of rooftop solar capacity in 2021, registering a 136 per cent year-on-year rise, according to a Mercom India Research report. The country had added 719 MW of rooftop solar capacity in 2020, the research firm said in its latest report on Wednesday. India added a record 1.7 GW of rooftop solar capacity in 2021, the highest ever in a year. The installations were up 136 per cent compared to 719 MW in 2020, the Annual 2021 India Rooftop Solar Market Report said. In 2021, the residential and commercial segments accounted for 35 per cent and 33 per cent of installed rooftop solar capacity, respectively. Industrial rooftop solar installations constituted 26 per cent, and the remaining 6 per cent was from the government segment.  The rooftop solar market in India had its best year, largely due to the pent-up demand from 2020, which experienced a severe decline due to the COVID-19. Certainty around net metering regulation helped along with the demand from consumers across all segments - residential, commercial, and Industrial. An increase in component costs will dent demand in 2022, but we still expect positive growth this year,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. Gujarat was the leading state for cumulative rooftop solar installations with a 27 per cent share, followed by Maharashtra and Rajasthan, which added 14 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. The top 10 states accounted for approximately 85 per cent of cumulative rooftop solar installations in 2021. According to the report, the installations could have been higher if there were no price increases in components, commodities, and raw materials.  The increase in the rate of goods and services tax (GST) was also a big blow for installers. The average cost of a rooftop solar system increased by 14.75 per cent, compared to October-December 2020. Installers had to increase prices in 2021 to match the 12 per cent GST hike and combat materials cost increases.  However, in 2021, tenders of over 1 GW of rooftop solar capacity were issued, a 56 per cent jump year-on-year. Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) contributed to 27 per cent of the total issued tenders. Distribution companies in states like Maharashtra, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Karnataka accounted for 29 per cent. According to the report, distribution companies issued empanelment tenders in Kerala, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Haryana, West Bengal, Tripura, and Karnataka under Phase-II of MNRE's rooftop solar programme during 2021.",

SPIC Ltd worked with France-based floating solar power specialists and global leader  Ceil and Terre  to design, engineer and anchor the floating islands and the supply floats.EDAC Engineering Ltd., another company of the AM International Group, took up the construction activities.Chief Minister M K Stalin said the demand for clean power was the need of the hour, and Tamil Nadu currently holds the capacity to generate more than 15,500 MW of renewable energy. SPIC's floating solar power plant project is a welcome move towards industries in the state using renewable energy resources. Innovations like this are milestones towards achieving the goal of making Tamil Nadu a leader in renewable energy,  he said.SPIC Chairman Ashwin Muthiah said,  I thank Chief Minister M K Stalin for inaugurating the solar power plant project. SPIC is continuously working towards effectively harnessing green energies through innovative projects to reduce carbon footprint. On the arrival of the high-profile delegation, SPIC Whole-Time Director S R Ramakrishnan welcomed Stalin and did a walk through of the plant. We are glad to be at the forefront of India's and Tamil Nadu's march towards clean energy. It is an example of our ESG (environmental, social, and governance) commitment to progress towards renewable energy , Muthiah said.The total project cost was Rs 150.4 crore of which a significant portion was attributed to the pandemic during the construction phase, the company said. The state-of-the-art project marks a significant achievement in the space of solar-generated energy development. It further establishes our focus on using renewable energy to build a sustainable future , he said.The floating solar power plant would generate more energy as water facilitates a cooling effect leading to a higher yield. The project would also help the environment by curbing water evaporation in the reservoir by 60 per cent, the company said.",

        "articleBody": "The capital, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world, still has a long way to go to achieve its clean energy goals and increase its dependency on renewable sources to reduce emissions.Data showed that Delhi saw some increase in the installed capacity last year, but it was a fraction of the ambitious targets set by Delhi government\u2019s solar power policy. As of December 2021, the installed capacity through rooftop solar plants was 221.5 MW against the target of 1,000 MW by 2020 and 2,762 MW by 2022.\u201cSolar energy has a lot of potential in Delhi. The goal is to reduce the dependence on coal-fired electricity and, thus, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said a government report.According to clean energy consulting firm Mercom India, the cumulative rooftop solar power installations as of July 31, 2021 was 184 MW. The installations rose to 201 MW by September 2021. Delhi\u2019s discoms have a renewable power purchase obligation of 10.25% for 2021-22 and 10.5% for 2022-23.While Delhi government is promoting rooftop solar power to promote clean energy and reduce the carbon footprint, the endeavour seems to be lagging due to a slew of reasons.\u201cResidential rooftop solar power is not picking up pace, but booming in the commercial and industrial segment because of the cost implications. Since residential users in Delhi get 200 units free, people are not very interested in solar power. This is a major roadblock,\u201d said Binit Das, deputy programme manager, renewables, Centre for Science and Environment.Das added that higher power purchase agreements were also a roadblock as the city bought clean energy from elsewhere, thereby affecting local targets.\u201cThe existing purchase models are not fit for residential purposes in Delhi. Capital expenditure needs large investments. Another model, renewable energy service company, installs the entire setup on rooftops for free and charges for per unit of consumption. But it is done on a large scale (200 KW limit), while normal households are of 3-5KW,\u201d he said.Ashwani Ashok from Power for All, an NGO that works in the energy and renewables sector, said, \u201cSolar power is not doing well across the country, but there is a huge potential. The issues include rise in project cost after Covid-19, higher operational and maintenance cost and lack of funding. There is also dependence on non-indigenous panels. Also, the targets in all cities are ambitious.\u201dExperts, however, stated that while Delhi had issues like limited land resources, during the pandemic many group housing societies were reluctant to let vendors enter their areas.\u201cBSES Rajdhani and Yamuna have been aggressively promoting rooftop solar power in south, west, east and central Delhi. They have energised a record 4,000-plus installations with a connected load of over 120 MW. To realise its full potential, BSES is accelerating rooftop installations, besides adoption of solar power. This is a win-win proposition for both consumers and the discoms. The outreach programme is also educating consumers about the benefits of solar energy,\u201d said a discom official.",

India added a record 10 GW of solar in 2021, the highest ever in a year. Solar accounted for 62 per cent of new power capacity additions in 2021, the largest share of power capacity ever,  it said.During the year, large-scale solar projects accounted for 83 per cent of installations and saw a 230 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) surge. Rooftop installations registered a y-o-y increase of 138 per cent in 2021.Rajasthan, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh were the top three states for cumulative large-scale solar capacity accounting for 50 per cent of the installations in the country as of December 2021.In 2021, Rajasthan led the capacity addition with 4.5 GW of solar capacity installation, the report further said.The demand outlook for 2022 is strong, but significant challenges await the industry, beginning with the basic customs duty, import restrictions, and the goods and services tax on top of global supply chain issues, and high component prices, said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.According to the report, the average project cost was also higher in 2021 due to higher module, raw material prices and freight charges. In 2021, solar tenders dipped 4.3 per cent y-o-y and auctions fell 2.6 per cent compared to 2020. The delay in signing power-sale agreements (PSA) and lack of clarity regarding applicable duties were some of the reasons for the slowdown in tender and auction activity,  the report said. ",

They have not made any changes to the plot, and have been able to install 35% extra panels.While each MW of installation on a piece of flat land requires 3.75 acres, the Payyanur project has consumed just 2.75 acres, he added.With the commissioning of Payyanur plant, the combined installed capacity of CIAL\u2019s solar power plants will reach 50 MW, adding 2 lakh units of electricity a day. The Kochi airport's daily need, however, stands at 1.6 lakh units, much lower than its generation.",

        "articleBody": "The Quad leaders have renewed their commitment to promote a free, open, rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region, the White House said on Thursday, while emphasising that the US is funding USD 500 million to help American companies manufacture solar panels in India.  In November 2017, the US, Australia, India and Japan gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence, amidst China's growing military presence in the strategic region. A detailed report issued by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, on the first anniversary of the presidential executive order on America's Supply Chain, prominently notes the importance of Quad and other international partners in addressing the supply chain issue.  Australia, India, Japan, and the United States are committed to promoting the free, open, rules-based order, rooted in international law and undaunted by coercion, to bolster security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,  the White House report said. The report states that the US is funding USD 500 million to help American companies manufacture solar panels in India.  Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is actively pursuing investments overseas that will strengthen key US and international supply chains, such as the DFC's December 2021 announcement that it would provide up to USD 500 million in financing for a US company to expand solar manufacturing in India,  it said. This builds on domestic investments to expand solar manufacturing in the United States, the report stated.  This group is working together on building open and secure supply chains for vaccine production, establishing responsible and resilient clean-energy supply chains and launching a green shipping network, and focusing on critical and emerging technology - including a joint semiconductor supply chain mapping initiative,  it said. The Biden-Harris Administration has been working with the Congress, our international allies and partners, and the private sector to expand available supplies of the microelectronics, or semiconductor chips, that go into cars, smart phones, medical equipment, and our broadband and power infrastructure, it said. Securing the critical minerals that the United States will need to make a clean energy transition, build next-generation defense systems, and fuel our manufacturing economy will be the work of decades, it said. In a fact sheet, the White House said President Biden is committed to working with US trading partners to address the immediate supply chain challenges from this unprecedented economic recovery and building long-term supply chain resilience for the future.  Later this year, the Biden-Harris Administration will host a Ministerial-level Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience to address near-term bottlenecks and tackle long-term challenges, building on the Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience that President Biden held in October with the European Union and over a dozen like-minded countries,  it added.

        "articleBody": "ICRA Ratings on Monday said it expects the business prospects for domestic solar original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to remain strong aided by several policy measures over the medium-term.Many of the domestic OEMs have announced sizeable capital expenditure to augment the cell and module capacity, including the capex for integrated facilities under PLI scheme by the winning bidders, an official statement said. However, timely commissioning and ramp-up of on-going capex in module manufacturing value chain remains a critical in the near to medium term.As a result, adequacy of the modules from the domestic OEMs to meet the demand in utility and non-utility segment as well as quality of such modules remains a monitorable, the statement said.\u201cThe policy focus by the government of India (GoI) in the renewable energy (RE) sector remains strong as also evident from the policy target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by CY 2030 as well as policy direction in the energy transition with net zero emission target by 2070. In this context, capacity addition in solar energy segment within the RE is expected to remain significant with about 65-70% share by FY 2030, given the relatively lower execution challenges in solar segment,\u201d ICRA senior vice president and co-group head corporate rating Girish Kumar Kadam said .He said the GoI has a policy focus to encourage the domestic manufacturing for photovoltaic (PV) modules through various policy measures announced in last 2-3 year period such as notification of approved list of module manufacturers (ALMM) w.e.f. April 2021, imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported cells & modules w.e.f. April 2022, award of manufacturing linked PPAs for aggregate capacity of 12 GW, ongoing implementation of production linked incentive (PLI) scheme as well as that of various central schemes announced earlier, requiring use of domestic modules. \u201cFurther, ALMM list has only domestic solar OEMs and there remains an uncertainty for inclusion of foreign solar OEMs as of now,\u201d Kadam said.Given the strong response for the PLI scheme for solar modules, the scheme outlay has been further increased to Rs 24,000 crore from Rs 4500 earlier. This is expected to support the setting up of additional cell and module manufacturing capacity of up to 40 GW. The module manufacturing units set up under PLI scheme would be eligible for receiving PLI on annual basis on sales of solar PV modules for 5 years from commissioning or 5 years from scheduled commissioning date, whichever is earlier. PLI payable will also be computed based on the volume sales, the base PLI rate, the tapering factor and the extent of local value addition.The PV module price environment has however remained elevated over the last 10-12 month period, with the demand-supply imbalances in polysilicon as well as supply chain disruptions in China. Given that the import dependency for the OEMs is expected to continue for sourcing of key components, the pricing behaviour for polysilicon and cells in China thus remains a key monitorable, going forward.\u201cAs a result, OEMs based on imported cells remain exposed to volatility in cell /module price levels. Based on an imported module price level of 27 cents/watt for Mono PERC modules and cell price at 15 cents/watt, the cost of module from such domestic OEMs is expected to be lower by 10-11% post April 2022, assuming the applicable BCD on imported cells/modules. However, the extent of discount will reduce, if the prices of imported cells and modules reduce from the prevailing level. From the viability perspective in case of OEMs with integrated facilities, the scale of operations, pace of technology adoption with the emerging trends in key markets such as in China/Europe as well as module price movement remain the critical factors,\u201d ICRA vice president and sector head \u2013 corporate ratings Vikram V said.

        "articleBody": "The farmers of Pavagada scored their first victory in the early days of negotiations with Karnataka state energy officials, who were seeking to rent their land to set up a solar park: a legal agreement drafted in their local language, Kannada. For the drought-hit farmers of Pavagada, now home to one of India's largest solar power plants, a copy of the lease agreement translated from English gave them a better understanding of the deal that would shape their future. The Shakti Sthala Farmers' Welfare Association, named after the official title of the Pavagada plant, grew out of this small win and the early realisation that a bright future for local people living in the solar park's shadow was not guaranteed.  The government came to us because they knew we had suffered many droughts and our backs were broken,  said N Gurudatta, 50, who leased 20 acres (8 hectares) to the solar park.  We were wary and confused. There were different people with different views on what was good for us. That is when we started going for all meetings and discussions as a group. We found our strength in numbers,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Pavagada solar park is one of 52 such solar power facilities India had approved across 14 states as of last year, in a drive to wean itself off planet-heating coal and meet a renewable energy capacity goal of 500 gigawatts by 2030. Unlike most other places, in Pavagada, farmers continue to own the land used by the solar firms operating the park, making it a unique plug-and-play model, according to state officials. But it is also the rare involvement of residents around the massive facility that differentiates it and highlights the need for community participation as India bets big on solar power, say human rights activists.  This voluntary group of farmers came up because of the unfairness of the deal to begin with,  said Leo Saldanha, coordinator of the non-profit Environment Support Group that has done research on the impacts of solar parks in Karnataka.  With solar, it has become a race to the bottom in terms of regulatory relaxations as states vie with each other to attract investment. In the process, the people have been forgotten. To be heard, they will have to come together as one,  he said. RESIDENTS' REPRESENTATIONAround 2016, conversations about a solar energy policy in the corridors of government offices in Bengaluru, 180 km (112 miles) from Pavagada, reached the farmers' doorstep. Many were dazzled by the land offer, some resisted, and some tried to bargain for a higher price. In the end, Karnataka leased 13,000 acres from about 1,800 farmers across five villages to set up the Pavagada solar park, where 11 companies collectively generate 2,050 megawatts. As per the agreement, the land was leased out for 25 years at an annual rate of 21,000 Indian rupees ($279) per acre.  In the beginning, there was no co-ordination between the farmers and each one was trying to make sense of the proposal individually,  said Paramesha Naik, an environmental science professor at Bangalore University. Naik also advises the farmers' association and was brought in as a member although he has not leased land to the park.  Many progressive farmers saw the need to come together and wanted me on board as I have been researching on renewable energy,  he said.  Concerns of damage to the land, water and environment have always been at the back of people's minds.  Registered in 2018, the association - which currently has more than 500 members - has a clear mandate: to safeguard the interests of local communities and guarantee promises are kept. In December, it held an emergency meeting after one of the solar companies mortgaged farmers' land lease documents to obtain a bank loan.  If we hadn't been vigilant, this would have gone unnoticed,  said R N Akkalappa, acting president of the group. Akkalappa was one of the few who gave up his land for a fixed annual rent while also managing to get a job in the park as he had experience working with bore-well motors. The group meets often to discuss members' problems, he said, adding they had ensured security guards hired by solar companies were paid pension benefits and worked only eight-hour shifts. Initially, there were no representatives of villagers who had leased their land at discussions about the park organised by district administration and energy officials, he added.  After the association was formed, things have changed a little. Now we are invited to some meetings and we get a chance to talk about our concerns,  he added. 'SOLAR FUNDS'The barbed wire, fences and walls that separate the solar park from the villagers that leased their land have also forced changes in their daily lives, researchers say. Saldanha said pretty much each individual in every family had been affected  in some way .  Now a tractor has to travel a longer distance to reach a farm because the solar park is fenced. It means girls can't take a short cut to school. The festivities, (the) neighbourhood banter is lost,  he said.  All that remains is houses between solar panels.  Association members have flagged the challenges they face in numerous representations to district authorities. In letters penned last year, the group demanded an uninterrupted power supply to villages adjoining the solar park, improved drainage, a drinking water supply and better facilities at the local school.  The roads inside the solar park and leading to it are all nice and broad, but the roads inside our villages are terrible,  said Malla Reddy, a lawyer whose family gave 93 acres for the park, noting village roads were still in disrepair after being damaged by trucks carrying heavy loads during construction. A key demand of the farmers' group has been their inclusion in a high-level committee set up to develop the villages near the park. Under corporate social responsibility obligations, the solar firms must contribute to a fund established for that purpose. The association has repeatedly flagged delays in approval and misuse of the money, commonly referred to as  solar funds  by villagers. Tumkur deputy commissioner, Y S Patil, who is on the committee and oversees work sanctioned by the funds, said so far 635 million rupees ($8 million) had been earmarked for the five villages.  The focus is on basic infrastructure like water supply, drains and also on improving education facilities,  Patil said, adding that most of the work was ongoing. The association has also been promised a bigger role in decision-making about how the cash will be spent in future.  All our members have been told to keep a close eye on the quality and quantity of work that just began a few weeks back,  Naik said.  If it is not what was promised to us, we are ready to agitate, lobby, hold talks,  he added.  Our efforts to get a higher rent for the land also continues. Everyone's future has to be secure. ",

        "articleBody": "State-run SJVN Ltd is looking to develop 10,000 MW solar power projects entailing investment of Rs 50,000 crore in the next five years in Rajasthan.  SJVN has submitted its intention to develop 10,000 MW solar power projects in next five years in Rajasthan,  a company statement said.  According to the statement, the Government of Rajasthan has accepted the proposal of SJVN and an MoU in this regard will be signed shortly.  Letter of Intention (LOI) by SJVN and further Acceptance Letter were exchanged in the august presence of Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, by SJVN Chairman & Managing Director Nand Lal Sharma and Additional Chief Secretary, Power, Government of Rajasthan & CMD RRECL Subodh Agarwal in Jaipur on Tuesday, it stated.  Sharma informed that SJVN intents to establish 10,000 MW renewable power projects/parks on the land banks to be allocated by Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd in the state.  An estimated investment of Rs 50,000 crore is proposed by SJVN on developing these projects, it stated.  The commercial production will commence in a phased manner and the power generated will be transmitted to the beneficiaries through nearest sub-stations.  Power purchase agreements for the generated energy will be signed through competitive tariff-based opportunities available in the market.  He further added that these projects will usher in socio-economic development in the project areas and also open up avenues of direct and indirect employment to about 15,000 people.  Sharma said that driven by the commitment of Government of India to achieve 500 GW of installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, SJVN has re-engineered its business model and has given a major thrust to its renewable energy portfolio in a big way.   SJVN has proposed to develop solar power projects in Rajasthan as the state has largest solar power potential in the country. It receives the highest solar radiation (5.72 Kwh/m2/day) and also has the highest number of more than 325 clear sunny days in a year. All these factors work in our favour of developing the projects,  he said.  Sharma said that SJVN has 2,750 MW of renewable energy projects in its portfolio. He added that the company has recently upgraded its shared vision to installed capacity of 25,000 MW by 2030 and 50,000 MW by 2040.  The revision of targets is a result of SJVN being awarded mega power projects in India and abroad.",

        "articleBody": "Tata Power is in advanced talks with investors, including Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) as well as Singaporean sovereign fund Temasek Holdings and private equity firm General Atlantic to raise as much as $600-700 million (Rs 4478 crore - 5225 crore) for the renewable energy business at an equity valuation of around $6-7 billion.The deal is at an advanced stage and is likely to be concluded in the coming weeks, as the salt-to-steel conglomerate looks to pare debt and strengthen its balance sheet ahead of a planned public issue of the alternate energy unit.Tata Power's attempt to rope in investors, including CPPIB, was reported by ET in its edition dated 15 October 2021. However the likely valuation or the possible interest of Temasek and General Atlantic has not previously been reported. Sovereign money managers of the Middle East were also being tapped for a potential transaction. The asset monetization of renewable energy will help the company meet long term targets.Last year, Tata Power decided to club its entire renewables portfolio under an umbrella entity. This includes operating power assets in the pipeline, charging stations, rooftop solar, microgrids, panel manufacturing, engineering, procurement and construction.The company also had plans to go for an InVit. It had held negotiations with Malaysia\u2019s Petronas for a potential investment of up to $2 billion, but the talks couldn\u2019t culminate into a transaction.Emails sent to Tata Power, General Atlantic, and Temasek Holdings did not elicit any response till press time.Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) declined to comment.Tata Power has one of India's largest renewable energy businesses with an operating capacity of 2.6 GW comprising wind and solar in a 32:68 ratio spread across 11 states, according to rating agency ICRA.Tata Power has set targets to set up renewable capacity of 15 and 25 GW by FY25 and FY30, respectively.         89394634It aims to set up one lakh EV charging stations, with an eye on more than doubling the revenue the solar EPC revenue business to Rs 10,000 crore by the end of FY 25, from Rs 4100 crore at the end of FY-21 and increase the solar pump --used by farmers for irrigation-- revenue to Rs 5000 crore in the next four fiscal years.The proposed monetization is likely to bring in its ambit all green businesses which includes renewable, solar EPC, solar pumps, rooftop solar and EV charging.Tata Power Renewable had a total generation capacity of 2953 MW at the end of September 2021, compared with 2667 MW a year before in the same period, with a revenue of Rs 710 crore and profit of Rs 156 crore, according to Tata Power's quarterly presentation released after the second-quarter earnings.The renewable business had gross debt of Rs 11,274 crore at the end of September 2021. At the current capacity, Tata Power Renewable Energy is one of the top three players in the renewable energy space.Morgan Stanley expects Tata Power\u2019s renewable business EBITDA to grow at 12% CAGR between FY21 and FY25 led by capacity addition, 1.6 GW under construction and normalization of PLF for its wind assets compared with FY21 levels , while earnings to grow at a CAGR of 30%.The foreign equity broking firm believes that it sees asset monetization of its green portfolio (RE, solar EPC, solar pumps, rooftop solar and EV charging) over the next 6-12months, which would help the company with equity capital to fulfil its longer-term aspirations. Valuations ascribed during such asset monetization would be a key catalyst in the near term,it said.Tata Power Renewable Energy had an operating capacity of 2261 MW, consisting of 1710 MW of solar plants and 551 MW of wind plants, according to the company's annual report of FY21 which had increased 2953 MW by September 30,2021.Among the operating assets, the company has the largest capacity in Karnataka with 517 MW, followed by 400 MW in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh with 306 MW and the balance in other states. In FY21, the company had revenue of Rs 2211 crore compared with Rs 2176 crore a year before, with a profit of Rs 286 crore.",

        "articleBody": "Union Power Minister RK Singh on Tuesday said production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for solar cells and modules will aid the creation of 40-45 GW of additional solar equipment manufacturing capacity in the country. It is proposed in the General Budget presented in Lok Sabha on Tuesday that the funding under the PLI scheme for domestic solar cells and module manufacturing will be increased to Rs 24,000 crore from the existing Rs 4,500 crore.  This is a big scheme and aid to create production capacity of 40GW to 45GW of solar equipment here (in India), which ranges from polysilicon to modules,  Singh told reporters here. In her budget speech Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated that for facilitating domestic manufacturing for the ambitious goal of 280 GW of installed solar capacity by 2030, an additional allocation of Rs 19,500 crore for PLI scheme for manufacturing of high efficiency (solar) modules with a priority of fully integrate manufacturing units for polysilicon to solar PV modules will be made.In April 2021, the Union Cabinet approved a Rs 4,500 crore production linked incentive (PLI) scheme to boost the domestic manufacturing capacity of solar PV modules. When the scheme was approved in April 2021, it was aimed at adding a 10,000 MW manufacturing capacity of integrated solar PV modules, entailing a direct investment of Rs 17,200 crore at present. About raising import duty on solar modules from 20 per cent to 40 per cent, Singh stated,  We will use make in India solar modules and therefore 40 per cent customs duty will be imposed from April 1, 2022 . The Budget document has also proposed to hike import duty on solar cells to 25 per cent from 20 per cent from April 1, 2022. The minister also said,  (The) government has also provided for green bonds for investment in clean energy projects like green hydrogen . Sitharaman also proposed that as a part of the government's overall market borrowings in 2022-23, sovereign Green Bonds will be issued for mobilising resources for green infrastructure. The proceeds will be deployed in public sector projects, which help in reducing the carbon intensity of the economy. She also talked about co-firing five to seven per cent biomass pellets in thermal power plants, resulting in CO2 savings of 38 MMT (million metric tonnes) annually. Singh said that the government will also bring out a battery swapping policy and make green mobility zones. He explained that there could be such zones in overcrowded areas like Connaught Place or Sarojini Nagar. The minister also lauded the provision of blending of biomass pellets with fuel in thermal power plants. Whatever was required for energy transition, has been provided in this Budget (presented on Tuesday), the minister said.",

        "articleBody": "The Budget proposal to allocate Rs 24,000 crore under the PLI scheme to the solar industry for manufacturing solar cells and modules can lead to setting up of 30-35 gigawatts (GW) of the solar module capacity and 25-30 GW of the cell capacity by 2024, industry experts have said.While presenting the Union Budget 2022-23, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed to enhance the funding under the production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme for solar cell and module manufacturing to Rs 24,000 crore, from Rs 4,500 crore earlier. To facilitate domestic manufacturing to meet the ambitious goal of 280 GW of the installed solar capacity by 2030, an additional allocation of Rs 19,500 crore for the PLI scheme to manufacture high-efficiency solar modules with a priority of fully integrate manufacturing units for polysilicon to solar PV (photovoltaic) modules will be made,  she said in her Budget Speech.CRISIL Director Hetal Gandhi said a higher Rs 24,000-crore PLI allocation towards high-efficiency photovoltaic modules can lead to the setting up of 30-35 GW of solar module capacity and 25-30 GW of cell capacity by 2024.This will reduce dependence on imports, which stand at 90 per cent for cells and 75-80 per cent for modules currently, thereby making us not only self-reliant for annual module needs but also opening up huge export opportunities.But, Gandhi noted that it needs to be seen if the current bids made for PLI funding will be accepted as it is or companies under each category will be asked to match the lowest bidder.Similarly, ReNew Power Chairman and CEO Sumant Sinha termed the Budget as  climate-friendly  as it has laid the groundwork for the nation's ambition to be a net-zero country by 2070.It is great to see that the government has firmly put energy transition and clean energy at the heart of our economic growth and looks to address some of the most challenging aspects of this transition, he said.He added that the additional outlay of Rs 19,500 crore will help the renewable industry expand rapidly. Similarly, revocation of anti-dumping duty on steel will reduce the cost of modules considerably and ties in well with incentives for local manufacturing that now begin manufacturing by March 2024.Further, he said the inclusion of the grid storage and dense charging into the harmonised list of infrastructure will help mobility start-ups and independent power producers explore low-cost financing.He also welcomed the sovereign green bonds issuance plan, saying this can help mobilise financial resources for distribution companies as well as for clean energy investors.Essar Power CEO Kush S said the Budget has provided an impetus for growing clean energy as two of the four pillars of development include energy transition and climate action, and it shows the government's commitment towards a greener future.The additional allocation of Rs 19,500 crore for solar module manufacturing and conversion of coal into chemicals are bold steps in anticipation of the shift in the energy sector with a strong focus on ESG (environmental, social and governance) and renewable, he said.Similarly, the plans to have a battery-swapping policy for EV charging stations and to issue sovereign green bonds for funding green infrastructure will provide a big boost to the economy by reducing carbon intensity and will lead to positive environmental and climate effects.In April last year, the Cabinet had approved a Rs 4,500-crore PLI scheme to boost manufacturing capacity of solar PV modules with a view to add 10,000-megawatt (MW) manufacturing capacity of integrated solar PV modules entailing a direct investment of Rs 17,200 crore so as to reduce import dependence in a strategic sector like electricity.Under the scheme, solar PV manufacturers will be selected through a competitive bidding process and the money will be disbursed for five years after the commissioning of the plants.

        "articleBody": "The White House is considering extending Trump-era tariffs on solar power imports, but with a handful of tweaks to make it easier for domestic installers to access supplies, according to two sources familiar with the administration's thinking. The plan represents an attempt by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to find common ground between two important political constituencies: union labor, which supports import restrictions to protect domestic jobs, and clean energy developers keen to access overseas supplies that are cheaper than U.S.-made goods. Former President Donald Trump had imposed a four-year tariff regime on solar imports in 2018, starting at 30% and declining to 15% in the final year, in a bid to create U.S. solar manufacturing jobs. They had been set to expire on Feb. 6, but several domestic solar manufacturers last year sought the extension arguing their products were still unable to compete with overseas-made goods, mainly from China, that dominate the U.S. market. The White House is now considering extending the tariffs on solar panels and cells. But its plan would double the amount of cells that can be imported before the levies kick in to 5 gigawatts per year from 2.5, the sources said. The United States typically imports far less than 5 GW per year of cells. The plan would also exclude, bifacial solar panels, which can generate electricity on both sides and are used in utility-scale projects, the sources said. The Trump administration in 2019 had sought to temper its solar levies by excluding bifacial panels but then reversed course a year later to include them again. That triggered litigation by the solar manufacturing industry that resulted in their exclusion again in November of last year. The White House declined to comment. An administration official who asked not to be named told Reuters that no decision had been made yet, but that trade protections were likely.  The Administration is clear that regardless of the 201 decision, it will maintain strong trade remedies on solar and other products imported from China,  the source said.",

In comparison to 12,400 new workers employed in the sector in FY19, only 5,200 new workers were employed in FY20 and 6400 were employed in FY21, it said.In FY21, a majority of the new workers were employed in the rooftop solar segment where annual capacity additions grew by nine per cent over FY20 and accounted for 1.4 GW capacity, it added.The study further noted that India has successfully trained 78,000 people under the Suryamitra training program, between 2015 and 2017, to improve the availability of skilled workers for clean energy projects. The upcoming Union Budget must especially focus on scaling up rooftop solar, mini and micro grid systems, and domestic solar manufacturing to maximise the employment opportunities in the sector,  Dr Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW said.",

        "articleBody": "Local manufacturing of solar modules is set to soar by almost 400 per cent by fiscal 2025 compared to the last financial year with 30-35 GW of fresh module capacity at an investment of Rs 50,000 crore across the value chain, says a report. Rating agency Crisil's report is based on an analysis of the capex plans of the top 11 domestic module manufacturers that account for 80 per cent of the current solar module installed effective capacity.  The solar module manufacturing value chain starts with poly silicon and/or ingots, which are converted into wafers. These wafers are used to produce solar cells, which are then assembled to manufacture solar modules.  As of March 2021, the country had 3 GW of solar cell capacity, mostly used for captive production of solar modules, and 8 GW of effective solar module capacity. However, there is no local manufacturing of poly silicon and wafers yet.  Even this 8 GW capacity remains under utilised at 20 per cent because of higher cost of domestic modules compared with Chinese ones, which are 15-25 per cent (4-61 cents/watt) cheaper because of subsidies and scale efficiencies. As a result, nearly 80 per cent of our current annual solar module demand is catered to by Chinese module manufactures, it said in a report this week.  With the government now supporting domestic manufacturing through policy measures, their competitiveness relative to the Chinese is expected to improve, it added.  According to the report, the 40 percent custom duty on imported modules and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme will not only eliminate existing price gap but may even make domestic module competitive by 2-3 cents/watt at current prices.  The country's solar capacity implementation is expected to rise to 14 GW per annum between fiscals 2022 and 2024, and further, given aggressive renewable energy plans. This will drive demand for cells and modules.  In addition to price competitiveness, developers may also prefer domestic modules because they get better control of the supply chain over imports apart from also helping developers offset risks from surging freight cost seen in the recent past.  The report has estimated Rs 50,000 crore of investments across the value chain for capacity building through fiscal 2025. Module and cell manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase by 30-35 GW each, and the PLI scheme may help backward-integration into poly silicon and wafer capacities, it added.  While a 1 GW module line costs Rs 250 crore, a 1 GW cell line that requires high technological know how and higher value addition costs Rs 600 crore. Further, backward integration to poly silicon and wafer may cost Rs 2,500 crore per GW.",

The assets, totalling 140 MW, are spread over 100 pan-India projects, set up at facilities where the renewable energy produced is consumed there itself. Most of these projects are operational.A formal announcement is likely to be made next week. The deal marks ReNew's exit from the segment as it enters other areas like energy storage, green hydrogen and large-scale corporate deployments, the people said.Responding to ET's email, ReNew Power said:  We don't have any comment to offer on this.  The people who spoke to ET called this as the spinning off of non-core assets by ReNew Power to focus more on corporate power purchase arrangements and larger deployments for energy transition.As of December 2021, ReNew had a total capacity of about 10.3 GW of renewable energy projects, including commissioned and committed projects.

Corporate funding in 2021 was the highest in ten years.Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said 2021 was the best year for solar corporate funding and mergers and acquisitions since 2010. Financing activity bounced back strongly, following a COVID-19-affected 2020.There was more money than ever chasing deals, and more demand than supply of attractive companies and assets as organisations and funds look to fulfil their ESG and clean energy mandates, he added.The global venture capital and private equity funding in the solar sector in 2021 came to USD 4.5 billion, registering a rise of 281 per cent from USD 1.2 billion garnered in 2020. There were 11 VC funding deals of over USD 100 million apiece in 2021.In India, Oorja Development Solutions, an off-grid solar services provider, secured USD 1 million in seed funding from Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia (SEEAA).In 2021, the public market financing segment raised USD 7.5 billion, which was 49 per cent higher compared to USD 5.1 billion in 2020.Debt financing came to USD 15.8 billion, a 91 per cent increase compared to USD 8.3 billion raised during 2020. In India, in the debt funding segment, Virescent Renewable Energy Trust (VRET) raised USD 288.4 million through listed non-convertible debentures and long-term debt financing. Merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the solar sector soared with 126 transactions in 2021 - the highest number of deals ever recorded.\u201cMost of the transactions involved solar downstream companies. The largest transaction in 2021 was Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL), which acquired a 100 per cent stake in SB Energy India at an enterprise valuation of approximately USD 3.5 billion,  the report said.In the domestic M&A segment, Reliance New Energy Solar, the green energy arm of Reliance Industries, signed an agreement with Shapoorji Pallonji and Company to acquire a 40 per cent stake in Sterling and Wilson Solar, a solar engineering, procurement, and construction company, through a combination of primary investment, a secondary purchase, and an open offer.Reliance New Energy Solar also acquired REC Solar Holdings from China National Bluestar Group for USD 771 million.Sharing details of the project M&A deals, it said, France-based solar developer Technique Solaire acquired a 34 MW ground-mounted solar project in Uttar Pradesh from the Jakson Group and businessman Ravi Goyal. Another company, Ayana Renewable Power, signed a deal to acquire a 100 per cent equity stake in a 250 MW solar PV project developed and operated by ACME Solar Holdings.Virescent Renewable Energy Trust acquired a 49 MW solar portfolio from five special purpose vehicles (SPVs) of Focal Energy for USD 46.7 million.",

        "articleBody": "Tesla Inc shareholders urged a judge on Tuesday to find Elon Musk coerced the company's board into a 2016 deal for SolarCity and asked that the chief executive be ordered to pay the electric vehicle company one of the largest judgments ever of $13 billion. This case has always been about whether the acquisition of SolarCity was a rescue from financial distress, a bailout, orchestrated by Elon Musk,  said Randy Baron, an attorney for shareholders, at the start of his closing arguments.The closing arguments recounted key findings from a 10-day trial in July when Musk spent two days on the stand defending the deal.The lawsuit by union pension funds and asset managers alleges that Musk strong-armed the Tesla board into approving the deal for the cash-strapped SolarCity, in which Musk was the top shareholder.Musk has countered that the deal was part of a decade-old master plan to create a vertically integrated company that would transform energy generation and consumption with SolarCity's roof panels and Tesla's cars and batteries.Evan Chesler, one of the lawyers representing Musk, told the hearing that the deal was not a bailout and SolarCity was far from insolvent and its finances resembled many high-growth tech companies. They were building billions of dollars of long-term value,  Chesler said of SolarCity.The all-stock deal was valued at $2.6 billion in 2016, but since that time Telsa's stock has soared.Shareholder attorney Lee Rudy urged Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware's Court of Chancery to order Musk return the Tesla stock he received, which would be worth around $13 billion at its current price.Musk said in court papers such an award would be at least five times the largest award ever in a comparable shareholder lawsuit and called it a  windfall  for plaintiffs.Rudy said Slights should consider Musk's contempt for the deposition and trial process, in which he repeatedly clashed with and insulted shareholder attorneys.  It would be a windfall for Elon Musk if he got to keep shares he never should have gotten in the first place,  Rudy said.Chesler called the request to order Musk to return the stock from the deal  preposterous  and said it ignored five years of unprecedented success at Tesla.Tesla's stock was flat at around $1,049.Telsa acquired SolarCity as the electric vehicle maker was approaching the launch of its Model 3, a mass-market sedan that was critical to its strategy. Shareholders allege the deal was a needless distraction and burdened Tesla with SolarCity's financial woes and debt.Shareholders claim that despite owning only 22% of Tesla, Musk was a controlling shareholder due to his ties to board members and domineering style.

        "articleBody": "Artha Energy Resources on Wednesday announced the launch of RenewShare, a renewable energy investment platform, that enables fractional ownership of renewable energy (RE) assets in the country.Launched as an autonomous investment platform, RenewShare caters to investors interested in diversifying their existing portfolio while being a part of the fast-growing RE landscape in India, the renewable energy solutions provider said in a statement. While RE has an impressive growth story, access to viable investment opportunities in the sector for most investors is virtually non-existent. The RE segment carries the tag of being an extremely expensive asset class to own and manage independently. We, as an aggregator, aim to resolve this problem by facilitating to bring down the ticket size for investments,  Animesh Damani, Founder and CEO, RenewShare, said.The platform, during its launch, has already enlisted a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with assets worth Rs 7 crore and an early investment commitment of Rs 10 crore from investors, with RE assets spread across four cities, the statement said. With the initial total investment commitment of Rs 10 crore, the response from the investor circle has been overwhelming, which solidifies our belief in the huge potential and interest in the RE sector. Hence, we will facilitate over Rs 200 crores worth of transactions per annum by FY 2024 and are confident to help investors capture 10 per cent of Indian operating expenses (OPEX) projects,  he added.The platform enlists thematic SPVs, wherein similar renewable energy projects in the wind and solar segment are combined after being thoroughly vetted by a team of experts. Investors have the choice and can pick a pool of SPVs with their preferred RE projects based on their risk appetite, it stated.SPVs listed on RenewShare would initially require an investment of Rs 20 lakh from an investor, it stated.As a viable alternative to fixed income, the assets listed on the SPVs are filtered in a way to generate a 2x rate of return than the current prevailing long-term FD rates offered by leading Indian Banks. The platform would later be made available to retail investors, it stated.The impact investment platform will facilitate multiple investors to co-invest within a large pool of projects but with lower counter-party risk. The investments made in an SPV is split across multiple RE assets, thus lowering the risk considerably.",

ANIL and Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries are set to change the Indian RE sector.All about ANILShort for Adani New Industries Ltd, the new subsidiary of Adani Enterprises will undertake the business of developing and operating projects for the synthesis of low carbon fuels and chemicals, generation of low carbon electricity and the manufacture of key components/material for projects including generation of green hydrogen, related downstream products, electricity generation, manufacture of wind turbines.ANIL will also manufacture solar modules, batteries, electrolyzers, associated upstream manufacturing as well as ancillary industries and undertake all such activities associated therewith in this regard, the company added in a filing.Adani Group already is the world's largest solar power developer. Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL) is targeting 45 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and will invest USD 20 billion to develop a 2 GW per year solar manufacturing capacity by 2022-23.Meanwhile, Adani Transmission Ltd (ATL), India's largest private sector power transmission and retail distribution company, is looking to increase the share of renewable power procurement from the current 3 per cent to 30 per cent by FY 2023 and to 70 per cent by FY 2030.What Mukesh Ambani is doingBillionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd has floated Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd (RNESL) to operate its new energy business.RNESL has made a wave of acquisitions and strategic investments to give shape to its green energy business that spans solar, battery and hydrogen investments. The direction largely has been towards acquiring or gaining access to cutting-edge technology that can reduce the cost of renewable energy production, especially in solar energy generation.It has put USD 1.2 billion in partnerships with REC, NexWafe, Sterling and Wilson, Stiesal and Ambri to acquire the expertise and technology portfolio to start to build a fully integrated end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem through solar, batteries and hydrogen. It has recently invested in the British battery maker Faradion Ltd for an enterprise value of GBP 100 million. Based out of Sheffield and Oxford in the UK and with its patented sodium-ion battery technology, Faradion is one of the leading global battery technology companies.Reliance is targeting solar manufacturing of 100 GW and green hydrogen costs of USD 1 per kg by 2030. It plans to spend USD 10 billion on the new energy business over the next 3 years towards achieving these targets.Previously, Reliance announced the acquisition of REC Solar Holdings from China National Bluestar for USD 771 million.Ambani's firm is investing USD 45 million in NexWafe to jointly develop and commercialise at scale monocrystalline green solar wafers and is acquiring 40 per cent in leading solar EPC and O&M provider Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited (SWSL).It has also signed a pact with Norway's Stiesdal for technology development, and manufacturing of Stiesdal's HydroGen Electrolyzers in India.Another USD 50 million has been invested in US-based Ambri to develop and commercialise Ambri's liquid metal batteries for energy storage.Reliance is also in discussion with Ambri to set up a large-scale battery manufacturing facility in India.Ambani at the company's shareholders' meeting in June announced its plan to invest USD 10 billion in low carbon energy, which marks another chapter in the transformation of the company.Over the next 3 years, Reliance will spend Rs 60,000 crore to construct four 'Giga factories' to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolysers, fuel cells and batteries to store energy from the grid.The site of these plants will be located at the new 5,000 acres Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar. An additional Rs 15,000 crore will be used for investments across the value chain, technology, and partnerships for the new energy business.(With inputs from agencies)",

        "articleBody": "Oil and gas major Royal Dutch Shell has emerged as a surprise bidder to acquire Sprng Energy, the Indian renewable platform of Actis Llp that is on sale, said people aware of the matter.Shell, the world\u2019s largest trader of liquefied natural gas, will be competing with Australian infrastructure fund Macquarie and Canadian pension fund CPP Investment Board (CPPIB) for the potential billion dollar plus buyout. All three were shortlisted last week, after an initial round of screening from a list of close to 20 potential candidates that had signed non-disclosure agreements. Shell\u2019s $1.2 billion non-binding equity offer is believed to have trumped all others. The debt on these assets is $960 million.The shortlisted parties are due to submit binding offers in six-eight weeks.Emerging market private equity firm Actis has mandated Bank of America to officially launch the sale process for Sprng Energy, ET first reported in September. This is the second platform that Actis had created after it sold Ostro Energy, its original green power platform, to ReNew Power Ventures in 2018 at an enterprise value of $1.5 billion.         88799515Sprng Energy has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 2.6 gigawatts (GW), of which 2.1 GW will be operational by March 2022, while another 600 MW is expected to be operational by March 2023. The FY22 ebitda for all the contracted assets is pegged at $220 million. The platform was set up by Actis Fund IV with an equity commitment of $475 million in March 2017. Sprng Energy expanded its portfolio by buying out assets with a capacity of 600 MW from Acme Cleantech last year and the 194 MW solar energy portfolio of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group in 2019.A Macquarie spokesperson declined to comment. Actis, CPPIB, and Shell didn\u2019t respond to queries. It is a good portfolio with PPAs with good counterparties like SECI, NTPC, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL),  said the CEO of a competing green platform who evaluated the asset, on condition of anonymity.  But the valuation of the pipeline has been a challenge for many. Domestic players are aware of the headwinds. For example, in Andhra Pradesh they have invested around $150 million in a 250 MW project (and) issues with the state government are not yet fully resolved. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy had cancelled several contracted projects in the state alleging corruption and high tariffs in 2019. The matter is still caught up in legal battles. According to an ICRA report from last year, Sprng Energy will continue to benefit from its demonstrated operating track record as well as the presence of long-term PPAs at cost-competitive tariffs with strong counterparties for a major portion of the company\u2019s portfolio on a consolidated basis.Oil and gas super majors including Shell have been under pressure from heightened investor activists pushing for change, voting in higher numbers than ever before for climate-related resolutions. Third Point, a US hedge fund calling for Shell\u2019s break-up, said in October that the Anglo-Dutch supermajor had  too many competing stakeholders,  resulting in  an incoherent, conflicting set of strategies attempting to appease multiple interests but satisfying none .Since February 2021, Shell has detailed its strategy to achieve its target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. In October 2021, Shell set a target to reduce absolute emissions by 50% by 2030, from 2016 levels, which includes all Scope 1 and 2 emissions.Last December, it acquired US-based solar and energy storage developer Savion from Macquarie's Green Investment Group, to expand its global solar portfolio as part of the push to move to net-zero emissions. With the acquisition, Shell said it aimed to sell more than 560 terawatt hours globally per year by 2030 as part of its integrated power business \u2014 twice as much electricity as the company sells currently \u2014 and expected to serve more than 15 million retail and business customers worldwide as a leading provider of clean power-as-a-service.However, Shell does not have any major presence in the Indian clean energy space and only holds about 49% of solar power producer Cleantech Solar Energy. Shell's arm Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd had acquired a 49% stake in Cleantech Solar in 2019. Sources said it was also contemplating a joint bid for BPCL but the plans did not proceed further. The interest from global investors in India\u2019s green energy space has been high in the past few years, despite a slowdown in renewable energy (RE) capacity addition in FY21. The total value of acquisitions in India\u2019s renewable energy sector surged by more than 300% to $6 billion in the first 10 months of 2021 from less than $1.5 billion reported in 2020, according to a study by the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) and the International Energy Agency (IEA).Macquarie currently operates about 414 MW of solar assets in India, about 375 MW of which was acquired from Hindustan Power projects and the rest from Canadian Solar. In 2020, Blueleaf Energy, a portfolio company of Macquarie\u2019s Green Investment Group, acquired a majority stake in Hyderabad-based Vibrant Energy with a pipeline of over 400 MW solar plants across India.CPPIB has been among the biggest foreign institutional backers of Indian cleantech initiatives, including ReNew Power. It was also one of the prospective buyers for Mahindra Susten's 617 MW assets and a key contender for SoftBank\u2019s majority stake in SB Energy Holdings but was pipped by the Adani Group.In May 2019, CPPIB joined hands with Piramal Enterprises to set up India\u2019s first renewable energy focused infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) by raising $600 million, with the Canadians agreeing to contribute $360 million. Globally, CPP Investments' exposure to renewable energy went up to $6 billion as of March 31, 2021, from $5.2 billion a year ago.",

        "articleBody": "Billionaire Gautam Adani's logistics-to-energy conglomerate has set up a new subsidiary, ANIL to undertake green hydrogen projects, generation of low carbon electricity and manufacture of wind turbines, solar modules and batteries as it looks to become the world's largest renewable energy company and produce the cheapest hydrogen. Adani had in November last year stated that his group will invest USD 70 billion in the new energy space of the next decade.  And now the company has incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), its flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd said in a regulatory filing.  ANIL will undertake business of developing and operating projects for the synthesis of low carbon fuels and chemicals, generation of low carbon electricity and the manufacture of key components/material for projects including generation of green hydrogen, related downstream products, electricity generation, manufacture of wind turbines, it said.  ANIL will also manufacture solar modules, batteries, electrolyzers, associated upstream manufacturing as well as ancillary industries and undertake all such activities associated therewith in this regard, it added.  Group companies have already charted out ambitious plans. Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), the world's largest solar power developer, is targeting 45 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and will invest USD 20 billion to develop a 2 GW per year solar manufacturing capacity by 2022-23.  Adani Transmission Ltd (ATL), India's largest private sector power transmission and retail distribution company, is looking to increase the share of renewable power procurement from the current 3 per cent to 30 per cent by FY 2023 and to 70 per cent by FY 2030.  Speaking at an event on November 11, 2021, Adani Group's founder-chairman said the group is working to make renewable a viable, affordable alternative to fossil fuels.   By 2030, we expect to be the world's largest renewable energy company without any caveat - and we have committed USD 70 billion over the next decade to make this happen. There is no other company that has yet made such a large bet on developing its sustainability infrastructure,  Adani had said.  Adani Group already is the world's largest solar power developer.   We, therefore, believe the combination of our renewable capacity and the size of our investment makes us the leader among all global companies in the effort to produce cheap green electricity and green hydrogen,  he said without giving details of the plans to produce hydrogen.  Adani Enterprises in the regulatory filing said,  ANIL will commence its business operations in due course.   At COP 26 in Glasgow, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced 2070 as India's target year to reach net-zero carbon emissions.  India also announced a slew of other, more ambitious, climate targets for 2030: increasing the share of renewables in the country's energy mix to 50 per cent; expanding installed capacity of non-fossil energy from 450 to 500 GW; and reducing the carbon intensity of the economy by 45 per cent, as opposed to the previous goal of 33-35 per cent.  And towards that Adani as well as the richest Indian, Mukesh Ambani have announced ambitious plans.  On June 24, 2021, addressing Reliance Industries shareholders, Ambani said his oil-to-telecom conglomerate will invest Rs 60,000 crore to set up four giga factories, which  will manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the new energy ecosystem .  Subsequent to that, his company has made a slew of acquisitions to get the technology and capability to generate green hydrogen, manufacture solar modules and make batteries.",

        "articleBody": "Amp Energy India on Tuesday said it has commissioned a 30 MW solar power project for Bosch Ltd. The solar project capacity would be provided from Amp Energy India's open access facility in Raichur district of Karnataka. This is Amp's third open access project in Karnataka, it said in a statement.  Bosch and Amp Energy have signed a power purchase agreement for procurement of solar power for 25 years.  The solar open access facility commissioned this month will generate about 43 million units of green energy per year for Bosch and will meet about 40 per cent of their energy consumption.  This project will provide solar power to energize Bosch's plants/facilities in and around Bengaluru and by switching to solar power, Bosch will also help mitigate about 31,000 tonne of CO2 per annum.   Solar energy adoption by top companies in India has seen a major growth over the last few years, especially post the challenges posed by the COVID pandemic. With this partnership, we are sure Bosch will set up benchmarks for other conglomerates to follow to switch to clean energy for their growth in the country and move towards accomplishing their RE100 targets,  Pinaki Bhattacharyya, MD and CEO, Amp Energy said.  Bosch is a leading supplier of technology and services in the areas of mobility solutions, industrial technology, consumer goods, and energy and building technology in India.   Bosch globally is stepping up its investments in green energy there by investing in renewable in-house generation power plants and entering into exclusive long-term purchase agreements with partners like Amp Energy.   India is an important and key market for us, and we would like to help the country reach its true potential,  Soumitra Bhattacharya, Managing Director, Bosch Ltd & Regional President, Bosch Group in India said.",

        "articleBody": "Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati have developed hybrid pervksite solar or photovoltaic devices to produce electricity from sunlight, which are highly efficient, cost effective, easy to manufacture and easily recyclable, according to officials. These devices were developed achieving power conversion efficiencies beyond 21 per cent by utilising economical solution-based photovoltaic device processing techniques at mild room temperature and realising high ambient, thermal and optical stability, they said.  A Perovskite Solar Cell (PSC) is a type of solar cell which includes a perovskite-structured compound, most commonly a hybrid organic-inorganic lead or tin halide-based material, as the light-harvesting active layer. Parameswar K Iyer, Professor at the institute's Department of Chemistry and Centre for Nanotechnology and School for Health Science and Technology, under whose supervision the research was conducted explained that the PSCs research has experienced tremendous attention due to their exponential growth in terms of efficiencies achieved within a decade. However, the perovskite materials are extremely unstable towards ambient (humidity and oxygen) conditions that restrict their commercialisation.   Organic-inorganic hybrid PSCs have experienced rapid growth in terms of efficiency and stability due to the development of highly efficient functional materials combined with careful device engineering. The materials design can be tailored at the molecular level whereas the fabrication process is printable and solution-based, making the overall solar cell development process economical and scalable,  he said.  These results obtained from perovskite solar cells have performed well beyond the commercial inorganic solar cells panels which are available in the market presently. Also, these small and large area devices performances are among the best results achieved using these classes of perovskite materials. Therefore, the strategies being developed have the potential to address the renewable energy challenges regarding the large-scale commercial fabrication of efficient and stable solar panels,  added Iyer. According to the team, among all the renewable energy sources, the energy from the sun is considered to be the most sustainable due to its ample availability on the surface of the earth. Currently, inorganic solar cell (Silicon-based) is a major player in the market. However, this technology requires high-temperature processing that results in the high price of solar panels. Further, the recycling of solar panels is hazardous and complicated.",

        "articleBody": "The CPI has challenged in court the Andhra Pradesh government's decision to award a tender for supply of 6,400 mw of solar power to the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), saying norms were violated in the bidding process.ET had reported on Tuesday that the state government has scrapped a 6,400-mw solar tender and decided to take supply from SECI at Rs 2.49 per unit. SECI is the nodal agency through which the ministry of new and renewable energy conducts wind and solar power auctions. It handles supply of renewable energy to states.According to sources, a petition has been filed by K Rama Krishna, secretary Communist Party of India (AP state), in Andhra Pradesh High Court challenging the process of selection of SECI as the power supplier.As per the National Tariff Policy, state distribution companies can procure electricity from generators through tariff-based competitive bidding.The petition has sought quashing of the procurement of solar energy from SECI, calling it illegal, arbitrary and violative of the provisions of the Electricity Act 2003, the sources said.The state withdrew its review appeal against the Andhra Pradesh High Court's June 17 order that quashed the tender saying invitations for bids for renewable energy projects must comply with the Centre's guidelines.The order was passed on a petition filed by renewable energy companies in January this year that said the tender process violated norms.The state told the high court last week that SECI has offered to supply solar power at Rs.2.49 per unit and that the government has decided to accept the offer for supply of uninterrupted 9 hours day-time free power to the farming community on a sustainable basis.Under the tender quashed by high court, Adani Green Energy and NTPC had won five mega solar power projects of 600 mw each at a tariff of Rs 2.47 per unit and Rs 2.48 per unit, respectively. Torrent Power had won 300 mw at Rs 2.47 per unit.The high court had pointed out deviations in the bidding documents--request for selection (RfS) and the power purchase agreement (PPA) from the provisions of the Electricity Act and the Competitive Bidding Guidelines (CBG) issued by the power ministry under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003.",

The expected green energy generation by NTPC in the next fiscal year (2022-23) is 10 billion units (BU). NTPC intends to achieve up to 35 GW of renewable energy (RE) capacity by 2027,  Union Power Minister R K Singh said in a written reply to a query in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.  According to the reply, NTPC has entered into the arena of green energy generation apart from managing 70 power stations.  NTPC has 2,095.5 megawatts (MW) of RE capacity, including solar, wind and hydro energy. Its RE generation in April-November this year stands at 4,089.64 million units, Singh stated.  The minister also told the House that NTPC has an under-construction green energy capacity of 3,880.5 MW, which includes solar, wind and hydro energy.  However, he told the House that the construction activities stopped at the Lata Tapovan hydropower project (171 MW) since May 8, 2014, in line with the Supreme Court order issued on May 7, 2014.  In another reply to the House, the minister also told that the energy deficit in the country was 0.4 per cent or 4,059 MU during April-November this year - a total of 9,16,575 million units (MU) of electricity was supplied against the demand of 9,20,634 MU.  The energy deficit was 0.4 per cent in 2020-21 and 0.5 per cent in 2019-20, according to the reply.  In another reply to the House, he stated that the FDI (foreign direct investment) equity inflows in the power sector stood at USD 469.31 million in April-September during 2021-22.  FDI equity inflows in the power sector stood at USD 373.63 million in 2020-21, USD 672.16 million in 2019-20 and USD 1,105.64 million in 2018-19.  In the past decade since 2011-12, the power sector recorded an FDI inflow of USD 10,184.7 million.  In another reply, the minister explained about the purchase of power at a high price and stated,  As reported by power exchanges, some buyers have purchased power at Rs 20 per kWh in the day-ahead market on power exchanges during the months of August 2021 and October 2021.   He added that this was only around 430 million units (MU), which is only 0.04 per cent of the total power generated (i.e. 9,94,233 MU) in the country during the current year 2021-22 (up to November 2021).   The average price of electricity in the day-ahead market on power exchanges during the period April to November 2021 was Rs 4.14 per unit,  the minister said.",

        "articleBody": "Andhra Pradesh has scrapped a 6,400-Mw solar tender and, instead, decided to avail of supply from the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) at Rs 2.49 per unit. The state government has withdrawn its review appeal against an order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on June 17 order that had quashed the tender saying invitations for bids for renewable energy projects must comply with the Centre's guidelines.The order was passed on a petition filed in January by renewable energy companies, which had argued that the tender process had violated norms. The state told the high court last week that SECI has offered to supply solar power at Rs 2.49 per unit and that the government had decided to accept the offer for supply of uninterrupted 9 hours day-time free power to the farming community on a sustainable basis. Under the tender floated by the Andhra Pradesh Energy Green Corp Ltd (APEGCL), Adani Green Energy and NTPC had won five mega solar power projects of 600 Mw each at a tariff of Rs 2.47 per unit and Rs 2.48 per unit, respectively. Torrent Power won 300 Mw at Rs 2.47 per unit. This development affirms our position that solar bidding cannot be carried out outside the scope of the Electricity Act, 2003. The judgment passed by the high court has now been accepted by the government of Andhra Pradesh,  said advocate Shri Venkatesh, partner, SKV Law Offices, who represented the green energy firms in the matter.The AP high court had pointed out deviations in the bidding documents -- Request for Selection (RfS) and the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) -- from the provisions of the Act and the Competitive Bidding Guidelines (CBG) issued by the Ministry of Power under Section 63 of the Act.APEGCL acts as the nodal agency on behalf of the Andhra Pradesh government to supply 10,000 Mw solar power to farmers.On November 31 last year, APGECL had initiated the tender process for setting up 10 solar power units to produce 6,400 Mw exclusively for agricultural use.APGECL had stated in its PPA that any dispute regarding the project would be settled by the state government, as against the legal requirement of moving the state or central electricity regulator.",

Keppel will invest $150 million to acquire 51% stake in the holding company, held by promoter Raju Shukla, said sources aware of the development.Singapore based Keppel Corp. and leading Indian solar energy players are in separate discussions to acquire a majority stake in Cleantech Solar Energy, ET first reported last month. A pan-Asia supplier of renewable energy, Cleantech Solar has a 600-megawatt (MW) portfolio under various stages of development across India, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore. Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd had acquired a 49% stake in Cleantech Solar in 2019.\u201cIt is indeed a matter of great pride that we now have the backing from Keppel Corporation and Shell \u2013 two world leading corporations with longterm commitment to renewable energy, sustainability, and Net Zero emissions. Cleantech is targeting to achieve a cumulative generation capacity of 3 GW within five years,\u201d said Raju Shukla, Founder and CEO of Cleantech Solar.\u201cThrough acquiring a majority stake in an established platform together with KAIF and a like-minded investor, we would be able to accelerate Keppel\u2019s growth in the renewables space, as we work towards achieving and surpassing our target of 7GW of renewable energy assets by 2030,\u201d said Loh Chin Hua, CEO of Keppel.Standard Chartered acted as exclusive Financial Advisor to Cleantech for this transaction.Keppel Renewable Energy Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Keppel Corporation, undertakes the development and operation of renewable energy infrastructure. In line with Keppel Corporation\u2019s longer-term target of growing its portfolio of renewable energy to 7GW by 2030, KRE plans to have 3GW of installed capacity by the end of 2025, according to a company website.Founded in 2015, Singapore headquartered Cleantech Solar is focused on installing high quality rooftop photovoltaic projects. Major clients include Apollo Tyres, Bosch Automotive, Cargill, Tata Steel, Akzo NObel, Coca-Cola, Siam Winery and Unilever. In India, Cleantech Solar competes with Cleanmax Enviro Energy and Petronas-owned Amplus Solar.Recently, Cleantech had secured Rs200 crore from infrastructure debt fund NIIF Infrastructure Finance Limited (NIIF IFL) for the company\u2019s portfolio of Open Access projects in India. Last year, the company had a green loan of $75 million from ING bank and also has loan facilities from SBI-World Bank and Tata Cleantech Capital.Climate Fund Managers (CFM), the climate-dedicated investment manager, had invested $50 million in 2018 in Cleantech Solar.Earlier, PE fund Warburg Pincus had sold its majority stake in Cleanmax to US based Augment Infrastructure, where Keppel Corp. was one among the suitors.At present, India\u2019s installed renewable energy capacity is about 95 GW, including 40.5 GW of solar power. The country\u2019s renewable energy capacity addition is expected to be 10.5-11 GW in financial year 2021-22, led by a strong project pipeline of about 38 GW, according to ratings firm ICRA.The sector is expected to witness investments of Rs 3.5 lakh crore over the next four years, increasing its share to 34% of the overall installed power generation capacity by March 2025 from 25% in March 2021, led by the solar power segment, the report added.In 2015, the government had declared an ambitious target of 175 GW from renewables by 2022.",

It was presented by the leaders of the two countries at the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris in 2015.  I am taking the floor on behalf of India and France. I take this opportunity to thank the entire UN membership for adopting the resolution conferring Observer Status to the International Solar Alliance (ISA). I am particularly happy that such a historic decision has been taken by the UN General Assembly under your (UNGA President Abdulla Shahid) leadership, under the Presidency of Hope,  Tirumurti said in a statement on Thursday. In a short span of six years, the ISA has become an example of how positive global climate action can be taken forward through partnerships. ISA provides a dedicated platform for cooperation among governments, multilateral organisations, industry, and other stakeholders to help achieve a common goal, he said.  Increasing the use and quality of solar energy to meet energy needs in a safe, convenient, affordable, equitable and sustainable manner enhances energy security and sustainable development, and improves access to energy in developing member countries,  he said. The granting of Observer Status to ISA in the General Assembly would help provide for regular and well-defined cooperation between the Alliance and the United Nations that would benefit global energy growth and development. Tirumurti thanked all member states, including co-signatories and co-sponsors, for this historic moment. A total of 80 countries have signed and ratified the ISA Framework Agreement and 101 countries have only signed the agreement, according to the ISA website.",

The clarification came after it found that some vendors are claiming that they are authorised by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) to install rooftop solar under Grid-connected Rooftop Solar Scheme (Phase-II). The discoms empanel vendors through the bidding process and also decide rates for setting up rooftop solar plants. Under the scheme, the ministry is providing 40 per cent subsidy for the first 3 kW and 20 per cent subsidy beyond 3 kW and up to 10 kW. The scheme is being implemented in the states by local Electricity Distribution Companies (discoms).  It has been brought to the notice of the Ministry that some rooftop solar companies/vendors are setting up rooftop solar plants by claiming that they are authorised vendors by the Ministry.  It is clarified that no vendor has been authorised by the Ministry. This scheme is being implemented in the state only by DISCOMs. The DISCOMs have empanelled vendors through the bidding process and have decided rates for setting up a rooftop solar plant,  the MNRE said in the statement. The MNRE explained that almost all the discoms have issued online processes for this purpose. Residential consumers willing to set up a rooftop solar plant under the MNRE scheme can apply online and get rooftop solar plants installed by listed vendors. For this, they have to pay the cost of the rooftop solar plant by reducing the subsidy amount given by the ministry as per the prescribed rate to the vendor. The process of which is given on the online portal of the discoms, it stated. The subsidy amount will be provided to the vendors by the ministry through the discoms. Domestic consumers are informed that to get the benefit of subsidy under the scheme of the ministry, they should install rooftop solar plants only from the empanelled vendors of the Discoms, following due process of approval by discoms, it stated. The solar panels and other equipment to be installed by the empanelled vendors shall be as per the standard and specifications of the ministry and also includes five-year maintenance of the rooftop solar plant by the vendor, the ministry added. It has also been brought to the notice of the ministry that some vendors are charging more price than the rates decided by discoms from domestic consumers, which is incorrect, it noted. Consumers are advised to pay only according to the rates decided by discoms. They have been instructed to identify and punish such vendors, it said.",

        "articleBody": "The solar energy generation capacity addition rose 335 per cent to 7.4 GW in the January-September period this year from 1.73 GW a year ago, said Mercom India Research. In the first nine months of 2021 (9M 2021), India added over 7.4 gigawatts (GW) of solar, a 335 per cent increase YoY (year-on-year) compared to the 1.73 GW installed in the same period in 2020,  according to Mercom India Research's newly released Q3 2021 India Solar Market Update.According to the update, India added 2,835 megawatts (MW) of solar in the third quarter (Q3 July-September) of the calendar year (CY) 2021, up 14 per cent compared to 2,488 MW installed in Q2 2021 (April-June). Year-over-year (YoY) installations in Q3 surged 547 per cent.Installations grew despite market challenges, according to the report.Increased raw materials costs, severe volatility in module availability and price, curtailment of power in several states, and high freight charges have added to the difficulties for the developers, it stated. Despite supply challenges, the Indian solar market is headed towards one of best years on record... We expect a strong 2022 despite the high price of components and uncertainties surrounding the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) related transmission issue in Rajasthan. An increase in GST, curtailment and payment issues are adding to the challenges facing developers and constraining growth,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group in the statement.There was a steep rise in the average selling prices of solar modules during the third quarter. Prices of mono PERC modules surged over 15 per cent q-o-q (quarter-on-quarter), with supply constraints after major manufacturers started cutting output in China. Freight charges peaked at around USD 9,000 per container in the quarter, according to the statement. Manufacturing capacity ramp-up continues at a brisk pace as domestic producers look to take advantage of the 40 per cent basic customs duty scheduled to be imposed from April 2022. \u201cIn the second quarter of next year, we can expect to see procurement strategies starting to change drastically, as imports become expensive,  said Prabhu.According to the report, module prices have been increasing for six consecutive quarters, a trend not seen in the past ten years.This quarter also saw the largest q-o-q increase in large-scale system costs by over 10 per cent attributed to the increase in raw material and component prices.Tender announcements as of September increased 16 per cent and auction activity surged 181 per cent year-on-year.Rajasthan is, now, the top solar state in India in terms of cumulative installed capacity, overtaking Karnataka, which had held the position since 2018, according to data from the report.As of September, the top 10 states accounted for about 96 per cent of the country's cumulative large-scale solar installations.Rajasthan has been the top solar installer for three consecutive quarters by contributing about 63 per cent of the total large-scale solar installations in the country this quarter, followed by Gujarat with 19 per cent.According to the report, India added close to 11.6 GW of power capacity in the first nine months of the current year.Solar dominated capacity additions accounted for close to 60 per cent, followed by thermal power, which contributed 21 per cent. Renewables (including large hydro) made up 79 per cent of total power capacity additions in 9M 2021 (CY), it stated.",

        "articleBody": "The US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) on Tuesday said it had approved up to $500 million of debt financing for First Solar, the largest American solar manufacturing company. The loan represents the largest single debt financing transaction for DFC and will support the company\u2019s previously announced vertically integrated photovoltaic (PV) solar module manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu.The facility has a projected annual capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW), the development bank said in a statement. \u201cDFC is thrilled to be in a position to support First Solar\u2019s new venture in India, which will boost solar panel manufacturing capacity for a key ally and help mobilize the industry to take up better standards that align with U.S. values,\u201d said Dev Jagadesan, DFC\u2019s acting CEO. \u201cThis transaction represents another milestone in the United States effort to drive alternative supply chains \u2013 and to articulate a vision for climate finance that drives our development mission.\u201dFirst Solar produces \u201cthin film\u201d solar panel modules, which do not use polysilicon.The company announced its intent to build the India facility in July, shortly after it unveiled plans for a new $680 million factory in Ohio that will add 3.3GW of new domestic manufacturing capacity in the United States by 2023, while creating over 700 new manufacturing jobs.The company expects to reach 16GW of global manufacturing capacity in 2024.\u201cLike the United States, India has recognized that it must shape its own sustainable energy future and has sought to supercharge the expansion of its domestic solar manufacturing capacity,\u201d said Mark Widmar, CEO, First Solar. \u201cDFC\u2019s intent to support this facility has the potential to create a high-visibility, repeatable blueprint for enabling the clean energy ambitions of like-minded nations through American innovation, ingenuity, and competitiveness.\u201dMost of the new facility\u2019s production is expected to sell into the quickly growing solar market in India, a Quad ally and key partner to the US in the Indo-Pacific region. The bank said that DFC\u2019s proposed financing promotes the US commitment to tackle climate change at home and abroad and supports India\u2019s ambitious renewable energy goals. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched a comprehensive effort to install 500GW of renewable power generation in India, which \u201cwill help save lives by reducing pollution in major cities and contributing to the response to the climate crisis,\u201d the company said.

This is due to the significantly improved financial viability of India's renewable energy projects over the last decade on account of favourable policy support from the central government, a statement said.  As recently as 2015, less than 50 per cent of the projects in the sector enjoyed such favourable ratings from credit rating agencies on their debt issuances, an independent study released by the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance said. The report also highlighted that out of the 90 renewable energy projects evaluated by three credit rating agencies in 2020 and considered in the report, only six wind energy projects had below-investment-grade ratings.  Of the 44 solar projects evaluated, 26 enjoyed an 'A' rating while nine of them were rated as 'AA' - indicating an extremely low probability of default.  Further, five solar projects received BBB ratings on their debt issuances. Similarly, of the 46 wind energy projects evaluated, 30 projects received an 'A' rating, while another 10 projects were given 'BBB' rating by the credit rating firms.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries is understood to have raised $736 million through a green loan facility to finance the Mukesh Ambani-controlled firm\u2019s acquisition of Norwegian solar panel manufacturer REC Solar Holdings in what could be the first such M&A financing from an Indian firm.Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, DBS Bank, Credit Agricole, HSBC and MUFG were among the bankers to this rare facility, which is being used for acquisition financing for the first time.The debt facility will have an interest margin of around 120bps\u2013125bps over Libor. The debt facility was taken under Singapore-incorporated REC Solar, and is secured against guarantees from Reliance New Energy Solar, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries. The loan facility consists of a $250 million six year term loan and a $150 million working capital facility, while another $460 million five year bank guarantee facility.A mail sent to Reliance Industries remained unanswered untill the publication of the report. Individual banks were not immediately available for comments.On October 10, Reliance signed a definitive agreement to buy Norwegian solar manufacturing company REC Solar for an enterprise value of $771 million from its owners China National Bluestar (Group) Co Ltd. The same day, Reliance also announced acquisition of 40 percent stake in SP Group company, Sterling and Wilson Solar.Earlier this year, Mukesh Ambani told Reliance shareholders that the company aims to turn net carbon zero by 2035, and announced huge investment plans in the alternate energy sector.Leveraged acquisition is on the rise in India as private equity funds are increasingly adopting a method of acquisition financing against the balance sheet of the target entity. IN July, Blackstone and its co-investors including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, GIC and University of California Investments raised $1.1 billion to finance their $2.9 billion acquisition of Mphasis.Mergers and acquisitions involving Indian companies hit a three-year high during the first nine months of 2021, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. Between January to September this year, transactions worth $90.4 billion were announced, representing an increase of 35.1% compared to the same period a year ago, the data showed.",

        "articleBody": "The installed capacity of solar energy in India has witnessed an 18 times increase between 2014 and 2021, the Union government informed the Lok Sabha on Monday. Responding to a query in the lower house, Minister of State for Environment Ashwini Choubey said India's current share of non-fossil sources based installed capacity of electricity generation is more than 40 per cent.  Through the National Action Plan on Climate Change and its various national missions, India is addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation across a range of sectors.  Installed capacity of solar energy in India has increased by more than 18 times from 2.63 gigawatt in March 2014 to 47.66 gigawatt in October 2021. As a result, India's current share of non-fossil sources based installed capacity of electricity generation is more than 40 per cent,  Choubey said. He said under Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme, 36.78 crores LED bulbs have been distributed to enhance energy efficiency.  Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme for energy efficiency in industries and other energy-intensive sectors resulted in total savings of approximately 13.28 million tonnes of oil equivalent, translating into 61.34 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of avoided emissions in the PAT Cycle II,  the minister said. On another query on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Choubey said according to India's third Biennial Update Report submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in February 2021, total GHG emissions, excluding Land Use Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) in 2016 were 2,839 million tonnes carbon dioxide-equivalent and 2,531.07 million tonne carbon dioxide-equivalent with the inclusion of LULUCF. UNFCCC defines LULUCF as a greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct human-induced land use, land-use change and forestry activities. As a party to the UNFCCC, India periodically submits its National Communications and Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to the UNFCCC which includes national GHG inventory, the minister told the Lok Sabha. India's total GHG emission also includes CO2 emissions from the oil and gas sector and industrial processes and product use sector. The data showed that according to the three BURs, the GHG emissions in India have increased since 2010. According to the Environment Ministry, India's total GHG emission without LULUCF has increased from 2137 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2010 to 2839 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2016. Carbon dioxide emissions in India have increased from 1,574 million tons in 2010 to 2,231 million tons in 2016.  India is making every effort to decouple its growth from emissions, by steadily lowering the emissions intensity of its GDP over the years. This keeps India's GHG emissions below what would otherwise have been emitted.  It is important to emphasise that there is no sector of India's economy and no aspect of its economic life that is untouched by the concern to keep to a low-carbon development pathway,  Choubey told the Lok Sabha. The Environment Ministry said that based on field surveys and satellite data, the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management has estimated the total extent of the seagrass ecosystem in India to be 516.59 square km.  The carbon dioxide sequestration rate of the seagrass ecosystem is estimated to be up to 434.9 tonnes per square km per year with an annual net CO2 sink of 0.75 million tonnes for an area of 517 square km,  it said. Further, the government has also initiated a project across Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha on enhancing the climate resilience of India's coastal communities at a total cost of USD 130.26 million, the ministry said. It includes a grant of USD 43.41 million by Global Climate Fund, covering 24 ecosystems in these selected states which aims to strengthen the climate resilience of coastal communities by protecting and restoring India's natural ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrass, it said.",

SSEL CEO Sharat Chandra, who is presently in Germany, said the association with Viridis.iQ GmbH would strengthen SSEL in setting up one of India's largest production facilities in the PV value chain. Executive Director of the Virids.iQ GmbH Wolfgang Herbst said collaboration with SSEL helps his company to enter into the ever-growing Indian market and strengthen the business relations between both countries. In the early stage, both SSEL and Viridis.iQ GmbH will finalise the conceptual design, devise the business plan to kickstart the project after which the German firm will extend the necessary technical/engineering support followed by construction and operations to start. Post the start of operations, the project will be supported by Viridis.iQ GmbH for up to one year to stabilise the operations. Hyderabad-based SSEL is one of the largest players in the transmission and distribution (T&D) sector. It is also a leading manufacturer of different types of transformers.",

        "articleBody": "In a bid to strengthen its footprint in the renewable space, particularly solar energy, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Thursday signed an agreement with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to scale up its clean energy projects. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Subhash Kumar and SECI Managing Director Suman Sharma, a company statement said.   The MoU provides a broad, overarching framework for ONGC and SECI to collaborate and cooperate for undertaking renewable energy projects including solar, wind, solar parks, EV value chain, green hydrogen, storage, etc,  it said.  The partnership will enable ONGC to strengthen its footprint in renewables, especially solar.  Speaking on the occasion, Kumar said:  While we appreciate the magnitude and urgency of the climate change challenge, we also understand our commitment towards energy security of the country and are committed to carrying out our business in a sustainable manner.    ONGC has a multipronged strategy to make its green energy portfolio richer and has plans to progressively move towards carbon neutrality by effective carbon management and adding renewable energy capacity,  he said.  Sharma said the pact will open new avenues of sustainable development and promises to take India to new frontiers of technology and scale.  ONGC has been pursuing green energy agenda through various alternatives and renewable sources of energy.  It has set a target of producing a minimum of 10 GW of renewable power by 2040 while continuing its focus on the core exploration and production (E&P) business.  SECI, a PSU under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), is engaged in the promotion and development of various renewable energy resources, especially solar/wind energy and renewable energy-based storage systems.  ONGC's refining subsidiary MRPL and petrochemical units OPAL and OMPL use a large amount of power in the production process, which can be replaced by green energy and hydrogen.   ONGC has cut down its carbon emission intensity by 13.67 per cent over the last five years as part of making its operations more sustainable through diverse emissions reduction initiatives,  the statement said.  ONGC is also considering India's first 200-300 MW demonstration wind offshore power project for which feasibility study is carried out jointly with NTPC Ltd.",

The installation of Adani Solar off-grid panels will help consumers mitigate the risks of power-cuts while Adani Solar on-grid panels will assist in reducing electricity costs.  Adani Solar envisages an opportunity of 130 MW within the rooftop segment in the two regions. The target customers are predominantly in the rooftop, utility-scale, residential, commercial & industrial (C&I), and solar pump segments.   With India being a growing economy with remarkable development, we will be able to offer power facilities via solar panel distribution to customers at competitive rates for applications in the East and Northeast markets,    This region has enormous investment opportunities in renewable energy. KSL Cleantech, as the authorized channel partner of Adani Solar, will be responsible for all the solar retail requirements in the region,  Ramesh Nair, Chief Executive Officer, Adani Solar, said in the statement.  On the retail front, Nair said,  Adani Solar will target a 50 per cent market share. We look forward to achieving a higher reach and visibility for our product nationally by increasing power consumption through alternative forms of energy like solar energy.   Adani Solar has rapidly expanded its retail presence across the country.

        "articleBody": "To contribute India's commitment to increase non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatt (GW) by 2030, coal and lignite companies have planned to install additional 5,560 megawatt (MW) of renewable capacity in the country with an investment of over Rs 15,000 crore, the coal ministry on Thursday said. This will take the total installed capacity to 7 GW. Coal India (CIL) alone has planned to install 3 GW of solar power in the next five years to achieve its net zero target, the ministry said in a statement.  With the recent announcement on new climate targets by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP26 under 'Panchamrit Strategy', India has taken a big step towards cementing its commitment to clean energy.  Since coal has to play a role of primary fuel for power generation in the country for the time being, till renewable source fully caters to our energy demand, the Ministry of Coal in line with the commitment has already moved forward with a comprehensive Sustainable Development Plan, according to the statement.  Action has already started for its speedy implementation. Emphasis is to put major thrust on sustainable development in coal mining, taking care of its environmental and social impact.  A full-fledged sustainable development cell (SDC) in the coal ministry has been established to advise, mentor and plan action to minimise the adverse impact of mining. Apart from suggesting the way forward, its implementation and monitoring, SDC is also formulating a future policy framework for environmental mitigation in the coal and lignite sector of the country.  Extensive work by CIL and its subsidiaries along with Singareni Coal Company Ltd (SCCL) and NLC India Ltd (NLCIL) has already started, effect of which could now be seen in some of these mining companies.  In line with the commitment of India to reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now onwards till 2030, bio-reclamation of mined out land has already been taken up on a big scale by all coal companies through a massive tree plantation drive, it said.  In the next five years, target is to cover more than 12,000 hectares of land for plantation, which will help in having carbon sink potential to the tune of more than one lakh tonne per annum. Monitoring of such efforts is being done through remote sensing.  First-mile connectivity (FMC) is a major initiative by coal companies to minimise environmental pollution, where coal is being transported through conveyor belt from coal handling plants to silo for loading. This process eliminates movement of coal through road. Taking a big step, 39 such projects have been planned to be commissioned by 2023-24 with an investment of over Rs 13,000 crore, the ministry said.  CIL alone will enhance its mechanical loading and transport of coal from the present level of 120 million tonnes to 565 million tonnes by 2023-24. These FMC projects will save diesel worth Rs 2,100 crore per annum. There will be a reduction in vehicle density by 2,770 trucks per hour paving the way for significant reduction in carbon emission.  Similarly, surface coal gasification projects have been planned for syngas production to be used further either for production of methanol/ethanol, urea or petrochemicals. This will be a way forward for use of the dry fuel as green coal with relatively lesser carbon footprintand environmental pollution, it added.  One such CIL joint venture (JV) project of 2.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity is already in operation in Talcher Coalfield in Odisha. Other five projects with an investment of about Rs 30,000 crore is under formulation by various subsidiaries of CIL.  The use of LNG to substitute diesel consumption in mining and coal transport equipment has also been planned on a massive scale. A pilot project has been initiated in one of the coal companies. This technology will be replicated shortly in coal transporting dumpers in the first phase for substantial reduction in carbon footprint, the statement said.  On showcasing the clean environment front, 12 new ecoparks in mining area are under different stages of development in all the subsidiaries of CIL, SCCL and NLCIL, and will be completed by the next year.  Extraction of sand from overburden (OB) dump for use in construction is another unique initiative for sustainable development. In addition to this, energy-efficiency measures are also being taken for reduction in carbon footprint. New environment-friendly mining equipment have been introduced on a mass scale by different coal companies to mitigate the impact of carbon emission, it said.  All these activities will pave way in coming five years for benchmarking a better sustainable development effort by coal industry on economic, environmental and social front and also in line with the commitment made in COP26.",

We worked out the details and this is a process we are pleased to be a part of. This will be an important contribution to more rapid deployment of solar globally. It will be particularly important for developing countries,  said US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.At the signing, India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav said,  This move will strengthen ISA and propel future action on providing a clean source of energy to the world. The US joining the ISA has been in the works for several years. Initially resistant, the US was not among the initial signatories. By 2016, the US decided to join the alliance. However, it was put on hold during the Trump administration. Given the criticality of solar energy in the transition to a net-zero economy underpinned by a transition away from fossil fuels and the geopolitical situation, the US participation in the ISA was a logical step. The US' endorsement of ISA's framework and approach is an heartening development, especially as our 101st member nation, which is a significant milestone in itself, demonstrating that nations across the world are recognizing the economic and climate mitigating value of solar, as well as this energy source's potential as a catalyst for global energy transition,  said Ajay Mathur, Director-General of International Solar Alliance. Solar energy is at the heart of the urgent climate action,  said Kerry in his address to the ISA Assembly.",

We worked out the details and this is a process we are pleased to be a part of. This will be an important contribution to more rapid deployment of solar globally. It will be particularly important for developing countries,\u201d he said.Union Minister for Environment Bhupender Yadav welcomed the US as the 101st member of the ISA, saying this move will strengthen the solar alliance and propel future action on providing a clean source of energy to the world. Happy that now USA is formally a part of International Solar Alliance, a visionary initiative launched by PM Shri @narendramodi Ji in 2015 at Paris COP. The number of countries who are now part of @isolaralliance is now 101,\u201d the minister later tweeted.The ISA framework, first circulated for countries to support in 2016, emphasises delivering global relevance and local benefit to all countries through collaborations.The ISA's key interventions focus on readiness and enabling activities, risk mitigation and innovative financing instruments to facilitate the promotion and deployment of solar technologies in target markets. The US' endorsement of ISA's framework and approach is an heartening development, especially as our 101st member nation, which is a significant milestone in itself, demonstrating that nations across the world are recognising the economic and climate mitigating value of solar, as well as this energy source's potential as a catalyst for global energy transition,\u201d said Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General of the ISA. We are now even more committed to translating this confidence into tangible projects and developments on the ground, accelerating the momentum of solar adoption that has been built so far. We hope remaining nations and economies will follow suit, and align with us to achieve swift, affordable and effective climate action, while also achieving their respective economic growth and long-term development priorities,\u201d he said.The alliance highlights how the approach and methods detailed in the ISA framework have already delivered results, with ISA building a solar project pipeline of nearly 5 GW installed capacity.The approach detailed in the framework is designed to culminate in a vision for interconnected global grids, which was formalised and jointly launched as the \u2018Green Grids Initiative \u2013 One Sun One World One Grid' (GGI-OSOWOG), during the World Leaders Summit of the COP26 in Glasgow last week by the UK Presidency of COP26 and India Presidency of ISA.Earlier at COP26, the United States also joined the Steering Committee of the GGI-OSOWOG comprising five members \u2013 US, Australia, France, UK, and India \u2014 and endorsed the One Sun Declaration along with 80 countries.The launch of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Francois Hollande, former President of France, in November 2015 \u2013 at the 21st session of United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP-21) in Paris, France.

        "articleBody": "The government has enabled timeline extension for solar projects facing disruptions in supply of imported solar modules, mainly from China, where severe power cuts imposed on industries have led to abrupt cost increase and retraction of several signed binding contracts.The renewable energy ministry has empowered the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) to look into any time extension requirement for projects under implementation through ministry agencies and having scheduled commissioning date before April 1, 2022, and make recommendations on a case-to-case basis. As a one-time special dispensation, DRC is authorised to take up the projects directly without waiting for the decision of renewable energy implementing agencies, the ministry said in an order issued last week.  The concerned project developer can apply to DRC within one month of this order,  it said.  Such projects shall only be required to pay minimum fee of Rs 1,00,000.  As per current dispute resolution mechanism provisions, a developer first approaches the concerned renewable energy implementing agency - Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), NTPC or NHPC - for relief. In case a developer is not in agreement with the decision of the implementing agency, they have the option of approaching DRC by filing an appeal within 21 days. A fee of 1% of the impact of dispute, subject to a minimum fee of Rs 1,00,000 and maximum of Rs 50,00,000 is also to be paid.The government has already granted time extensions to projects during the first and second waves of Covid-19.Power and renewable energy minister RK Singh told ET in an interview on October 8 that the government is mulling delaying imposition of customs duty on imported solar equipment or allowing extension of deadline for completion of domestic solar projects that are facing supply uncertainties from vendors in China.Domestic solar companies had approached the government seeking extension of the duty deadline by a year, saying Chinese companies are taking advantage of the proposed 40% customs duty on solar equipment from April next year, making Indian firms pay more than 1.5 times of the originally signed contract.",

The group said that the commitment by Adani Green and Adani Transmission will support India's commitment to increase the installed capacity of renewable energy to 450 gigawatts (gw) by 2030 and to the production linked incentive scheme (PLI) to add 10 GW solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing capacity by 2025.Adani Green has set a target of achieving 45 gw renewable energy capacity by 2030, with the average tariff below the Average Power Purchase Cost (APPC) at the national level.  AGEL will invest $20 billion in renewable energy development over the next decade and develop a 2 gw per year solar manufacturing capacity by FY 2022-23,  the statement said. Adani Transmission is in the process of increasing the share of renewable power procurement from the current 3% to 30% by financial year 2023 and to 70% by FY2030 through its utility subsidiary in Mumbai and reduce its carbon intensity on per unit of revenue basis to support SDG13 for Climate Change Mitigation.

        "articleBody": "India on Sunday told the UN climate summit in Glasgow that its solar energy capacity stands at about 45 gigawatts after it increased 17 times in the last seven years, asserting that although the country represents 17 per cent of the global population, its historical cumulative emissions are only 4 per cent.India said this while giving a presentation on its third Biennial Update Report (BUR) during the 11th Facilitative Sharing of Views (FSV) at the ongoing COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.The BUR was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in February.The key highlight of the discussion on India's third BUR was the achievement of 24 per cent reduction in emission intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the period of 2005-2014, and the significant increase of its solar programme.Making a statement on behalf of India, J R Bhatt, Adviser/Scientist in the Ministry of Environment, highlighted that India represents 17 per cent of the global population but its historical cumulative emissions are only 4 per cent, while current annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are only about 5 per cent.\u201cThis is complemented by the fact that India is particularly vulnerable to climate change. However, India is nevertheless taking several mitigation actions, spanning across the entire economy and society and has progressively continued decoupling of its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Bhatt.In the last seven years, India's installed solar energy capacity has increased 17 times, he said, adding that the solar energy capacity now stands at about 45 gigawatts.All the Parties commended India's efforts on the BUR and its climate actions, including recent announcements of new measures.There were questions about India's multilateral efforts to combat climate change, including the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).India responded by saying that disaster risk is increasing in developing countries, and this is a step to enhance international cooperation which is much needed in the current times.On the question of an increase in forest cover, India responded that people's participation has played an important role in enhancing its forest cover, and that its forests provide all the four ecosystem services.India highlighted that it speaks on climate change from a position of strength and responsibility.\u201cIndia's 15 per cent of total carbon dioxide emission in 2016 was removed from the atmosphere by the LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry).\u201cBetween 2015 and 2019, the forest and tree cover increased by 13,031 square kilometer and mangrove cover increased by 235 square kilometer. Populations of Asiatic lion, elephant, rhino increased manifold in the last 5 to 6 years,\u201d according to India's statement.\u201cWe emphasise that India is particularly vulnerable to climate change, a point which many friends overlook in their eagerness to understand our mitigation efforts.\u201cTo follow a sustainable path to development, India has taken several mitigation actions. There is no sector that has been left untouched while planning and implementing climate mitigation actions. They span across the entire economy and society,\u201d it added.",

        "articleBody": "Indian space agency can suggest the ideal location to put up a solar power farm with the data gathered from its geostationary earth observation satellites within and outside India, said a top official.He also said the technology can be transferred to those who are interested. We have demonstrated the technology in identifying the best locations for putting up the solar power plants. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing that India can offer the technology to other countries, we may get enquiries,  said K Sivan, Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and also the Secretary, Department of Space.According to Sivan, the data transmitted by the satellites will be analysed by ISRO officials.An android application for the computation of solar energy potential has been developed by ISRO's Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad at the behest of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.The tool can be used for installation of photovoltaic solar panels for tapping solar energy.Speaking at the COP26 summit Modi said:  I also want to inform today that our space agency, ISRO is going to present a solar calculator application to the world. With this calculator, the solar power potential of any place in the world can be measured based on satellite data. This application will be useful in deciding the location of solar projects and will also strengthen 'One Sun, One World, One Grid'. The application provides monthly / yearly solar potential (in kWh/m2) and minimum / maximum temperature at any location. It also displays the location on the satellite image and provides azimuth / elevation angles as well as day length over different time periods in a year.The required location can be keyed in or can be obtained through GPS, said ISRO. Location is displayed on image with satellite data in the background.It gives monthly and yearly solar potential processed using Indian Geostationary Satellite data (Kalpana-1, INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR). It also offers monthly minimum and maximum temperature to calculate realistic solar potential.Obstruction of sunlight due to terrain is also calculated using the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The application also suggests optimum tilt angle for solar PV installationThe application can be downloaded from the  New and Renewable Energy  section at vedas.sac.gov.in.It may be recalled that Modi had earlier promised a satellite for South Asian regions which was later released by ISRO in the form of GSAT-9/South Asia Satellite (formerly SAARC Satellite) a communication/meteorology satellite in 2017.Meanwhile, queried about the upcoming satellite launches, Sivan nothing has been finalised and ISRO is working on that.Sivan also said the revised foreign direct investment policy is under formulation.",

        "articleBody": "World's first partnership for interconnected solar grid, known as the Green Grids Initiative - One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG) launched on Tuesday at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.The International Solar Alliance (ISA), India Presidency of the ISA, and the UK COP Presidency unveiled plans for the first international network of global interconnected solar power grids, GGI-OSOWOG, at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, an ISA statement said.The announcement was accompanied by the One Sun declaration. Realizing the vision of One Sun One World One Grid through interconnected green grids can be transformational, enabling all of us to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement to prevent dangerous climate change, to accelerate the clean energy transition, and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.These efforts can stimulate green investments and create millions of good jobs. By sharing the sun's energy, we can help to build a more peaceful and prosperous world,  the declaration stated.The declaration has been endorsed by 80 ISA member countries.The project, being spearheaded by India and the UK in partnership with the ISA and the World Bank Group, aims to harness solar energy wherever the sun is shining, ensuring that generated electricity flows to areas that need it most.The GGI-OSOWOG will bring together a global coalition of national governments, international financial and technical organisations, legislators, power system operators and knowledge leaders to accelerate the construction of the new infrastructure needed for a world powered by clean energy.In doing so, the project aims to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy such as coal by enabling them to purchase affordable solar power from other countries.The ISA aims to help mobilize USD 1 trillion of funding by 2030 to assist developing countries in expanding their solar power grids, both in transmission and generation, to meet their energy needs.The initiative is widely seen as a big and bold move in ISA's ongoing efforts to realise a global solar transition roadmap and will go some way towards realising its vision for a solar energy future.Speaking at the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said:  The One Sun One World One Grid and Green Grids Initiative is an idea whose time has come. If the world has to move to a clean and green future, these interconnected transnational grids are going to be critical solutions. The event also featured an address by the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The UK is working hand-in-hand with our friends in India to transform the future of the power sector and ensure clean and reliable electricity is accessible everywhere by the end of this decade. It's fantastic that over 80 countries have backed our newly launched Green Grids Initiative, whose collaboration will not only see greater growth, jobs and investment in our global green future, but also make sure no one is left without access to energy,  Johnson said.ISA Director General, Dr. Ajay Mathur said:  This network has the potential to be a modern engineering marvel, and a catalyst for greatly expanding renewable electricity generation, and effectively mitigating climate change in the next decade. At a global level, almost 2600 GW of interconnection capacity may be possible up to 2050, delivering estimated power savings of 226 billion euros per year. The One Sun Declaration is multilateralism in action, with leaders of the world coming together to drive sustainable impactful change for a cleaner planet and a greener economy.  Through the power of solar and other renewables, and our collective efforts, we believe we can build and support a transition away from fossil fuels to a cost-effective solar future and open up affordable, renewable electricity supplies to markets that have been historically underserved. The project will drive global interconnectivity across the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, while leveraging African power pools.The global grid concept was first announced by Modi in October 2018 during the first assembly of the ISA. In May 2021, the UK pledged technical, financial and research support for the OSOWOG project.The International Solar Alliance (ISA), was launched at COP21 in Paris and has recently expanded its membership scope to include all UN member states. There are 90 signatories and 193 prospective members.",

Several countries prospered by the use of fossil fuels but it also left our Earth and environment poorer. The race for fossil fuels also created geopolitical tensions. However, today, technology has presented us with a better alternative,\u201d he said.Citing the \u2018Suryopanishad' during his address, Modi said that everything was born from Sun, Sun is the only source of energy and solar energy can take care of everyone. In India, it has been mentioned in the ancient text, in the Suryopanishad, that everything is created from the Sun, the source of all energy is the Sun and it is the energy from the Sun that nurtures all. Ever since there has been life on earth, the life cycle of all living beings, the daily routine has been linked with the rising and setting of the Sun,\u201d he said.Modi said that till the time this connection with nature was maintained, the planet stayed protected and healthy. However, in modern times and in the eagerness to race ahead, man disturbed the balance of nature and caused great harm to the environment. If we want to re-establish a life in balance with nature, the path to this life can only be lit by our Sun. In order to protect the future of mankind, we must go together with the Sun,\u201d he said.Calling for \u2018One Sun, One World, One Grid', Modi said it was the solution to tackle the challenge of solar power available only during the day.\u201cIn one hour, the earth's atmosphere receives enough sunlight to power the electricity needed by every human being on earth for a year. This unlimited energy is completely clean and sustainable. The only challenge is that solar energy is only available during the day and is dependent on weather conditions. One Sun, One World, One Grid is a solution for this very challenge.\u201cA worldwide grid will enable us to provide clean energy everywhere at all times. It will also reduce the need for storage and increase the viability of solar projects. It will not only reduce carbon footprint and cost of energy, but open up new avenues for cooperation between different regions and different countries.\u201cI am confident that the harmonisation between \u2018One Sun, One world, One Grid' and the Green Grid Initiative (GGI) will help in developing a joint and robust global grid,\u201d the prime minister said.He also announced that the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will soon launch an application to calculate solar power potential of any place on earth.\u201cI would also like to share that our space agency ISRO is soon going to present the world with a solar calculator application. Using this calculator based on satellite data, the solar power potential of any place on earth can be measured. This application will be useful in deciding locations for solar projects and strengthen \u2018One Sun, One World, One Grid,\u201d he said.During the event, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised Modi, saying he is among those who understands very well how to tackle climate change.",

        "articleBody": "For India to reach its bold target of having net-zero emissions by 2070, the country's solar power capacity would have to rise to over 5,600 GW, coal use particularly in the power sector will have to drop by 99 per cent by 2060 and crude oil would need to peak by 2050 and fall substantially by 90 per cent in the two decades thereafter, CEEW India has said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday surprised delegates at the COP26 climate summit with a bold pledge to cutting emissions at the world's third-biggest emitter to net-zero by 2070.Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based not-for-profit policy research institution, said,  The economic cost of India's net-zero 2070 transition (would be) over USD 13,000 billion between 2030 and 2100. For net-zero, India will have to clean up the most coal-reliant of the world's biggest power sectors. Coal-based (power) generation must peak by 2040 and reduce by 99% between 2040 and 2060,  CEEW said.  Solar-based generation capacity must rise to 1,689 GW by 2050 and 5,630 GW by 2070. Wind-based electricity generation capacity must increase to 557 GW by 2050 and 1792 GW by 2070. As of July 2021, India had 96.96 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, representing 25.2 per cent of the overall installed power capacity.The country is targeting about 450 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 - about 280 GW (over 60%) is expected from solar.On Monday, Modi raised the 2030 target for renewable energy capacity to 500 GW from 450 GW and pledged to produce half the country's electricity using renewable energy.India will also cut carbon-dioxide emissions by 1 billion tons from business as usual by the end of the decade.To deliver on the 2070 goal, the country still has to lay out a detailed plan for the 40 years in between.CEEW said the share of EVs in car sales must reach 84 per cent by 2070.  The share of electric trucks in freight trucks must total 79% by 2070, the rest being fuelled by hydrogen. The share of biofuel blend in oil for cars, trucks and airlines must touch 84% buy 2070. Similarly, coal use in the industrial sector must peak by 2040 and reduce by 97 per cent between 2040 and 2065. Hydrogen share in total industrial energy use (heat and feedstock) must rise to 15 per cent by 2050 and 19 per cent by 2070. The intensity of electricity use in the building sector with respect to total GDP must decline by 45% between 2015 and 2050 and by another 2.5% between 2050 and 2070,  CEEW said.Also, crude oil consumption in the economy must peak by 2050 and decline by 90% between 2050 and 2070, it added.",

        "articleBody": "As camels munch on the fringes of Thar desert, an oasis of blue solar panels stretches further than the eye can see at Bhadla Park -- a cornerstone of India's bid to become a clean energy powerhouse. Currently, coal powers 70 percent of the nation's electricity generation, but Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged that by 2030, India will produce more energy through solar and other renewables than its entire grid now.   First, India will increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatts... Second, by 2030, 50 percent of our energy requirements will come from renewable resources,  Modi told the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. The arid state of Rajasthan, where Bhadla Park takes up an area almost the size of San Marino, sees 325 sunny days each year, making it perfectly placed for the solar power revolution, officials say.  Once an expanse of desert, authorities have capitalised on the sparsely populated area, claiming minimal displacement of local communities. Today robots clean dust and sand off an estimated 10 million solar panels, while a few hundred humans monitor. This pursuit of a greener future is fuelled by necessity.  India, home to 1.3 billion people and poised to overtake China as the most populous country, has a growing and voracious appetite for energy -- but it is also on the frontline of climate change.  In the next two decades, it has to add a power system the size of Europe's to meet demand for its swelling population, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), but it also has to tackle toxic air quality in its big cities.   India is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world for climate change and that is why it has this big push on renewables to decarbonise the power sector, but also reduce air pollution,  Arunabha Ghosh, climate policy expert from the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, told AFP. But experts say the country -- the world's third-biggest carbon emitter -- is some way from reaching its green targets, with coal set to remain a key part of the energy mix in the coming years. - 'Huge transformation' - Although India's green energy has increased five-fold in just over a decade to 100GW this year, the sector now needs to grow by the same proportion again to meet its 2030 goals.   I believe this is more of an aspirational target... to show to the world that we are moving in the right direction,  Vinay Rustagi from renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India, told AFP.   But it would be a big stretch and seems highly unrealistic, in view of various demand and supply challenges,  Rustagi said. Proponents point to Bhadla Solar Park, one of the largest in the world, as an example of how innovation, technology, and public and private finance can drive swift change.   We've huge chunks of land where there's not a blade of grass. Now you don't see the ground anymore. You just see solar panels. It's such a huge transformation,  Subodh Agarwal, Rajasthan's additional chief secretary for energy, told AFP. Authorities are incentivising renewables firms to set up in the region, known as the  desert state . Agarwal says demand has  accelerated  since 2019.  It will be a different Rajasthan. It will be the solar state,  he said of the next decade.  If this surge is sustained then coal-fired power for electricity generation could peak by 2024, according to Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) projections.  Currently, solar power accounts for four percent of electricity generation. Before Modi's announcement the IEA estimated solar and coal will converge at around 30 percent each by 2040 based on current policies.  India's billionaires, including Asia's two richest men Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, are pledging huge investments, while Modi is setting up a renewables park the size of Singapore in his home state of Gujarat. - Show me the money - But reshaping an entire power network takes time and money, analysts warn. Around 80 percent of India's solar panels are still imported from China, the world's biggest producer. Gyanesh Chaudhary, chief executive of Indian panel manufacturer Vikram Solar, insisted there should be  more than 30  local firms like his already.   That's the kind of demand (and) ecosystem that India would essentially need... It should have happened sooner.  Experts say domestic growth has been stymied by insufficient policies, funding shortages, cheaper panels from China, and infrastructure and energy storage issues.   A lot of these plants are located at very long distances from power stations, so you have to think of linking them,  explained Apurba Mitra, World Resources Institute India's climate policy chief. Modi, who announced at COP26 that India would be carbon neutral by 2070, made it clear that such emissions-cutting pledges would require finance from rich, historic emitters.  India expects developed countries to provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest. Today it is necessary that as we track the progress made in climate mitigation, we should also track climate finance,  he told more than 120 leaders at the critical talks. - Empowering lives -  Farmer and doctor Amit Singh's three-acre family farmland in Rajasthan's Bhaloji village was running out of water and hit by frequent power outages.  I always saw the sun and its rays and wondered... why not harness it to generate electricity?,  he said.  Singh first installed rooftop panels at his small hospital which generated half of its energy needs. He then invested family savings into a government-linked project on his land. The mini-solar farm cost 35 million rupees ($450,000) and Singh sells electricity to the grid for 400,000 rupees a month.  It's the ultimate source of energy, which is otherwise going to waste... I feel I'm contributing to the developmental needs of my village,  he added.  Ghosh said it was vital to bring down costs.  When a farmer is able to generate power from their solar plant near their farm and pump out water -- we are then able to bring the energy transition closer to the people,  he added.  Pratibha Pai, the founder-director of Chirag Rural Development Foundation which has brought solar to more than 100,000 villagers, believes in clean energy's transformative role. She said:  We start with solar power... we end with safe drinking water, power for dark village roads, power for little rural schools which will hopefully script the story of a 'big' India. ",

        "articleBody": "Punjab has become the latest state to negotiate signed renewable energy contacts asking suppliers to lower tariffs, ahead of polls early next year.According to sources the Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA) held discussions with nearly 4-5 companies on Friday supplying about 1,000-Mw green power to the state. Adani Power, Azure Power, and Acme Solar are among companies supplying green electricity to the state.\u201cThe discussion revolved around high costs of renewable energy to the state and steps that can be taken to reduce the tariffs. During the meeting that state officials mentioned the possibility of reduction in tariff for power purchase agreements signed earlier,\u201d a person in the know of the development said.An official with the state government said the PPAs were signed as early as 2013-14 at nearly Rs 7 per unit while the current power tariffs are much lower. Solar power tariff in India hit an all-time low level of Rs 1.99 per unit in a Gujarat auction last December.Aditya K Singh, Associate Partner, Link Legal, said any attempt to reduce the tariff by state government will be against the specific provisions of the Electricity Act and the terms of the power purchase agreement and the state has absolutely no role to play in this area.\u201cChange in the government brings or attempts to bring various changes in the way of the functioning of the administration. Sometimes, they also attempt to travel to the path prohibited by law. There are murmurs in the corridor that the Punjab Government is contemplating to bring legislation to reduce the tariff approved by the electricity regulatory commissions,\u201d he said.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Saturday approved a proposal to terminate the power purchase agreement with 540-Mw GVK Goindwal Sahib plant. Early this year, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal promised free electricity of up to 300 units to every household if his party is elected to power, while Punjab power distribution company had last year sought discount from solar power developers citing a financial crunch.Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy attracted criticism after he decided to renegotiate contracts with renewable energy suppliers signed by his predecessor Chandrababu Naidu, soon after he resumed office in 2019.Gujarat had last year scrapped a tendering process for 700 Mw in Dholera solar park after it discovered tariff in the range of Rs 2.84 \u2013 Rs 2.89 per unit.

The project, known as the  Green Grids Initiative,  is being initiated by the International Solar Alliance, which was launched by India and France at the 2015 Paris climate conference to promote solar energy. The U.K. and India agreed to join forces in the initiative in May this year. Although solar energy is becoming cheaper than dirtier alternatives, countries cannot rely on it at night and must fall back on fossil fuels that produce earth-warming greenhouse gases. This is especially the case in countries like India, where demand for power is soaring. The new project is based on the idea that the sun is always shining in some part of the world, and the project aims to create a global grid that will transfer the sun's power from one place to another, said Ajay Mathur, the director general of the International Solar Alliance.  For example, when it is dark in east Asia, it's still light in India... If there was a cable between India and east Asia, that solar electricity could be provided to east Asia,  he said. The idea of a grid spanning regions is not new, but this is the first attempt to create a global network. Some experts view the project as India's counter to China's sweeping Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Mathur said estimates showed that in the next three years, solar power will become as cheap as power from fossil fuels, which will make it easier to build new solar power plants and storage facilities. But even then it will require countries with different priorities to reach complex agreements. The project aims to start with a  coalition of the willing,  such as two countries that would mutually benefit from the transfer of solar electricity, he said. These countries would then have to decide how they want the interconnection to work and what rules would regulate it.  The number of willing countries will keep on increasing over time, as costs lower and certainties become higher,  he said. Mathur said investors need to be assured their investment is safe and that they can get a positive return, while also ensuring that the cost of the electricity generated will be affordable. The International Solar Alliance hoped to enter into an agreement with a new group called the Global Energy Alliance, which includes philanthropy organizations and multi-laterals like the World Bank, to create a $10 billion fund for the project and help mitigate risks, he said.  So we create the projects, we take it to them and they help...make those projects safe enough to draw in investments from international organizations,  he said. Another potential challenge is if the path between two countries is impassable, for instance if the countries aren't stable. In other cases, a longer cable or one that goes beneath the ocean would be required. Any of these factors could sharply increase costs.  Even with a  fairly aggressive  timeline, Mathur said the first projects connecting different regional grids would still  take a year,  since countries first need to be convinced of the concept and then work together to determine the best way to develop the interconnection.",

        "articleBody": "Tata Steel and Tata Power, the two flagship companies of the Tata Group, have come together to develop a grid-connected solar project in Jharkhand and Odisha.The two companies have signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for a duration of 25 years to set up 41 MW solar project, which will be a combination of rooftop, floating and ground mounted solar panels, Tata Steel said in a statement.Under the project, Tata Power will develop Photo Voltaic (PV) capacities for Tata Steel at Jamshedpur (21.97MWp) and Kalinganagar (19.22MWp).Under this PPA, at Jamshedpur, Tata Power will develop rooftops PV with 7.57 MWp capacity, while floating and ground mounted capacity would be 10.80 MWp and 3.6MWp, respectively, the company said, adding that the ground mounted PV will be installed at Sonari Airport, Jamshedpur. Kalinganagar will have 9.12 MWp rooftop PV capacities, and floating PV will constitute 10.10 MWp, the company said. The estimated energy generation through 41.19MWp solar project is 6,02,80,095 kWh for the first year. During its lifetime (i.e. for 25 years), the total energy generation would be 1,40,93,61,488 kWh. The project will help save 45,210 tonnes of CO2 per year and 10,57,021 tonnes during its lifetime (25 years),  the statement said.Tata Steel and Tata Power have constantly explored opportunities to exploit renewable energy sources, which is the best way of mitigating the impact of climate change, it said.Today's announcement is yet another milestone in the common quest of both the companies to become a sustainability driven enterprise, committed to exploring clean energy solutions, it added.In March 2021, the two companies had announced to develop a 15MW solar project at Jamshedpur. This project would generate an average of 32 MUs of energy per year.It will help in offsetting approximately average 25.8 million Kg of CO2 annually. Earlier in 2017, Tata Power Solar had commissioned a 3MW Solar PV Power Plant in Tata Steel's Iron Ore Mine at Noamundi. This was the first solar power plant of its kind at any iron ore mine in the country.T V Narendran, CEO & MD, Tata Steel, said: \u201cAt Tata Steel, sustainability has always been a core principle that is embedded in its business philosophy and is backed by a long-term, holistic vision of achieving identified targets. We have taken several definitive steps across the value chain to reinforce our sustainability credentials.... We will continue with our pursuit of clean energy solutions and expand our renewable energy footprint. Praveer Sinha, CEO & MD, Tata Power, said: \u201cWe are glad to collaborate with Tata Steel to help them reduce their carbon footprint and reaffirm the Tata Group's commitment towards the adoption of clean energy. ...This blended solar PV project is yet another milestone in our shared vision of a better tomorrow and we look forward to working closely with them for covering all their other plants across the country.\u201dA signatory to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures for climate change, Tata Steel said it is committed to becoming a sustainable steel producer and has taken definitive steps to achieve this goal. The company set up India's first steel scrap recycling plant in Rohtak followed by a plant for CO2 capture from Blast Furnace gas at its Jamshedpur Works, also first in the country.Tata Steel is investing in enabling long term sustainable solutions in logistics and supply chain and has pioneered the Electric Vehicles for transportation of finished steel in the country, the company said.The company has also earned the distinction of becoming the first steel producer in the world to join the Sea Cargo Charter (SCC) to reduce \u2018Scope 3' greenhouse gas emissions in ocean trade.In line with India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), Tata Power has furthered its vision for a sustainable tomorrow with its commitment to achieving Carbon Neutrality before 2050, it said.The company is pursuing 2 GW of Solar and hybrid capabilities annually to grow more than 25 GW by 2030.

        "articleBody": "Solar energy tariff is likely to go up by 20-25 paise per unit in upcoming bids for projects as compared with rates seen over the past six months, according to an ICRA report on renewable energy. This assumes significance in view of India's ambitious target to achieve 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030.   The increase in (solar) module prices and the recent hike in GST (good and services tax) rate for solar power equipment are likely to increase the tariffs in the forthcoming solar bids by 20-25 paise per unit from the levels seen over the past six months,  the report stated.  Nonetheless, it said that the tariffs are likely to remain competitive at less than Rs 3 per unit.  The increase in cell and module prices is likely to moderate the debt coverage and return metrics for the projects bid out over the past one year and with expected commissioning over the next 6-12 months, it said.  Further, developers are likely to face delays in execution owing to the supply chain constraints arising from disruptions in China, it added.  The availability of adequate timeline buffer under the PPAs (power purchase agreement) or securing timeline extension from the bidding agency remains important, Icra said.  The price of imported Mono PERC PV modules in India has increased by over 35 per cent from 19-20 cents/watt in December 2020 to 22-23 cents per watt in June 2021 and further to 27-28 cents per watt in October 2021.  This is mainly driven by an increase in the polysilicon prices, a key input for PV modules along with the recent supply-side disruptions in China, it stated.  The disruption in manufacturing operations across the value chain of solar PV modules in China owing to the prevailing power cuts is leading to elevated price levels for solar PV cells and modules. Given the likely continuation of these power cuts amid the emission control targets in China, the prices are likely to remain elevated in the near term, it also stated.  Apart from the polysilicon, the cost pressures for solar power projects are arising from the sharp jump in the steel and aluminium prices which are used in mounting structures and back sheets for solar PV modules respectively, it said.",

At present, India's existing 15 Gw production capacity has no polysilicon or wafer production capacity.\u201cOur country has plenty of natural resources and is also endowed with vast solar energy potential. It is time we bring together these natural resources combined with the human resources and to take our country to new heights in power generation. More energy translates to more growth in economy,\u201d Shirdi Sai Electricals chief executive officer Sharat Chandra said.In total, 18 companies with a cumulative capacity of 54.8 Gw had applied for the 10 Gw scheme. The companies in the race included First Solar India that sought Rs 1,753 crore for integrated manufacturing of 3,000-Mw capacity of polysilicon to modules.Thirteen other firms including Coal India Ltd, Larsen & Toubro, ReNew Solar, Tata Power, Acme Solar and Vikram Solar had submitted proposals for manufacture of modules from wafers or cells.The Union Cabinet had in April approved the production-linked scheme for manufacture of high efficiency solar photovoltaic module scheme with a Rs 4,500 crore outlay. The incentives are expected to add 10 Gw of high-efficiency integrated solar PV manufacturing plants and bring direct investment of around Rs 17,200 crore in solar PV manufacturing.The selection of bidders under the scheme has been made on three parameters \u2014 the extent of integration, proposed manufacturing capacity and the performance efficiency of the modules.PLI disbursement to the selected bidders under the scheme will start after one year of commissioning on an annual basis based on sales, efficiency of modules and local sourcing.No PLI will be given if the selected bidders fail to fulfil commitments made under the selection criteria.",

        "articleBody": "Solar tariffs may rise to Rs 2.6-2.7 per unit from an all-time low of Rs 2 unit over next fiscal in the wake of the recent increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on renewable energy equipment, and the proposed customs duty on imported solar modules, Crisil Ratings said.The government has increased the GST on critical components of a solar project such as photovoltaic cells and modules from 5% to 12% with effect from October 1, 2021. This has increased the total taxation on a solar project from 8-9% to 12-13%. It will more than double to 30% when customs duty of 40% on imported solar modules kicks in from April 1, 2022, an official statement said.Additionally, module prices increased to 23-24 cents per watt in the first half of the current fiscal from an average 21 cents per watt (for a mono-crystalline module) last fiscal (Refer chart). This was primarily due to a significant increase in polysilicon prices - a key component used in solar cells \u2013 because of disruptions at the manufacturing facilities of Chinese manufacturers.Ankit Hakhu, Director, CRISIL Ratings, said, \u201cHigh module prices, taxes, and duties are likely to result in project cost inflation for solar developers. Compared with fiscal 2021, we expect the project cost to increase by 15-20% (Rs 60-70 lakh per MW) on average to Rs 4.2-4.3 crore per MW next fiscal from Rs. 3.6-3.7 crore/MW seen during last few fiscals. This might make future solar bids expensive at Rs 2.6-2.7 per unit compared with the lows of Rs 2.0-2.2 per unit seen during fiscal 2021, for developers to maintain returns of 11-12%.\u201d On the other hand, developers of already bid-out projects are expected to pass on the impact of taxes and duties under the change-in-law clause.The above calculation on tariffs includes an anticipated reduction in prices of solar modules to 20-21 cents per watt next fiscal, with an expectation of smoothening of silicon prices following the ramp-up in operations of the planned and existing capacities. In the absence of this correction, tariffs might further increase by 15-20 paisa per unit to maintain the said returns, the statement said.However, the distribution utilities have been wary in the past to participate in bids above Rs 2.5 per unit. For instance, the manufacturing-linked tender of 12 GW which was bid-out in January 2020 at Rs 2.9 per unit remained unsigned by the distribution utilities. Only recently in Q2 fiscal 2022, the tender saw partial acceptance by these utilities and at lower tariffs of Rs. 2.5 per unit.Aditya Jhaver, Director, CRISIL Ratings, said, \u201cAn increase in tariffs envisaged in future bids may scare away state distribution companies and add to an already large capacity of 20 GW that has been bid-out but haven\u2019t found a buyer for the electricity. On the other hand, if developers resort to aggressive bidding in a competitive market, it will likely increase the credit risk on new projects as the cash flow cushion may be thinner than earlier.\u201dThus, the ability to take suitable tariff hikes and approvals under the change in law clause remains a key driver for the credit quality of future projects.Further, while the customs duty will support the cost competitiveness of domestic module manufacturers vis-\u00e0-vis imports, no notable module price correction is envisaged from these players over the medium term as it will take some time for the domestic players to ramp up the capacities along the entire value chain, and lower their operating cost, it said.",

        "articleBody": "Cracks are emerging in the global solar industry, threatening to flatten its growth trajectory just as the world needs clean power more than ever.The sector is being slammed by a barrage of obstacles, with rising materials costs, forced labor accusations and a worsening trade war all hitting at once. As a result, panel prices are rising for the first time in years, and some manufacturers have asked buyers to delay purchases if they can. And although annual installations are still ticking higher, Wall Street warns the pace of expansion may slow sharply if those hurdles continue unchecked. \u201cThe shocks to the system in the last two to three months are more or less unprecedented,\u201d said Jenny Chase, an analyst with BloombergNEF. \u201cWe need to get to net zero as soon as possible, and to do that we just need so much solar and wind. We\u2019re not on track; we need to ramp all this stuff up dramatically.\u201dThese setbacks may only be temporary, with delays in installations expected to be largely resolved by the end of 2022 when new solar factories help ease supply chain issues. But any snag in the sector\u2019s rollout will have lasting effects, with the emissions from the fossil fuels burned instead trapping heat in the atmosphere for decades. Solar provided just 3.3% of the world\u2019s electricity in 2020. BloombergNEF estimates that to be on target for net-zero by 2050, the world needs to add 455 gigawatts of solar every year through 2030. Last year was a record\u2014and it only added 144 gigawatts. The recent stumbles are hitting right before the United Nations\u2019 COP26 climate talks begin later this month, viewed by many as a crucial\u2014and last-ditch\u2014effort to curb global warming. Slower GrowthIt was easy to be optimistic about solar coming into the year. Joe Biden\u2019s ascendance to the presidency, China\u2019s 2060 net-zero pledge and Europe\u2019s Green Deal meant that for the first time, all three dominant economies supported an energy transition at the same time. And thanks to decades of painstaking work by researchers and companies, solar can now produce energy cheaper than fossil fuels in most of the world. Even the technology\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel\u2014the sun doesn\u2019t always shine\u2014was on the way to being solved by improvements in batteries. Demand has mostly held up its end of the bargain. But the supply chain hasn\u2019t been able to match it. Largely to blame is polysilicon, an ultra-conductive material that\u2019s refined in factories, mostly in China, using caustic chemicals and copious amounts of mostly coal-derived energy. And with demand for panel production so robust, there isn\u2019t enough of it to go around.As early as January, BOCI Research Ltd. analyst Tony Fei warned that polysilicon factories could only make enough of the material for 170 gigawatts of panels, far less than some of the most bullish estimates were calling for. His call proved prescient, and prices of polysilicon quadrupled from mid-2020 to mid-2021. Now, a power crunch spurred by a shortage of coal has cut supplies of the metal used to make polysilicon, sending prices even higher. Rising steel, aluminum and freight costs are also adding up, and solar panel prices are on track for their first annual price rise since 2013.Those hurdles are starting to show up in analysts\u2019 forecasts. Guggenheim Securities LLC just removed its buy rating on four solar stocks, citing rising risks to 2022 revenue it says aren\u2019t yet reflected in consensus estimates. Earlier this month, Daiwa Capital Markets lowered its forecast for 2021 installations by 15 gigawatts, more than enough clean energy to power every home in New Jersey, with that capacity delayed until next year. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have both cautioned about near-term panel demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest solar market, while the U.S. will grow its pace of installations just 3.2% next year after a 58% jump in 2021, says BloombergNEF.\u201cWe think that input costs are starting to impact 2022 project timing,\u201d Guggenheim analysts Joseph Osha and Hilary Cauley wrote in a research note. Amid rising costs, \u201cprojects that looked marginal when contracts were signed now look unviable.\u201dPolysilicon is also at the center of a second controversy. Nearly half the world\u2019s supply is made in Xinjiang, a region in western China facing allegations of forced labor and human rights abuses against the ethnic Uyghur Muslim population there. That hit the solar world in June, when the Biden administration blocked imports of materials made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., which supplies feedstock material to several polysilicon makers. U.S. customs agents soon began issuing withhold-release orders (WRO) to detain China-linked solar panels at the border, and the issue hasn\u2019t been resolved in the months since.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of uncertainty in the industry because they do not know how strict the WRO enforcement will be, or currently is,\u201d said Kelsey Goss, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie who specializes in global solar supply chain and technology.Shortly after the first detainments, a second trade fissure opened between China and the U.S. when a group of unnamed solar companies appealed to the Biden Administration to extend Obama-era anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese solar panels to those made by Chinese-owned firms in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam\u2014where the U.S. gets nearly 80% of its panels. The U.S. Department of Commerce has yet to decide whether it will even investigate the appeal, but just the threat of the case has caused some companies to stop sending panels to the U.S., according to the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group.\u201cThis had an immediate chilling effect on the market,\u201d said George Hershman, president of Swinerton Renewable Energy. \u201cManufacturers started to hold orders immediately.\u201d Deployment GoalsChina\u2019s five biggest panel makers, which account for around half the world\u2019s supply, last month asked customers in an open letter to delay purchases to avoid supply chain carnage. Now, some U.S. solar construction companies have started sending workers home because there are no panels available, according to Roth Capital Partners.Of course, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom with solar. Even with the price hikes, solar panels are still cheaper now than they were in October 2018, and installations keep inching higher. New polysilicon factories and an eventual end to China\u2019s power crunch promise to bring prices back down by 2023 at the latest. And even amid all the hubbub, solar companies continued to improve their technology and manufacturing efficiency this year, promising continued cost improvements in the future. Not to mention that solar\u2019s biggest competitor, fossil fuels, are mired in their own supply issues that have sent coal and natural gas prices to record levels.That\u2019s scant relief, though, for installers like India\u2019s Gautam Das, trying to add solar capacity today. Das, 47, who left his job as head of Treasury products at Citibank India to start solar developer Oorjan Cleantech in 2016, is projecting revenue to grow five-fold this year. But he\u2019s faced a hiccup recently when the price of modules in India jumped by about 20%. The company took hits to its profit on some projects and shared the increased cost with customers on others.For some developments, he said, there was no choice but to delay installation and hope prices fall in a few months, which is bad news for both the customers and overall emissions.\u201cAs a country, and as an entrepreneur, I believe more solar is better and faster is better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a 20% jump in a month, that\u2019s a big uncertainty and a big hindrance to solar adoption.\u201d(With assistance from Brian Eckhouse)",

The Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of 11 ISA member countries namely Comoros, Ethiopia, Fiji, Guyana, Jamaica, Kiribati, Malawi, Senegal, Togo, Tonga, and Niger have been formally approved by Ajay Mathur, Director General, ISA. A formal signing-in ceremony was hosted by ISA at its fourth general assembly held from October 18-21.   ISA will provide a grant of up to USD 50,000 to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SID) member countries to undertake Demonstration Solar projects,  a statement said. Among other things, the initiative of demonstration solar projects aims to provide technical and financial support to LDCs and SIDS member countries of ISA to implement demonstration projects and support resilience building in key sectors such as agriculture and health in the backdrop of COVID crisis.  ISA is continuously looking at ways and means to support the socio-economic goals of our member countries. These grants reflect our commitment to their accelerated solarization. The projects supported through these grants will also help identify the modifications in national policies and processes that will enable fast replication,  Mathur said. As on date, expressions of interest to initiative solar demonstration projects from 27 member countries have been received, and 77 bilateral meetings organized with the member countries to discuss the initiative in detail and to provide clarifications and assistance to develop the DPRs. Seven member countries - Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Fiji, Senegal, and Sudan - have opted for demonstration project implementation by ISA. These projects will be implemented through NTPC, which is ISA's Project Management Consultancy.  Besides, 13 members have opted for direct implementation.",

        "articleBody": "The fourth General Assembly of multilateral body International Solar Alliance (ISA) concluded on Thursday with a promise to achieve USD 1 trillion global investments in solar energy by 2030. The fourth General Assembly of the ISA was held virtually between October 18 and October 21. It was presided over by Union Power and New and Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh, who is also the president of the ISA General Assembly.   The General Assembly approves a solid action agenda to mobilize USD one trillion... in solar investments by 2030, including a blended finance risk mitigation facility,  ISA said in a statement.  A total of 108 countries participated in the assembly, including 74 member countries, 34 observer and prospective countries, 23 partner organisations and 33 special invitee organisations.  US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry delivered the keynote address, and European Commission Executive Vice President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, addressed the gathering on October 20.  During the General Assembly, two new programmes were launched -- management of solar PV panels and battery usage waste and solar hydrogen programme, it said.  The new hydrogen initiative is aimed at enabling the use of solar electricity to produce hydrogen at a more affordable rate than what is available currently (USD 5 per KG), by bringing it down to USD 2 per KG.  Making hydrogen cost competitive with natural gas presents major challenges for both supply and performance. However, bringing down the costs can unlock a cascade of benefits.  The discussions at the assembly highlighted that the MSME clusters can replace diesel gensets with hydrogen, which are viable even at today's solar hydrogen prices.  The discussions also focused on how ISA's waste management programme will be pivotal for the growing volume of waste and toxic materials, lack of waste specific legislation, and high cost of waste treatment.  An update on the One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) initiative was also discussed at the assembly.  The concept of a single global grid for solar was first outlined at the First Assembly of the ISA in late 2018. It envisions building and scaling inter-regional energy grids to share solar energy across the globe, leveraging the differences of time zones, seasons, resources, and prices between countries and regions.  The OSOWOG will also help decarbonise energy production, which is today the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions.  Aiming to synergise its efforts and actions with other similar initiatives globally, OSOWOG has joined hands with GGI (Green Grid Initiative) to form a unified GGI-OSOWOG initiative.  This aims to contribute to the collaborative, rapid development of resilient grids globally -- building on continental, regional and national grid infrastructure programs.  The UK COP Presidency, the Government of India, and the Presidency of the ISA, are expected to announce this collaboration at COP26 to facilitate increased technical, financial, and research cooperation to help deliver the joint vision of the two initiatives.  This collaboration will be another leap towards a global ecosystem of interconnected renewables shared for mutual benefits and global sustainability and collectively become as one of the most resilient steps to mitigate climate change and support the global energy transition.  The ISA also announced a partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies to mobilise USD 1 trillion in global investments for solar energy across ISA member countries.  The two organisations will work with the World Resources Institute (WRI) to develop a Solar Investment Action Agenda and a Solar Investment Roadmap, which will be launched at COP26.  Delivering the presidential address, Singh said,  It is time for all of us to get together to make energy access using solar and renewable energy available. We have successfully done this in India, and it can be replicated globally.    Solving the problem of energy access is more important than the energy transition. The energy transition is meaningless for those without energy. The ISA can enable energy access for 800 million people worldwide,  it added.  He further said it is time for developed countries to direct the energy transitions funds they had committed at previous climate conferences. ISA will cover credit guarantees and help in driving green energy investments in these countries.   Developed nations must decide whether economic development should take place through clean energy, or by burning coal and firewood. The developed world cannot escape this responsibility,  he added.  ISA Director General Ajay Mathur said,  ISA targets USD 1 trillion of investment in solar by 2030, which would be significant in bringing the world closer to energy transitions needed.   The ISA is an inter-governmental treaty-based organisation with a global mandate to catalyse solar growth by helping to reduce the cost of financing and technology.",

        "articleBody": "Union minister R K Singh on Wednesday said the world should come together to promote the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which has the potential to provide energy to 800 million people globally.  Solving the problem of energy access is more important than the energy transition. The energy transition is meaningless for those without energy.   Today, there are 800 million people who lack energy access, worldwide. It is incumbent upon the developed nations to ensure this access. Without their support, development will inevitably be through fossil fuels,  Singh said while addressing the ISA general assembly.  The Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister called upon the world to work together and enable ISA to make energy available to all using solar and renewable energy.  He pointed out that ISA was founded to bring the global community together,  synergize our efforts, leverage our complementarities to overcome such barriers .  He said ISA can play the primary role in providing energy access to all.  In his opening address at the inaugural ceremony of the ISA general assembly where 106 countries are participating in the discussions, Singh said adoption of renewable energy has gained significant momentum since the turn of the past decade.  Solar energy, in particular, is now the most viable option to achieve universal access to sustainable energy due to its affordability and amenability to off-grid solutions.  It is the most viable option for us to rapidly de-carbonize our energy sectors,  he added.  India has made rapid strides in the solar energy sector over the past few years and rapid capacity addition is a testament to India's commitment to clean and affordable solar energy.   India has target to reach 450 GW of RE by 2030. We have 154 GW of installed non fossil generation capacity and another 67 GW under construction. India's non-fossil fuel based capacity is on-track to surpass the 40 per cent target under India's NDC (nationally-determined contribution),  he said.  Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Change, United States, John Kerry applauded ISA and the leadership of India, France and member countries of the ISA assembly in their collaboration to advance the global clean energy transition,  He said, It is really terrific to see India leading the ISA. India is a close partner and the US strongly supports India's goal of reaching 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. We believe that it's absolutely doable and will be done. India has already set an example for emerging economies by reaching 100GW of renewables.   What India has demonstrated with its low-cost solar auctions and build out of the transmission grids and massive solar parts program and other innovative policy tools can be replicated all over the world, Kerry said.  He added that ISA is critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has an opportunity to accelerate solar's growth with member countries blessed with the world's strongest sunlight.  Speaking on India-US ties and calling India,  a red-hot investment destination for solar power,  Kerry shared that, leading countries deploying solar power from India to the US are seeing the need for energy storage to balance the intermittency of renewable energy.  Harnessing the full value of solar energy will require countries to invest in storage, grid infrastructure and in flexibility in both demand and supply. And to connect solar power with parts of the economy that don't currently use electricity, countries must invest in electric vehicles and clean fuels like hydrogen that can be produced using solar power, he added.  European Commission Executive-Vice President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans participated in the opening session of the ISA general assembly and confirmed the European Union's support to the initiative.  He also announced the imminent launch of a project, worth around 1 million euros, funded by the European Union, aiming at further strengthening the engagement of EU, EU Member States, & EU academic, business and financial communities with the International Solar Alliance.",

        "articleBody": "The prestigious Science Museum in London has announced a landmark new gallery on Tuesday, which will examine how the world can undergo the fastest energy transition in history to curb climate change, with a subsidiary of the Adani Group being the title sponsor. Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery is supported with title funding by Adani Green Energy, India's leading solar power developer which aims to be the world's largest renewable power generating company by 2030.  The new gallery, which will open in 2023, was announced as delegates gathered for a Global Investment Summit hosted at the museum by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.   We are delighted to support the Energy Revolution gallery, which will explore how society can power the future through low carbon technologies,  said Gautam Adani, Chairman of Adani Green Energy.   The Renewable Energy revolution to get to this point has been remarkable. The limitless power of the wind and sun is awe inspiring and our ability to harness that power is finally within reach. There is so much to learn from the history of this journey as the world writes a cleaner future and who better than the Science Museum team to depict this inspiration,  he said.  The gallery will explore the latest climate science and the energy revolution needed to cut global dependence on fossil fuels and achieve the Paris targets to limit global warming to around 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  Visitors to the new gallery will see how data visualisations and future projections are key to generating knowledge, informing decisions about how we live and stimulating creative and innovative solutions.   Imagining our collective future, as this gallery will encourage, provides us all with a powerful action programme,  said Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the Science Museum Group.   This gallery will take a truly global perspective on the world's most urgent challenge. We face a grave threat, but the future is not predestined - it is still in our hands if we can build the coalition required for urgent and far-reaching action,  she said.  The gallery will draw on the Science Museum Group Collection and loans, deploying a range of interactive and digital storytelling techniques to reveal the latest science as well as exploring energy revolutions of the past and future.  Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery is being developed around four thematic sections, each providing a different lens on this century's defining challenge - Alternative Futures, which uses examples from history to scrutinise the moments when people have imagined different kinds of energy futures; Future Planet which considers present day projections of the future; Future Energy and Power, which focuses on the technologies with potential to support a global shift to a low carbon future; and Future Living, which explores energy systems that determine how we live, work and get around.  The gallery will highlight moments from the past when energy futures were imagined.  A rare surviving Edison tube, on display for the first time after recently joining the Science Museum Group Collection, will enable visitors to marvel at this engineering feat when the new gallery opens in two years' time.  Climate change projections are made possible because of long-term global observations that show how our planet is already changing. One fundamental series of observations was initiated in 1958 by Charles David Keeling, who began measuring carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.  One of the air-sampling flasks he used will be on display in the new gallery.",

        "articleBody": "The global solar sector, including the Indian market, has witnessed total corporate funding of USD 22.8 billion in the January-September 2021 period, registering a nearly three-fold jump over the previous year, according to a report. Corporate funding includes venture capital (VC) funding, public market and debt financing, Mercom Capital Group said in the report on Monday.  The total corporate funding increased 190 per cent in the first nine months of 2021, with USD 22.8 billion in 112 deals as compared with USD 7.9 billion in 72 deals in the same period of 2020, the global clean energy communications and consulting firm said.  Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said,  Investments continue to be robust across the solar sector. This will end up as one of the best years for solar financing since 2010. As the push toward the energy transition picks up speed worldwide, solar is benefitting enormously.   Prabhu added that solar project acquisitions in the first nine months of 2021 have already surpassed all of 2020.  The global solar sector brought in USD 2.2 billion in VC funding in 39 deals, registering a rise of 466 per cent compared to USD 394 million in 29 deals during January-September 2020.  In India, Premier Energies, a solar photovoltaic (PV) cell and module manufacturer, raised USD 27.11 million from GEF Capital Partners.  Public market financing into the solar sector came to USD 6.3 billion raised in 23 deals, up 209 per cent compared with USD 2 billion in 10 deals in the year-ago period.  In the public market financing space, ReNew Power from India was listed on the Nasdaq after completing a business combination with RMG Acquisition Corporation II. With this deal, RMG II became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ReNew Energy Global.  During the period under review, there were a total of 83 merger and acquisitions (M&As) transactions compared to 42 deals in January-September 2020.  The largest M&A transaction was by Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), which agreed to acquire a 100 per cent stake in SB Energy India from Soft Bank Group (80 per cent) and Bharti Group (20 per cent). The transaction values SB Energy India at an enterprise valuation of about USD 3.5 billion.  The M&A deals in India came from ReNew Power which has signed a definitive agreement to acquire 260 MW of operational solar projects in Telangana.

        "articleBody": "The International Solar Alliance's fourth general assembly will be held virtually from October 18-21 which will deliberate on key initiatives in the solar energy sector, including the operationalisation of One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG). The Assembly will be presided over by R K Singh, Minister for Power, New and Renewable Energy and the President of ISA, a statement by ISA said.  It will deliberate on the key initiatives around the operationalisation of the OSOWOG initiative, the USD 1 trillion Solar Investment Roadmap for 2030, and approval of a Blended Financial Risk Mitigation Facility.  A series of technical sessions on various strategic initiatives of ISA will be conducted. Besides, technical sessions on various emergent issues in the solar and clean energy sector will be conducted in collaboration with partners and other organizations.  Discussions will be held on the strategic plan of ISA for the next five years encompassing a Country Partnership Framework, Strategy for Private Sector Engagement, and initiatives such as Viability Gap Financing scheme to facilitate affordable finance for solar energy projects across ISA's membership.  ISA will also discuss the partnership with Global Energy Alliance to scale up technical and financial support to least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), the statement said.  A detailed report on OSOWOG is expected to be discussed at the Assembly. The concept of a single global grid for solar was first outlined at the first general assembly of ISA in late 2018, it stated.  It envisions building and scaling inter-regional energy grids to share solar energy across the globe, leveraging the differences of time zones, seasons, resources, and prices between countries and regions.  OSOWOG will also help decarbonise energy production, which is today the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions.  The Assembly is the apex decision-making body of ISA, in which each member country is represented.  ISA is an international organisation with 98 member countries. It works with governments to improve energy access and security around the world and promote solar power as a sustainable way to transition to a carbon neutral future.  U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry will deliver the keynote address on October 20. The European Commission Executive Vice President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans will also address the gathering on October 20.",

Actis has a significant track record of investing in Indian renewables where it has invested $800 million over the last 7 years to establish Ostro Energy and Sprng Energy with 3 GW of solar and wind capacity.The LP (limited partner or investor) base of the new fund includes pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and other investors from across the globe, it added. \u201cWe are glad to have successfully closed this fundraising. We are committed to the Indian renewable sector and will continue to be a leading investor in Indian green energy,\u201d said Sanjiv Agarwal, Partner Actis & Head of Energy for Asia.\u201cThis is a ringing endorsement for our proven track record and a significant milestone for the firm as we continue to build our market position as a leading investor in sustainable infrastructure globally,\u201d said Torbjorn Caesar, Senior Partner at Actis. The UK based Actis had sold its clean energy platform in India - Ostro Energy to ReNew Power Ventures in 2018 at an enterprise value of $1.5 billion. Currently, Actis plans to sell its India clean energy platform Sprng Energy and has mandated Bank of America to find a buyer.Three years after it successfully sold its clean energy platform Ostro Energy, Actis has mandated Bank of America to officially launch a formal process to divest Sprng Energy for an enterprise valuation of $2.5-$2.75 billion, ET reported last month. Sprng Energy was set up by Actis Fund 4 with an equity commitment of $450 million in March 2017 for investments in the renewable sector in India. The platform currently has an operational portfolio of 1.7 GW (750 MW of solar and 797 MW of wind energy projects). Another 194 MW of solar power projects are under construction.India has attracted investments to the tune of Rs 1.32 lakh crore in the renewable energy sector in the past three years since 2017. At present, India\u2019s installed renewable energy capacity is about 95 GW including 40.5 GW of solar power.",

        "articleBody": "India should increase its solar power capacity to 5630 gigawatt in order to become a net-zero emissions nation by 2070, according to a study. At present, India has 100 GW of installed renewable energy capacity, of which solar comprises 40 GW, the study released by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) on Tuesday said. The government has set an ambitious target to scale up its total renewable energy capacity to 450 GW by 2030. India's total installed solar power capacity would need to increase to 5630 GW if it were to commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2070,  the study titled 'Implications of a Net-zero Target for India's Sectoral Energy Transitions and Climate Policy' said.The country would also need to develop the requisite recycling capacities to handle the solar PV (photovoltaic) waste generated, it said.The study further said that to achieve net-zero target by 2070, usage of coal especially for power generation would need to peak by 2040 and drop by 99 per cent between 2040 and 2060.Further, the consumption of crude oil across sectors would also need to peak by 2050 and fall substantially by 90 per cent between 2050 and 2070.Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Fellow, CEEW, said,  As we move towards a net-zero future, energy prices could rise in the short run and workers that are a part of the fossil-fuel economy could lose jobs.  Hence, developed countries should offer generous financial and technological support to the developing ones to help them set ambitious goals regarding emissions reduction while ensuring a just transition. Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, said, developed economies should significantly advance their target of achieving net-zero and not wait till 2050.This will give developing countries room to pursue a just and sustainable energy transition, the CEO said.To meet the target, India should also co-invest and co-develop new green technologies in partnership with other countries to create new jobs and markets. Green hydrogen is one such technology that could replace coal in the industrial sector, Ghosh said.According to the CEEW study, in 2070, electric or battery-driven passenger vehicles would comprise 84 per cent of total cars sold in the country.Around 79 per cent of all trucks would run on battery-electric technology and rest on hydrogen. Households across the country would also have to use electricity as the primary cooking fuel.CEEW is a not-for-profit policy research institution.",

The investment makes RIL a strategic lead investor in the company, which is developing and producing monocrystalline silicon wafers, also called green solar wafers, which are cost effective.\u201cOur investment in NexWafe signals an important step towards accelerating India\u2019s green energy transition and positioning India as a global leader in photovoltaic manufacturing,\u201d RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a statement. \u201cWe believe NexWafe\u2019s innovative ultra-thin wafer will give solar manufacturers a significant advantage over existing photovoltaic technologies, helping consumers in India and globally realize the benefits of solar energy more quickly and more efficiently,\u201d Ambani added.The transaction is proposed to be completed by end of this month.RIL will help NexWafe accelerate product, technology and commercial development for the latter\u2019s solar photovoltaic products. The two companies have also entered into an \u2018India Strategic Partnership Agreement\u2019 that provides for joint technology development and commercialization, at scale, of high efficiency monocrystalline \u201cgreen solar wafers.\u201dThis will allow RIL secure access to NexWafe\u2019s proprietary technology and plans to build large-scale wafer manufacturing facilities in India using the NexWafe processes and technology.Separately, RIL also notified the bourses late on Tuesday that RNESL had signed a memorandum of understanding with Danish company Stiesdal A/S with the aim to partner and cooperate on the completion, development, and subsequent manufacturing in India of hydrogen electrolysers, which is being developed by Stiesdal. According to the MoU, Steisdal will grant a technology license to RNESL for this purpose.Both announcements are in line with Ambani\u2019s ambitious plans of investing Rs 75,000 crore over the next three years to build a new clean energy business to fuel the conglomerate\u2019s commitment to be net carbon neutral by 2035.The plan entails three parts\u2014a Rs 60,000 core investment in four giga factories that will manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components for the business; a Rs 15,000 crore investment in building the value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries; and repurposing the company\u2019s engineering, project management and construction capabilities toward clean energy.On Sunday, RIL announced two acquisitions in the clean energy space through its arm Reliance New Energy Solar. The company said that it will acquire 100% stake in solar panel manufacturer REC Solar Holdings AS (REC Group) from China National Bluestar (Group) Co for an enterprise value of $771 million (around Rs 5,802 crore). RIL also announced the acquisition of 40% stake in Sterling & Wilson Power, which is into engineering, procurement and construction for solar power projects.Prior to this, in August, RIL made its first strategic move in the renewable energy sector with an investment of $50 million in US-based energy storage company Ambri Inc.\u201cWith RIL\u2019s plan in place for solar manufacturing, we now incorporate the planned capex for solar capacity of up to $5 billion in our model,\u201d HSBC Global Research said on Tuesday, before the most recent announcement.\u201cWe also adjust our estimates to account for improved refining margins and faster acquisition of telecom subscribers. This results in a 5-13% increase in our earnings estimates and 15% increase in our target price.\u201dThe brokerage maintained its \u2018hold\u2019 rating on shares of RIL but increased the price target to Rs 2,350 a share from Rs 2,050 earlier.On Tuesday, RIL shares closed at Rs 2,668.5 apiece on the BSE, up 0.7%.

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has said that India is set to achieve 450 GW renewable energy installed capacity by 2030. Earlier this month, the MNRE in partnership with FICCI, organised a series of events, from October 6-8 during the Climate and Biodiversity Week at Expo 2020 Dubai.  The events covered the themes like 'India's Renewable Energy Achievements and Ambitions; Emerging Areas and Opportunities for Renewable Energy in India. The events were anchored by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA).  An event on the theme of 'One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG)' was also organised by International Solar Alliance promoting interconnective across borders to harness solar energy without intermittency.  Addressing the MNRE-FICCI - SECI event, RK Singh, Minister of Power, New and Renewable Energy, emphasised that the world is on the cusp of transformation, and immediate corrective steps are needed to mitigate climate change.  He highlighted that energy transition needs to be the first step in this direction.  He said that India is already ahead of what  we pledged in our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)  and added that,  already 39 per cent of our installed capacity is from non-fossil based sources. By 2022 we will reach our target of 40 per cent .   India set to achieve 450 GW renewable energy installed capacity by 2030,  an MNRE statement said.  Highlighting that transmission is a challenge and getting it into place is work in progress, the minister said,  We are launching the Green Corridor Phase 2 and we are generally expanding transmission to put in place systems for renewable power evacuation from sites where irradiation is high, or wind speed is high.   Singh also said that intermittency of renewable power is another challenge for the entire world highlighting that battery storage per unit currently is high and needs to come down.  He added that the government is coming out with bids for battery storage.  There is a Production Linked Incentive for battery storage already in place and demand needs to be encouraged to bring down the prices of storage, Singh added.  Speaking on the opportunities for green hydrogen in India, Singh said,  MNRE will work out with bids for electrolysers and that mandates for green hydrogen consumption in refining, fertilizer, piped natural gas.   Singh also said that SECI has had promising growth and is expected to continue this momentum as new and emerging areas in the clean energy space are set for a boom and stated his vision of SECI becoming an energy conglomerate of the new world.  India has embarked on an exciting journey and is treading where no one has ventured before, and SECI will continue to work towards meeting the ambition of 450 GW by 2030, the minister said.  Bhagwanth Khuba, Minister of State, New and Renewable Energy, Chemicals and Fertilizers, Government of India, said the energy sector is set to undergo a drastic transformation across the globe and the future belongs to the renewable energy.   This is going to be a collective effort and our energy transition will be inclusive and equitable so that no one is left behind. We welcome all our partners to come and invest in India and join us in this incredible journey,  he added.  He further said that in view of the 175 GW installed RE capacity by 2022 announced in 2015 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India surpassed the 100 GW milestone (excluding large hydro) in 2021. He also added that as of now India has only tapped a fraction of the vast potential for renewable energy and, therefore, India has raised the target to 450 GW RE installed capacity by 2030.  Inviting global stakeholders, on day two of the event, Khuba reiterated the benefits of investing in India's RE sector and highlighted that ensuring Ease of Doing Business has been India's utmost priority.   We have established dedicated Project Development Cell (PDC) and FDI Cell in all ministries for handholding and facilitating domestic and foreign investors. 100 per cent FDI is also permitted through direct automatic route,  he emphasized.  In his Keynote address on the theme of Renewable Energy in India: Emerging Areas and Opportunities, Khuba added that India is set to tap into more than 70 gigawatt of off-shore wind potential.   India now has decided to ramp up its solar module manufacturing capacity. The Government of India has recently launched the Production Linked Incentive scheme for the manufacture of High Efficiency Solar PV Modules. We expect to add 10 GW of solar PV manufacturing capacity over the next five years,  he said.  He further said,  Green hydrogen is going to play an important role in decarbonising our economy especially in the hard-to-decarbonise sectors. India is developing the National Green Hydrogen Energy Mission to scale up green hydrogen production and utilisation across multiple sectors.   India is targeting initially approximately 1 million tonnes annual green hydrogen production by 2030, he said.  Khuba said that India's ambitious target of 450 GW opens up investment opportunities to the tune of USD 221 billion by 2030. This will be a long-term investment into sustainable development for our future generations, he added.   I invite partner countries and business leaders of the world to come and join us in this unprecedented journey we are undertaking,  said Khuba.  Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi, Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, said the current RE capacity additions in India are a result of favourable public policy to a large extent and the private sector has played a key role in achieving this.  He further stated that the government is making policy ecosystem more favourable to the RE sector.  On the topic of the general investment climate in India's RE sector and new and emerging areas of opportunities for investors, Chaturvedi said that MNRE is making continuous efforts towards ease of business reforms and issues are addressed on a regular basis.  These include a set of robust RE bidding guidelines, dispute resolution mechanism, among others due to which the sector has seen investment of about USD 70 billion in the last about seven years.  Chaturvedi listed three new areas of emerging opportunities for investors - green hydrogen, off-shore wind, and solar PV manufacturing. Mandatory purchase obligations are intended to increase use of green hydrogen in sectors like fertilizers, petroleum refining, and city gas distribution.  He said that in off-shore wind, government support and investments from domestic and foreign players will be required over the next few years.",

        "articleBody": "After announcing the $771 million acquisition of REC Solar from ChemChina, Reliance Industries is also buying Sterling and Wilson Solar from its promoters, making a big splash towards its renewable energy foray, the company said on Sunday late evening. Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. Pvt. Ltd (SPCPL) and Khurshed Yazdi Daruvala, promoter-shareholders of Sterling and Wilson Solar, cumulatively own 69.36 per cent of the company, with the public owning the rest. The promoters had raised Rs 2,850 crore from the public through an IPO in 2019, but subsequently failed to repay the loans of the company a year later, though it was promised in the prospectus. This created a future among shareholders who demanded an exit for their investments citing a breach of trust.Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd (RNEL), a wholly owned arm of Reliance Industries will be issued fresh shares of Sterling and Wilson as a preferential allotment of 2.93 crore shares at Rs 375/share, representing 15.46% of the company\u2019s expanded equity base. Another 9.70% of the company will be acquired by RNESL from Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. Pvt. Ltd at the same price. It will also trigger an open offer for an additional 25.7% of the company as per Indian takeover regulations and if fully successful, RNESL will hold 40% stake involving a total pay out of Rs 3630 crore.       86926253The market capitalisation of Sterling and Wilson Solar as on Friday was Rs 6,972.45 crore.The company had a consolidated net loss of Rs 76.02 crore against a net profit of Rs 17.22 crore in the quarter ended on June 30, 2021.The stock however has zoomed 60% in the last 3 months in anticipation of a deal. On September 29 this year, SP Group and SWSL repaid an outstanding debt of Rs. 2,563 crore, further paving the way for a transaction. ET in its edition dated September 8th was the first to report that Sterling and Wilson\u2019s promoters are looking at divesting their stake and might even give up control and was in talks with players like Adani Group, RIL, Brookfield among others. Sterling and Wilson is one of the world's leading EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) players, and has executed projects worth 11 GW across the globe though in the recent past been overtaken by Tata Power\u2019s EPC division as the SP\u2019s Group debt overhang slowed its growth prospects forcing the Mistry family to sell down family jewels like Eureka Forbes. In March, the Reserve Bank of India-appointed KV Kamath committee approved a one-time restructuring package for 150 year old SP Group\u2019s Rs 10,900 crore debt under the Covid-19 relief framework. The sell offs are part of that exercise.As on August 14, 2021, the company\u2019s unexecuted order book stood at Rs 8,731 crore, which is executable over the period of next 12 to 15 months. With the two transactions, Reliance will become among the top players in two crucial areas of solar renewable projects: solar cell manufacturing and EPC, a time when the dominance of Chinese manufacturers have come under heightened global scrutiny. It also gives Reliance access to cutting-edge technology and global manufacturing capabilities as well as a domestic base that will help the group with a strong foundation.It also has invested in US-based battery storage technology company Ambri Inc, along with Bill Gates and Paulson and Co.These deals come at the heels of Ambani's announcements for ambitious green energy plans with the setting up of the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar, at the company\u2019s 44th annual general meeting in June. With a $10-billion investment, the company plans four giga factories \u2014 an integrated solar PV plant, advanced energy storage battery manufacturing unit, green hydrogen, and fuel cell facility.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries formally announced the outright acquisition of Norwegian solar manufacturing company REC Solar for an enterprise value of $771 million, it said in a statement on Sunday.ET had reported about the developments of the transaction in its August 31 edition.Reliance, who made the deal through its wholly owned subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar, will use REC's advanced technologies and patents to build a 4 gigawatt (GW) manufacturing facility in Jamnagar, Gujarat as part of its 'giga factories'. This unit will eventually be scaled up to 10 GW.The company plans four 'giga factories' \u2014 an integrated solar PV plant, advanced energy storage battery manufacturing unit, green hydrogen, and fuel cell facility. [The deal] is in line with our strategy of investing in new and advanced technologies and operating capabilities aimed at achieving Reliance\u2019s goal of enabling 100 GW clean and green energy before the end of this decade,  Ambani said in a statement.The billionaire also signalled RIL's intentions to continue making more acquisitions in the renewables sector. We will continue to invest, build and collaborate with global players to achieve the highest reliability, efficiency and economies to deliver high- quality, reliable power at affordable prices to our customers both in India and markets worldwide,  he added.REC was owned by the China National Bluestar (Group) Co Ltd.Earlier this year in June during the company's 44th annual general meeting (AGM), chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani had said that Reliance will invest $10 billion dollars in sustainable energy, a pivot from the traditional oil and chemicals business that relies on fossil fuels.According to industry estimates, before the pandemic, REC reached almost 10% market share in the rooftop commercial and industrial segment.REC, a 25-year old company, has patented over 600 utilities that produce high-efficiency solar panels. The company has two manufacturing units in Norway that produces polysilicon, and an additional facility in Singapore that assembles cells and modules.Reliance said it would support REC's expansion plans that include upscaling the Singapore factory to 2-3 GW, and constructing two new units \u2014 2 GW cell and module unit in France, and a 1 GW module plant in the US.",

        "articleBody": "Having achieved the initial target of 25 Giga Watt renewable portfolio four years ahead of schedule, the Adani Group now plans to triple its solar power generation capacity in the next four years. Speaking at the inaugural session of the 'TiE Sustainability Summit 2021' themed,  Where entrepreneurship meets sustainability , Gautam Adani said over the next decade, his group would invest over USD 20 billion in renewable energy generation.  While these scenarios emerge, the Adani Group is not sitting still. We are tripling our solar power generation capacity over the next four years. This is a rate of growth currently unmatched by any other company anywhere on the planet,  he said in his address. The overall investments, both organic and inorganic, across the entire green energy value chain would range between USD 50 and USD 70 billion. This would include investments with potential partners for electrolyzer manufacturing, backward integrations to secure the supply chain for solar and wind generation businesses, and AI-based industrial cloud platforms, he said.  Our renewables portfolio has reached the initial target of 25 GW a full four years ahead of schedule. Today, we are already the world's largest solar power player. This puts us well on track to be the world's largest renewable power generating company by 2030,  Adani further said. According to him, the revolution in alternative energy technologies throws open the possibility of India someday becoming a net green energy exporter even as Hydrogen and its derivatives can replace a significant amount of the country's imports of crude oil, natural gas and coal.

Under the existing regime, 70% of the gross value of the contract was considered for the supply of goods, attracting a 5% rate. This will now be 12%.Experts said the increase will negatively affect the growth of the renewable energy sector.  Instead of providing the mechanism to allow refund of unutilized credit on input services and capital goods, the government has increased the GST rate on output supplies which will put additional burden in the hands of consumers,  said Tushar Aggarwal, founder partner at Tattvam Advisors.The rate change will create transitional issues for ongoing renewable energy projects, he added.Carbonated beverages of fruit drink or carbonated beverages with fruit juice will attract 28% GST along with a 12% cess, while tax on copper concentrates and other metals has been increased to 18% from 5% currently.A lower rate of 5% will be applicable on remdesivir, anticoagulants such as heparin, itolizumab, posaconazole, infliximab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, casirivimab, imdevimab, 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose and favipiravir until December 31.",

        "articleBody": "India is likely to make a proposal for a global solar power grid to address climate change goals at the upcoming COP26 negotiations. It also proposes to announce a major jump in its renewable energy target, closer to 450GW.The plan, called 'One Sun, One World, One Grid' (Osowog) - a transnational solar power grid - will be projected as a game changer to help meet climate change goals. ET has gathered that high level discussions are on regarding the proposal. The fundamental concept behind Osowog is to develop a transnational grid that will be laid all over the globe to transmit solar power generated across the globe to different load centres. It would thus help in realising the vision of 'One Sun, One World, One Grid' articulated by India,  said the New Delhi-housed International Solar Alliance (ISA) in a November 2020 statement.As a Quad member, India has already supported an increase in nationally determined contributions and 450 GW renewable energy target and Osowog could be crucial to meeting the target. India has also begun discussions with several other nations to build consensus on Osowog as a global strategy.The initiative is led by the ISA, the Indian government and the World Bank, which have signed a MoU for developing a long-term vision, implementation plan, road map and institutional framework for implementing the initiative. There is already interest in the idea.An ISA statement last November said current levels of climate ambitions on renewable energy were not adequate to meet mitigation targets, and the net zero goal by 2050, but an 'intercontinental grid' like Osowog could help bridge the gap through 'increased deployment and trading of renewable energy'.At the first plenary of Osowog organised along with the third ISA assembly, member nations and the United Kingdom identified Osowog and World Solar Bank as two key deliverables for COP26. British minister and COP26 president Alok Sharma also offered UK's support to ISA secretariat for implementing Osowog.The seeds for the 'One Sun One World One Grid' (OSOWOG)\u2019 were sown in 2018 when Prime Minister Modi addressed the First Assembly of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and had called for connecting solar energy supply across borders.The main thought was that \u2018The Sun Never Sets\u2019 and is a constant at some geographical location, globally, at any given point of time and this allows for large-scale solar generation capacity in various regions.\u201c The fundamental concept behind OSOWOG is to develop a trans-national grid that will be laid all over the globe to transport the solar power generated across the globe to different load centres. It would thus help in realizing the vision of \u201cOne Sun, One World, One Grid\u201d articulated by India\u201d, explains the International Solar Alliance.It is envisaged that OSOWOG will be implemented in three phases. In the first Phase, the Indian Grid interconnects with the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia grids to share solar and other renewable energy resources for meeting electricity needs including during peak demand. It is then interconnected with the African power pools in the second Phase and the third phase would vie for global interconnection of the power transmission grid to achieve the One Sun One World One Grid\u2019s vision.OSOWOG and its implementation could be a major political statement by India, if it wins global approval.The jury is still out on the net zero commitment. The Indian government is amid hectic calculations on the cost to the Indian economy and the funding it will require to achieve higher climate goals including net zero.  India is likely to link its ability to enhance its climate targets to the availability of global green funding, ET has reported last week.",

        "articleBody": "Virescent Renewable Energy Trust (VRET), India\u2019s first renewable energy infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) set up by KKR-sponsored Virescent Infrastructure, has raised Rs 460 crore from Canadian fund Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo) and other investors. This is the debut deal in India for AIMCo, one of Canada\u2019s largest and most diversified institutional investment managers with more than $98 billion of assets under management (AUM) as of June 30, 2021. Global investment firm KKR entered into the Indian renewable energy space in October last year when it set up Virescent with plans to acquire operating renewable energy assets in India. KKR is investing in the clean energy InvIT from its Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors Fund.\u201cInvesting in VRET alongside AIMCo and other institutional investors will help us to capitalise on this huge market opportunity,\u201d said Hardik Shah, managing director of KKR Infrastructure. \u201cWe will continue to support Virescent and its management team in providing greater renewable energy solutions to communities across India.\u201d VRET\u2019s initial portfolio comprises nine operational solar projects, with an aggregated capacity of approximately 395 MW. The assets are located in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. In addition, subject to applicable approvals, VRET is in advanced discussions to acquire a 55MW portfolio from Focal Energy.\u201cVRET\u2019s portfolio of operating renewable energy assets whose economics are underpinned by long-term power purchase agreements are well aligned with our clients\u2019 investment objectives,\u201d said Ahmed Mubashir, director, infrastructure and renewable resources, at AIMCo that invests on behalf of 32 pension, endowment and government funds in the province of Alberta.Axis Capital acted as the lead manager to the issue.According to Crisil rating, Virescent has a healthy revenue visibility due to long-term power purchase agreements at predetermined tariffs, in addition to its track record of enhanced generation capabilities, its healthy financial risk profile, and its expectation of low leverage.Virescent\u2019s low leverage has resulted in a healthy debt service coverage ratio over its entire debt tenure, supported by adequate liquidity, Crisil said.\u201cWe look forward to drawing on the global investment management expertise of our investors as we continue to acquire high-quality assets for achieving our initial growth targets,\u201d said Sanjay Grewal, CEO of Virescent Infrastructure. \u201cOur endeavour is to support the government in achieving its medium and long-term renewable energy objectives of 175 GW and 450 GW respectively.\u201d In May, Virescent had acquired 76 MW of India solar assets of Singapore-based Sindicatum Renewable Energy. Last year, KKR had acquired five solar energy assets from Shapoorji Pallonji Group with a capacity of 169 MW in Maharashtra and 148 MW in Tamil Nadu. ",

This is the first ground mounted solar project of NCL for which project consultant NTPC has invited bids with a pre-bid date set on October 7 and tender opening date on October 22, Coal India (CIL) said in a statement.   In a bid to promote green energy, Coal India Limited arm Northern Coalfields Limited has joined hands with NTPC to install a 50 MW solar power project at Nigahi coal mines of NCL in Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh,  the statement said.  CIL NTPC Urja Pvt Ltd (CNUPL), a joint venture of Coal India Ltd and NTPC, which will co-ordinate for this entire project, is confident that the project would be completed within the stipulated timeframe of one year.  As a project consultant, NTPC will help NCL get successful bidder for this project and then NCL will get the project executed through the successful bidder.  With availability of land and not much work on transmission line construction, this solar project is an attractive proposition for NCL and the company itself will use the power produced through this project.  Notably, CIL has planned to produce 3,000 megawatts of solar power by 2023-24 and become a net-zero company.  This NCL project would supplement to the efforts of the CIL in achieving this goal. CIL accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.",

The government only has capacity for 10 GW.   86397218The companies have divided the bids up in four stages of the manufacturing process: polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules. At present, India's existing 15 GW production capacity has no polysilicon or wafer production capacity.Adani, Reliance, Jindal, First Solar, and Andhra Pradesh-based Shirdi Sai Electricals have bid for the entire value chain's integration as part of their tenders.CIL, CubicPV, L&T, and ReNew have applied for wafer and onwards, while the rest of the nine names on the list that include Indian players such as Tata, Vikram, Waaree, Acme, and Avaada will only look at cells and modules, per IREDA's list.Manufacturing companies import wafers or cells from abroad, mainly China, and then assemble them into cells and modules respectively. Nearly 95% of solar equipment used in projects in India is imported from China or Chinese-origin companies.To prevent the industry's dependence on China, the government has also constituted a basic customs duty (BCD) tax on solar imports. It will be charged at 25% for cells and 40% for modules, and will be applicable from April, 2022.Earlier this year in April, the union cabinet had approved the PLI scheme for manufacturing high efficiency solar photovoltaic modules with a Rs 4,500 crore outlay. The incentives are expected to bring direct investment of around Rs 17,200 crore in solar PV manufacturing.",

        "articleBody": "Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL), a subsidiary of Coal India, has commissioned a 250-kilowatt (kW) rooftop solar power project, ramping up its total installed solar rooftop capacity to 692 kW, according to a statement. The project was commissioned on Wednesday, Coal India Ltd (CIL) said in a statement.   ECL, the West Bengal-located coal-producing subsidiary of Coal India Ltd, commissioned a 250-kW rooftop solar power project on Wednesday ramping up its total installed solar roof top capacity to 692 kW,  the statement said.  The implemented through the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), the newly installed 250 kW plant set up at ECL's headquarters in Sanctoria for captive consumption, has an average generation of 3.65 lakh units per annum.  This is sufficient to meet 12 per cent of the entire average annual power consumption of ECL's headquarters which is 30 lakh units.  The project cost is Rs 65 lakh, excluding SECI's incentive.  The previously installed 442 kW capacity rooftop solar power projects are spread across ECL for consumption in hospitals, area offices and guest houses.  Average annual generation from these solar projects is 6.45 lakh units.  With installation of the recent project, ECL's total solar generation has jumped to 10.10 lakh units.   Apart from bringing down the power consumption bill, what is important is the carbon-dioxide reduction leading to better environment. With the implementation of the 250-kW solar plant, the estimated reduction in CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission is almost 300 tonnes per year.   Combined with the company's already existing 442 kW solar power projects, the total CO2 reduction will be to the tune of 830 tonnes per year,  the company said.  ECL Chairman and Managing Director Prem Sagar Mishra inaugurated the project, along with the directors of the company.  Solar power generation lists high on priority of CIL's diversification portfolio where the company would be infusing much of its own investment.  CIL is serious in its intent to pursue solar power generation as an alternative green energy source and has laid out plans to install 3,000 megawatt (mW) solar power by 2024.  The company is developing necessary in-house expertise and has created a team of competent officers for its solar power initiatives.",

Located at NTPC Simhadri in Andhra Pradesh, the 25-megawatt floating SPV project covers an area of 100 acres, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) said without disclosing the project cost.  BHEL has successfully commissioned India's largest Floating Solar PV plant. Notably, with its unique state-of-the-art design, the project is an engineering marvel, created by BHEL,  the company said in a statement. BHEL said its scope of work in the project included design, engineering, procurement and construction of the solar project, which has been executed by the company's recently formed Solar Business Division. The project will help saving valuable land resources and conserving water by reducing evaporation, it said. It further said this complex module array has been designed for the first time in India to withstand gusts of wind up to 180 km/hr. Given the coastal location of the project site that leads to severe corrosion, all the platform structures and other equipment have been made corrosion resistant, it added. The engineering firm is the leading EPC player in the solar industry in India, with an overall portfolio of more than 1.2 gigawatts. Its portfolio of floating solar PV projects is also the largest in the country, with more than 45 MW projects commissioned and around 107 MW under execution. The company offers EPC solutions for both grid-interactive and off-grid, ground-mounted, rooftop, floating and canal top solar plants.",

        "articleBody": "The GST fitment committee's recommendation to raise the tax on solar modules from 5% to 12% has sent shockwaves across the renewable energy industry, as companies are worried that it would make a lot of projects unviable.Currently, the GST rate on all solar panels is 5%. This was decided when the indirect tax system was overhauled in 2017. A straight 12% GST for the solar industry will prove to be a catastrophic decision for a huge segment in the renewable energy industry,  said a top executive from a leading solar power developer. Not only will it throw yet another spanner in the works of upcoming projects, EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) firms will bear the worst brunt of this decision,  the person added.The National Solar Energy Federation of India, an industry body that represents the interests of renewable energy developers, has written to the Ministry of Finance seeking relief.  At this juncture, if they are asked to pay for the additional GST, the repercussions would be unimaginable, and the industry could derail given the negative market sentiments continuing to prevail amid the turmoil this industry is already facing,  the federation said in its letter.While existing large-scale utility projects that have been bid out by the Centre's nodal bodies are likely to get an exemption because of a change-in-law provision, private projects for open access and commercial and industrial consumers would have to pay the hiked tax rate.The GST Council will meet on Friday to decide on the matter. Other items up for discussion are oncology medicines, rubber products and household electronics.Solar imports enjoy an import duty-free period till April 2022. After that, a basic customs duty of 40% on solar modules and 25% on solar cells will be charged on imports. Maybe this is the government's way of plugging in the gap on the tax holiday that the developers are taking advantage of till next year. But such a massive increase in taxes will negatively affect the domestic players as well,  said an executive from an Indian manufacturer, requesting anonymity.",

        "articleBody": "Solar energy has the potential to supply up to 40% of the nation's electricity within 15 years \u2014 a 10-fold increase over current solar output, but one that would require massive changes in U.S. policy and billions of dollars in federal investment to modernize the nation's electric grid, a new federal report says.The report by the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy says the United States would need to quadruple its annual solar capacity \u2014 and continue to increase it year by year \u2014 as it shifts to a renewable-dominant grid in order to address the existential threat posed by climate change.The report released Wednesday is not intended as a policy statement or administration goal, officials said. Instead, it is  designed to guide and inspire the next decade of solar innovation by helping us answer questions like: How fast does solar need to increase capacity and to what level?'' said Becca Jones-Albertus, director of the Energy Department's solar energy technologies office.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement that the study \u201cilluminates the fact that solar, our cheapest and fastest-growing source of clean energy, could produce enough electricity to power all of the homes in the U.S. by 2035 and employ as many as 1.5 million people in the process.\u201d The report comes after President Joe Biden declared climate change has become \u201ceverybody's crisis \u201d during a visit to neighborhoods flooded by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. Biden warned Tuesday that it's time for America to get serious about the \u201ccode red\u201d danger posed by climate change or face increasing loss of life and property.\u201cWe can't turn it back very much, but we can prevent it from getting worse,\u201d Biden said before touring a New Jersey neighborhood ravaged by severe flooding caused by Ida. \u201cWe don't have any more time.\u201dThe natural disaster has given Biden an opening to push Congress to approve his plan to spend $1 trillion to fortify infrastructure nationwide, including electrical grids, water and sewer systems, to better defend against extreme weather. The legislation has cleared the Senate and awaits a House vote.The U.S. installed a record 15 gigawatts of solar generating capacity in 2020, and solar now represents just over 3% of the current electricity supply, the Energy Department said.The \u201cSolar Futures Study,\u201d prepared by DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, shows that, by 2035, the country would need to quadruple its yearly solar capacity additions and provide 1,000 gigawatts of power to a renewable-dominant grid. By 2050, solar energy could provide 1,600 gigawatts on a zero-carbon grid \u2014 producing more electricity than consumed in all residential and commercial buildings in the country today, the report said. Decarbonizing the entire energy system could result in as much as 3,000 gigawatts of solar by 2050 due to increased electrification in the transportation, buildings, and industrial sectors, the report said.The report assumes that clean-energy policies currently being debated in Congress will drive a 95% reduction from 2005 levels in the grid's carbon dioxide emissions by 2035, and a 100% reduction by 2050.But even without aggressive action from Congress \u2014 an outcome that is far from certain in an evenly divided House and Senate \u2014 installed solar capacity could still see a seven-fold increase by 2050, relative to 2005, the report said.\u201cEven without a concerted policy effort, market forces and technology advances will drive significant deployment of solar and other clean energy technologies as well as substantial decarbonization,'' the report said, citing falling costs for solar panels and other factors.To achieve 40% solar power by 2035, the U.S. must install an average of 30 gigawatts of solar capacity per year between now and 2025 \u2014 double its current rate \u2014 and 60 gigawatts per year from 2025 to 2030, the report said.Those goals far exceed what even the solar industry has been pushing for as the Biden administration and Congress debate climate and clean-energy legislation. The Solar Energy Industries Association has urged a framework for solar to achieve 20% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030.Abigail Ross Hopper, the group's president and CEO, said the DOE study \u201cmakes it clear that we will not achieve the levels of decarbonization that we need without significant policy advances.'' The solar group sent a letter to Congress Wednesday from nearly 750 companies spelling out recommended policy changes.  We believe with those policies and a determined private sector, the Biden administration's goals are definitely achievable,'' Hopper said.",

        "articleBody": "Shapoorji Pallonji-backed Sterling and Wilson Solar is said to be in sale talks with bulge-bracket private equity funds including Canadian funds such as Brookfield and CPPIB as well as Indian conglomerates such as Adani Group and Reliance Industries, hoping to reap the benefits of increased interest in renewable energy in the country.Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. Pvt. Ltd (SPCPL) and Khurshed Yazdi Daruvala, promoter-shareholders of Sterling and Wilson Solar, are exploring options to cede control of the entity as they look to settle outstanding debt and use the remaining funds for other businesses, people with knowledge of the matter told ET.\u201cThey have sold some of the individual operational assets in the past. Now, the SP (Shapoorji Pallonji) Group as well as Daruvala family are exploring to sell the entire entity,\u201d said one of them.SPCPL has already agreed to divest its Sterling and Wilson Solar stake under a one-time restructuring (OTR) plan.\u201cThe company could sell its entire stake or offer a majority stake to the buyer,\u201d said an executive close to the SP Group. It has sold operational solar assets in the past to companies including Adani.Shapoorji Pallonji owned 50.6% of Sterling and Wilson Solar, Daruvala had 17.9% and the rest was held by the public at the end of FY21. The stock has gained 49% in the past six months, closing at Rs 348.05 on Tuesday, up 6.47%. That values the promoter holding at Rs 3,795.08 crore.In March, the Reserve Bank of India-appointed KV Kamath committee approved a one-time restructuring package for SPCPL\u2019s Rs 10,900 crore debt under the Covid-19 relief framework. SPCPL is the holding company of the 150-year-old SP Group. Under this plan, the group didn\u2019t have to pay interest for a year and no principal for two years, giving it time for disinvestments. The group expects debt to be cut to Rs 3,000-4,000 crore at the end of the year.Sterling and Wilson Solar, Brookfield, CPPIB and Reliance declined to comment. There was no response from Adani Group.Started as a solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) division in 2011, Sterling and Wilson Solar was demerged on April 1, 2017, and listed in August 2019. The company has a portfolio of 257 solar power projects with an aggregate capacity of 11.4 GW across geographies and is considered one of the leading solar EPC solutions providers in the world. It has a presence in 26 countries, with the Middle East and Australia contributing a major part of revenue.At the end of FY21, an SP Group entity sold two special purpose vehicles (SPVs) having an enterprise value of Rs 446 crore and infused about Rs 250 crore toward repayment of inter-corporate debentures (ICDs). Outstanding ICDs at the end of May 2021 stood at Rs 740 crore, India Ratings said in a note in June.\u201cThe group entity is planning to monetise the remaining fourth and fifth assets and expects to recover the ICDs completely by end-September 2021 to improve the credit profile,\u201d the rating agency said. \u201cInd-Ra in its base case had already factored the recovery proceeds of ICDs from the sale of the third asset and thus any delay in the same may be negative for the ratings.\u201dThis deal has the potential to reduce SP Group's debt by a great margin, said Pankaj Bisht, managing partner at Connesso Consulting LLP, a consulting firm based in Delhi.\u201cThis is also crucial due to the ongoing sentiments around renewable energy sector in India,\u201d he said. \u201cEPC is traditionally a complex business with the challenges associated with it. With the investor's enthusiasm in renewable energy sector, the allied sectors like EPC, solar panel manufacturing are set to grow and can give better valuations to the sellers.\u201dAmong potential investors, Reliance Industries has already announced big plans to enter green energy. Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced investments worth Rs75,000 crore over the next three years at the company\u2019s annual general meeting in June. Adani Green has one of the largest global renewable portfolios with locked-in growth of up to 24.3 GW including operating, under-construction, awarded, and L1 bid projects.Canadian alternate asset manager Brookfield and pension money manager CPPIB are among aggressive investors in Indian alternate energy assets. Brookfield has acquired four wind and solar energy assets, while CPPIB has invested $600 million in an alternate energy InVit with the Piramal Group. ",

        "articleBody": "Direct supply of solar energy to Indian Railways will enable two billion passengers to travel on solar powered trains and help save almost seven millions tonnes of carbon a year, according to a study. The study conducted by NGO Climate Trends and UK-based green tech start-up Riding Sunbeams said direct supply of solar energy to Indian Railway lines - without the need to connect via the grid - will power at least one in four trains on the national network on competitive terms.  According to the Indian Railways 2019-20 annual report, there was passenger traffic of over eight billion during that period, which would mean that two billion passengers could be travelling on trains directly powered by solar energy,  said the study.  One million is equal to ten lakhs. The study said that a mix of electrification, energy efficiency and a switch to renewable energy will be needed to enable the target set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Indian Railways to be a net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. The new analysis highlights that around a quarter of this new solar capacity - up to 5,272 MW - could be fed directly into the railway's overhead lines instead of being procured over the electricity networks, reducing energy losses and saving money for the rail operator. The researchers found that substituting energy supplied from the coal-dominated grid for private-wire supply from solar could also rapidly cut emissions by as much as 6.8 million tonnes carbon dioxide each year. Report co-author and Riding Sunbeams founder and director of innovation Leo Murray said,  Right now India is leading the world on two vital climate frontiers - rail electrification and solar power deployment. Our analysis shows that connecting these two keystone low-carbon technologies together in Indian Railways can drive both India's economic recovery from the Covid pandemic and its efforts to transition off fossil fuels to tackle the climate crisis.  Another author of the report and Director at Climate Trends Aarti Khosla noted that the government pumps large sums of money to modernise the railways.  Indian Railways plays an important role in the lives of every Indian. Not only is it the most practical mode of transportation, it is also the most famous and the largest employer in the country. The government pumps large sums of money to modernise the railways, which, in turn, will play a large role in a net zero vision of the nation.  There has been analysis that converting all diesel locomotives to electric will indeed increase the emissions in the short term, however, this report shows the tremendous opportunity of doing it right the first time, by creating a direct connection of the locomotive system to solar PV installations, meeting more than a quarter of the total demand,  Khosla said. The researchers also warned that achieving the target of full electrification of all routes by 2023 could be accompanied by an increase in CO2 emissions in the short term because of India's current reliance on coal to produce electricity. The team analysed the traction energy demand on each of India's railway zones and matched this with the potential solar resource in each region to produce a figure for the total amount of solar energy that could be connected directly to the railway to run trains, the study said. The top five zones with the greatest solar-to-rail potential found in the study were South Central Railway (394-625MW) which serves Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Pondicherry; Central Railway (299-475MW) in Maharashtra; Northern Railway (290-459MW) in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi; Western Railway (280-443MW) in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and; West Central Railway (278-440MW) serving Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and some areas in Uttar Pradesh.  The calculations assume that all of the energy generated by the solar is used by the railway, and do not include the potential for battery storage integration. Factoring in lower utilization rates and storage could boost solar-to-rail potential to over 40 per cent of Indian Railways' traction energy demand,  the study said. It explored how strategic investment in dedicated freight corridors and new high speed routes can support Indian Railways to boost passengers and freight traffic, and the key role this can play in achieving India's national climate change commitments.",

The company closed FY21 with a topline of Rs 930 crore, which was nearly three times its previous year revenue. Of the past year revenue, Rs 560 crore came in from solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business (setting up the full unit) and Rs 180 crore from exports, Dinesh Patidar, chairman and managing director of Shakti Pumps has said.  Shakti Pumps, which has manufactured the country's first BEE 5 star-rated pumps and is also the first domestic company to produce 100 per cent stainless steel pumps and energy efficient motors, was founded in 1982 in Pithampur, near Indore.  At present, its products reach as much 125 world markets. The company has filed for 20 patents since it pioneered the solar water pumps in 2010.  Other key players in the solar water pump market include Alpex Solar, Bright Solar, Claro Energy, Conergy Energy, Tata Power Solar Systems, Lorentz, Greenmax Technology, and Udhaya Semiconductors and so on.  Shakti Pumps has two plants in Pitampur with a cumulative production capacity (solar and motorised) of 5 lakh units per annum in two shifts and 3.5 lakh units in single shift. Its special economic zone (SEZ) unit near-by can produce 1.5 lakh units per annum.  We expect robust demand for solar water pumps this year as there is increasing awareness about the huge financial benefits from them and the good monsoons giving them enough liquidity, Patidar said.   Accordingly, FY22 revenue should more than double to Rs 2,000 crore. The export front also looks promising as we just bagged a Rs 250-crore order from Uganda. This should help us net Rs 500 crore from exports this fiscal year,  Patidar told PTI on Wednesday, adding and earn around Rs 75 crore in net income.  The entry into southern markets, especially Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu should also boost volumes, he said.  Shakti Pumps has installed over 1 lakh solar pumps out of (1.2 lakh installed) since it entered the segment in 2010 and in FY21 it had installed 20,000 units under the EPC model (setting up the solar water pump unit along with the solar power panel units) and 15,000 units were sold to others who install such pumps across.  Its main markets are Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, MP and Chhattisgrah, while Andhra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu are the new growth markets in a year or two from now, Patidar said.  Shakti Pumps has over 260 pump models and over 1,000 stock-keeping unit (SKUs) with their capacity ranging from 300 watts to 300 kilo watts.  On average, a solar pump unit costs around Rs 2.15 lakh and goes up depending on the wattage and load capacity.  It procures solar units from the Adani Group, he said.  Patidar expects significant volume growth over the next two years due to increasing application in domestic and agriculture sectors, rising government support (central subsidy of 30 per cent and states offering up to 65 per cent), and low maintenance cost.  Maharashtra is significantly contributing to the market growth offering up to 95 per cent in capital subsidy to farmers, he said.  The centre has set a target to install 1 million solar water pumps by 2021 for irrigation and drinking water purposes. According to him, a farmer/user can recover the entire cost within a year.  Shakti Pump shares were trading over 1 per cent lower against their previous close on BSE at Rs 708.70 apiece in afternoon trade.",

        "articleBody": "Solar capacity addition in India jumped over 12-fold to 2,488 megawatt (MW) during April-June period of 2021 as compared to the year-ago period, according to Mercom India Research. The solar capacity addition in the quarter under review was 19 per cent higher when compared to 2,090 MW installed in January-March (Q1) 2021, the research firm said in its report titled 'Q2 2021 India Solar Market Update'.   India added 2,488 MW of solar in the second quarter or Q2 of the calendar year 2021. The installations were up 1,114 per cent year-over-year compared to 205 MW added in Q2 2020 when COVID crippled the sector,  it said.  Solar capacity addition in the period under review is the highest in a quarter since Q2 of 2018, the report said.       In January-June 2021, India added 4,578 MW (approximately 4.5 GW) of solar, a 251 per cent increase compared to the same period of last year.      Installations exceeded 3.2 GW (gigawatts) of solar installed in all of calender year 2020.      Installations were significantly higher than the previous quarter's despite various state level lockdowns due to COVID, the report said.     Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group said even with a strong quarter, the industry continues to battle uncertainties around higher component costs and logistics issues. With duties and import restrictions, purchasing quality solar components at the best price will be the biggest challenge for the industry.  He further said the demand for building large-scale projects is extremely high, while auctions have slowed down. The government focus has shifted towards building domestic manufacturing capacities. According to the report, at the end of June quarter 2021, cumulative solar installations reached 43.6 GW.  India's large-scale solar project development pipeline stands at 52.8 GW, along with 28 GW of projects tendered and pending auction at the end of Q2 2021.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries (RIL) is close to acquiring REC Group, the largest solar panel manufacturer in Europe, for $1-1.2 billion from China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina), said people aware of the matter. The purchase will help RIL access cutting-edge technology and global manufacturing capabilities as it continues with its recently-announced march into green energy, they said. Reliance is in talks with global banks to raise $500-600 million in acquisition financing for the transaction, while the rest will be funded via equity. Singapore-registered and Norway-headquartered REC Group is an international \u201cmember\u201d of state-owned chemicals giant ChemChina, which is the largest shareholder in Pirelli Tyres and Syngenta. REC produces silicon material for photovoltaic (PV) applications and multi-crystalline wafers, as well as solar cells and modules for rooftop installations, industrial and solar parks.The solar industry\u2019s growing dependence on China has become a bone of contention globally and leading consumers such as India and the US are now incentivising local manufacturing or diversifying supply sources.  Move to Boost Capabilities In 2019, when solar ranked as the world\u2019s top source of new power-generating capacity, about one-third of the polysilicon the industry used to make solar panels came from Xinjiang province, according to Bernreuter Research. Indian companies such as Renew Power and conglomerates Adani and Reliance have all announced major manufacturing projects now.       85784964 India\u2019s current solar cell-making capacity is at around 3 GW a year \u2014 the module production capacity is around five times that \u2013 but is not enough to meet the solar target of 280 GW. Due diligence is almost complete and bilateral negotiations are on to close the transaction. A formal announcement is expected in a few weeks, said the people mentioned above. \u201cEarlier, Reliance has been scoping several independent power producer assets, including SB Energy, but valuations made them baulk at most of those transactions,\u201d said one of the persons. \u201cUnlike the past, they now have a clear idea of the path and so are far more focused. It\u2019s unlikely they want to be a developer feeding to the grid or distribution companies in India. It\u2019s more a manufacturing play to complement the Prime Minister\u2019s energy self-reliance narrative.\u201d The company is working with a global adviser on the transaction. Reliance declined to comment. REC Group didn\u2019t respond to queries. \u201cManufacturing is super competitive. Next year, there will be oversupply from China. Only players like Reliance can make these assets sweat,\u201d said the chief executive of a power producer. Mint had earlier reported that RIL is evaluating REC. With an annual volume of 1.5 GW, REC has made over 40 million solar panels, which generated 11 GW of power globally for customers \u2014 from Ikea and Audi to Tiger Beer and homeowners in Arizona \u2014 to become one of the largest vendors globally, with manufacturing in Scandinavia and Singapore. Formed in 1996, the history of REC Group is one of ups and downs and multiple corporate reorganisations and amalgamations. After a successful IPO in early 2000, its plants and operations had to shut in 2011-12 due to weak market conditions and negative cash flows.In 2013, REC was split and offshoot Renewable Energy Corporation ASA (REC Silicon) was formed, consisting of the silicon manufacturing facilities in the US. In 2014, China National Bluestar agreed to acquire REC Solar for $640 million to combine it with a Norwegian asset \u2013 solar grade silicon maker Elkem \u2013 it picked up in 2011. Bluestar in 2011 had bought Elkem for $2 billion in one of the biggest industrial takeovers by a Chinese group in Europe.In India, the company has been present for a little over a decade. After starting out as a supplier \u2014 to power utilities such as Greenko or scaled projects for the Department of Atomic Energy and Eenadu Group, among others \u2014 it pivoted to the rooftop segment for industrial users such as Capgemini, Infosys, BMW and Wonder Cements, among others. According to industry estimates, before the pandemic, REC reached almost 10% market share in the rooftop commercial and industrial segment. Over the past few quarters, REC has been marketing its HJT technology panels in India to potential customers. The company says these have an efficiency of 25% against 15-18% offered by utility scale manufacturers, albeit at a cheaper price. \u201cREC doesn\u2019t compete with utility scale players such as Longi, Jinko, or Trina in the Indian market,\u201d said an executive at a rival.Energy for FutureReliance chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani announced ambitious green energy plans with the setting up of the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar, at the company\u2019s 44th annual general meeting in June. With a $10-billion investment, the company plans four giga factories \u2014 an integrated solar PV plant, advanced energy storage battery manufacturing unit, green hydrogen, and fuel cell facility.Reliance has already begun making moonshot bets on new energy and materials. Wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd, along with strategic investors Paulson & Co Inc and Bill Gates, announced an investment of $144 million in Ambri Inc, an energy storage company based in Massachusetts. Last year, Reliance had partnered with Gates to back Breakthrough Ventures to support innovation in clean energy solutions.",

        "articleBody": "The Centre's showstopper solar power project in Ladakh can't seem to catch a break.The government announced a raise in the capacity of the proposed mega solar power project to 10,000 MW along with a 5,000 MW battery storage and 3,000 MW wind farm, even when the initial plan continues to stumble over land issues. Every time a parcel is finalised, some new issue is raised,  a source aware of the developments told TOI. In the latest instance, presence of a water body was  discovered  in the parcel of land in the Pang area after it was finalised on the basis of satellite mapping.The original blueprint included a photo-voltaic set up of 7,500 MW capacity split in roughly 70:30 ratio between Leh and Kargil districts, respectively. But the topography of Zanskar region of Kargil, where a packet of 2,500 MW was to be built, was found unsuitable for the transmission line. After which, the whole project was shifted to Leh, with packets of 5,000 MW each in Hanle-Khaldo and Pang regions.Battery storage was added to the revised plan to eliminate the need for two 900-Km transmission lines for accommodating the additional capacity, instead of a single line in the original plan.  During the day, part of the solar power will be used to charge the batteries, which will feed the northern grid during evening peak hours. This will save transmission costs,  power and renewable energy minister R K Singh told TOI.Even with the original specification, the project was comparable to the largest in the world. The revised configuration will make it unique and raise the investment potential far beyond Rs 45,000 crore estimated earlier. In March, a committee was tasked with identifying encumbrance-free land and submit its report within a month. About 25,000 acres of land in the Hanle-Khaldo region was initially designated for the Leh part of the project. It has now been reduced to 20,000 acres after objections by the wildlife department. Villagers have expressed concerns over loss of grazing ground, though they are not opposed to the project. In Pang area, 185 km southeast from Leh along the road to Manali, 22,000 acres of non-grazing ground was identified. But this too has fallen foul over the presence of a water body and SECI has been asked to apply afresh for alternative land, the report said.",

In a statement, the company said pumps of 7.5 horse power (HP) and 10 HP capacity have been installed for farmers in the state to reduce their dependence on diesel-based generators.  Gautam Solar Managing Director Gautam Mohanka said,  So far, we've worked with the farmers of Haryana and Rajasthan, who have shown great interest in the new solar technologies and have embraced the change wholeheartedly.   We look forward to working with farmers in the other regions of the country as well and help them in their noble pursuit by gearing them with clean, efficient, and cost-effective irrigation equipment.   The PM Kusum Yojana was launched by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in 2019 to provide subsidies on solar pumps to farmers.  Under this scheme, farmers have to bear 40 per cent of the pump's cost, while the central and state governments subsidize the remaining 60 per cent for solar pumps that have a capacity of up to 10 HP.  However, Haryana and some other states have provided additional top-up on the subsidies, which has reduced the farmer's share to less than 25 per cent.  Delhi-based Gautam Solar produces solar pump components and other solar products.",

It will generate enough electricity to power 7,000 homes using more than a lakh solar PV modules.The initiative will save 46,000 tonnes of CO2 and 1,364 million litres of water each year, enough to cover the needs of 6,700 homes for a whole year.The Simhadri Station is now also the first of its kind to be equipped with an open-sea intake from the Bay of Bengal, which has been functional for more than 20 years.The floating solar facility is part of the coal-burning giant's aim to become green by 2032, when it plans to build a 60-gigawatt renewable energy capacity. It's also the first solar project under the power ministry's 2018 'flexibilisation' policy, which allows producers to supply power from any of their sources dependent on plant efficiency, lowering discoms' costs.NTPC is also constructing a 100 MW floating solar power plant on the reservoir of its Ramagundam thermal power plant in Tamil Nadu.",

He further informed that the tentative cost of construction and development of this project is Rs 1,000 crore.  The project is expected to generate 420.48 MU (million units) in the 1st year and the project cumulative energy generation over a period of 25 years would be about 10,512 MU.  The PPA shall be signed between BREDA and SJVN for 25 years.  Sharma also told that presently, SJVN has a total installed capacity of 2,016.5 MW which includes two hydro power plants of 1,912 MW and four renewable power plants of 104.5 MW (two solar plants of 6.9 MW and 2 wind plants of 97.6 MW).  Earlier, SJVN bagged two solar projects totalling 145 MW in the state of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Both these solar projects have also been bagged through open competitive bidding.  With this recent allotment of 200 MW, SJVN now has 345 MW of solar projects under execution.  He stated that all these solar projects are scheduled to be commissioned by March 2022, which shall be a gigantic leap for SJVN's renewable capacity.  The Government of India has envisaged the vision of Power to All 24X7 and has set a target of 175 GW of renewables, out of which 100 GW is to be met through solar by 2022.  In September last year at the United Nations Climate Action Summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced increasing the renewable energy target to 450 GW by 2030 from 175 GW by 2022.  In line with the target set by the Government of India, SJVN has set its shared vision of capacity addition of 5,000 MW by 2023, 12,000 MW by 2030 and 25,000 MW by 2040.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s ACME Solar Holdings Pvt. is seeking partners to help fund a plan to more than triple its solar generation capacity.The company, which in 2018 aborted a public listing because of stock market turbulence and uncertainty over the nation\u2019s energy policy, plans to expand its solar capacity to 10 gigawatts over the next five years at a cost of 200 billion rupees ($2.7 billion), the company\u2019s founder and chairman Manoj K. Upadhyay said in an interview.ACME currently has 2.9 gigawatts of operating capacity with a further 2 gigawatts already funded and nearing completion, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a capital intensive business, so we will try to have as many partners as we can,\u201d Upadhyay said. \u201cThis will help us unlock capital for our new projects and prove what we\u2019re building has value.\u201dThe firm is counting on India\u2019s growing appeal as a renewable power market, with the world\u2019s third-biggest emitter seeking to roll out a record amount of solar and wind over the next decade and move away from fossil fuels. It is seeking to raise about a quarter of the total investment by tapping global investors from private equity firms to pension funds and oil giants that are pouring billions of dollars into the nation\u2019s renewable companies.ACME has previously locked in investment deals with Brookfield Renewable Partners LP for a 450-megawatt project and with Norway\u2019s Scatec ASA for a 900-megawatt plant. It will fund about three-quarters of the latest expansion plan through loans and sell stakes or some projects outright for the remainder. It is also in talks with potential investors to sell a stake in the solar holding company, which is owned entirely by the founders, and a decision may come as early as this year, Upadhyay said.While many of the concerns linked to the aborted listing persist, mostly linked to the poor financial health of provincial electricity retailers, policies have somewhat shielded the renewable industry.\u201cInvestors have now started to look at renewables differently from coal power,\u201d Upadhyay said, adding that the company will resume public listing plans once it becomes a 10-gigawatts solar power company.Hydrogen PlansThe ACME Group is also moving beyond pure solar generation to tap an anticipated boom in hydrogen demand. It plans to in January start construction on the first, $800 million phase of a green hydrogen-to-green ammonia plant in Oman that is anticipated to have a total cost of $3.5 billion when finisthed in 2024 and be able to produce 2,400 tons a day of green ammonia for export.The company chose Oman for its proximity to export markets and high solar irradiation, features that have already seen the oil-dependent middle-eastern nation plan a mega green hydrogen project powered by 25 gigawatts of renewable electricity. ACME\u2019s plant will build upon the company\u2019s experience with a pilot green hydrogen and green ammonia plant in India\u2019s Rajasthan state that will start production this month, Upadhyay said.The Indian firm has signed a term sheet with the buyer of its Omani product and expects to sign a final contract in about a month, Upadhyay said, declining to name the other party.",

The deal, a mix of both primary and secondary capital, is worth Rs 1,650 crore, a senior company official said.\u201cAugment has acquired a controlling stake in the company as Warburg Pincus and IFC have exited through this transaction,\u201d said Kuldeep Jain, founder and managing director, Cleanmax.Around Rs 750 crore of primary capital will help the company expand capacity and support its inorganic growth plans, Jain said.While Jain refused to share further details of the transaction, sources said that Warburg Pincus has made around 18% IRR on its investment in the company. \u201cBoth the funds together take home around Rs 900 crore, almost double of what they had pumped into the company over the years,\u201d a person with knowledge of the deal said.The transaction comes at a time when profitable exits from infrastructure and energy ventures are hard to come by.Warburg Pincus invested in the company in 2017. \u201cThis journey has validated our strategy to back the market leader in the Indian C&I space led by a talented management team,\u201d said Saurabh Agarwal, Managing Director, Warburg Pincus.Founded in 2011, Cleanmax offers a range of green power sourcing options including rooftop solar, offsite solar, and wind solar hybrid. The company currently serves more than 150 customers including Facebook, Adobe, Cargill Foods, Volvo, Tata Group, Mahindra Group, Grasim, Manjushree, and others.The company has expanded its operating capacity from 110 MW in 2016 to 760 MW. \u201cWe plan to ramp up to 2,000 MW by 2023-24,\u201d Jain added.As part of the transaction, the company has bought back employee stock options worth Rs 30 crore, with around 125 employees participating in the round.The company\u2019s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or Ebitda for the financial year ending 2020-21 stood at Rs 252 crore. \u201cWe look to grow to clock around Rs 350 crore of Ebitda for the current financial year,\u201d Jain added.The company is also backed by UK Climate Investments (UKCI), the UK government\u2019s green fund managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets. UKCI invested Rs 275 crore. \u201cWe are considering an initial public offering in another three to four years to give exit options to our other investors,\u201d Jain said.This is Augment Infrastructure\u2019s first investment in an Indian renewable energy company.\u201cWe believe that Cleanmax is well poised to benefit from the strong growth tailwinds in the sector,\u201d said Darius Lilaoonwala, Managing Partner, Augment Infrastructure.Warburg Pincus has been on a roll, so far this year. Through its investment in Ola, boAT, Adani Ports, Good Host Spaces and Parksons, the firm is increasingly writing bigger cheques for Indian businesses. As far as exits are concerned the fund has either partially or fully exited its investment in Gangavaram Port, Kalyan Jewellers and Bharti Telemedia this year. Its other portfolio firms such as CarTrade and Fusion Microfinance have also lined up their initial public offerings.According to a July 2021 report by Indian Brand Equity Foundation, the renewable energy sector has received more than $42 billion of investments since 2014. The report predicts that the sector will see $500 billion worth of investments by 2028. With bigger conglomerates such as Adani Group and Reliance Industries looking at the sector, the competition is going to intensify. While the Adani Group aims to become the world\u2019s largest solar power company by 2025 and the biggest renewable energy firm by 2030, they have been ramping up their efforts in the sector since the beginning of the year. In May, Adani Green Energy Ltd. acquired 100% interest in SB Energy India from SoftBank Group (SBG) and Bharti Group which has a total renewable portfolio of 4,954 MW spread across four states in India. Before that in March it acquired a 250 MW solar power project in the northern state of Rajasthan (commissioned by Hero Future Energies) for $136.20 million and acquired a 100% stake in SkyPower Global's 50 MW solar power project in Telangana.",

        "articleBody": "Tata Power and Saudi Arabia's AlJomaih Energy & Water Company have emerged the lowest bidders for three solar projects adding up to 500 MW at the Neemuch Solar Park in Madhya Pradesh.The low tariffs quoted by the bidders to supply power from the projects have taken the industry by surprise. TP Saurya, a Tata Power subsidiary, quoted \u20b92.14 per unit for building 170 MW of capacity and \u20b92.149 a unit for another 160 MW in Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Ltd's (RUMSL) auction, people in the know said. Aljomaih won 170 MW quoting \u20b92.15 per unit.Industry experts said the \u20b92.14 per unit tariff was a surprisingly steep decline from a \u20b92.33 per unit per unit winning bid by NTPC in RUMSL\u2019s previous auction.Solar tariffs were expected to rise from a record low of \u20b91.99 a unit last year, as the basic customs duty and approved list of modules and manufacturers will come into effect soon.While a basic customs duty of 25% on solar cells and 40% on solar modules will be imposed from April 2022, the approved list, which comprises solely of locally produced raw materials, is expected to be effective next month. These two factors are expected to raise the project costs, as Indian developers have to pay more to import solar equipment needed for the projects.\u201cThese prices come as a shock,\u201d said a developer speaking on the condition of anonymity, adding that he expected the bids to be around the or slightly lower than the prices quoted in other recent auctions. \u201cThe winning company is presumably using their own captive manufacturing production to fulfill the entire project,  the person added.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries, along with other strategic investors like Paulson & Co Inc and tech mogul Bill Gates, has invested $ 144 million in US-based energy storage company Ambri Inc, the former announced late Monday in a statement.The Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate, through its subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd (RNESL), has invested $ 50 million to acquire 42.3 million shares of preferred stock in Ambri. The transaction is in line with RIL\u2019s strategic plan to invest Rs 75,000 crore over the next three years to build a new clean energy business to fuel its commitment to be net carbon neutral by 2035.\u201cRNESL and Ambri are also in discussions for an exclusive collaboration to set up a large scale battery manufacturing facility in India, which could add scale and further bring down costs for Reliance\u2019s green energy initiative,\u201d RIL said in the statement. Ambri has patented technology and designs with which it manufactures long duration energy storage systems that can last between 4-24 hours. The company can cater to projects that require energy storage systems from 10 megawatts hour to over two gigawatts hour, making it suitable for high-usage applications, such as shifting energy from daytime solar generation to evening and morning peak load times. India aims to scale up its renewable energy capacity to 450 gigawatts by 2030, of which a majority 60% would be from solar power. While the country adds renewable capacity, it has a huge need to build back up power which can be supplied when the renewable power is not available. Typically, countries use gas-based and hydro power to reduce the intermittency inherent to renewable power, but India has not been able to build these capacities and utility scale batteries may help fill this gap.Ambri\u2019s energy storage systems will break through the cost, longevity and safety barriers associated with lithium-ion batteries used in grid-scale stationary storage applications and will enable a crucial energy storage solution capable of supporting the increasing amounts of renewable energy being integrated into electric power grids, RIL said. Ambri will manufacture calcium and antimony electrode-based cells and containerised systems that are more economical than lithium-ion batteries, capable of operating safely in any climatic condition without requiring supplemental air conditioning and meant to last for over 20 years with minimal degradation. The company is securing customers for large-scale projects with commercial operation in 2023 and beyond.Chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders at the company\u2019s Annual General Meet in June that RIL will transform its legacy business into a sustainable, circular and net zero carbon materials business resulting in a \u201cmulti-decade growth path\u201d for the company. A twin strategy will aim at decarbonising and repurposing its existing assets to extend their economic life and earning capacity on one hand, and on building a new energy and materials ecosystem on the other.RIL\u2019s clean energy business plan entails three parts-- Rs 60,000 core investment in four giga factories that will manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components for the business, Rs 15,000 crore investment in building value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries, and repurposing the company\u2019s engineering, project management and construction capabilities towards clean energy. The four giga factories would include an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory, an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyser factory for green hydrogen, and a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power.",

        "articleBody": "In a major relief for renewable power developers in the country, the Appellate Tribunal For Electricity (APTEL) has ordered the Tamil Nadu's state-owned distribution company to pay their dues after curtailing the power generation.According to industry sources, this could lead to a payout of  hundreds of crores, if not more  to leading solar and wind companies generating power in the state such as Adani Green, Tata Power, Shapoorji Pallonji, and Greenko Group.The order states that Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNRC) has to pay 75% of the total curtailed power to these companies, along with a 9% interest between March 2017 to October 2020.This practice will continue for any future curtailments as well. The payments for March 2017 to June 2017 should be made in the next 60 days, APTEL added in its order dated August 2.The electricity will be  deemed  to have been generated, a common practice in the power sector that has been plagued by curtailment issues that don't allow renewable energy companies to generate power to their full capacity.The case was filed by the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) in March 2019. NSEFI is an industry association of renewable power developers in India. With the latest judgment dated 2nd August 2021, APTEL has resolved a long standing problem of backing-down of renewable generators  said Arijit Maitra, counsel for NSEFI. This is a landmark judgement by Hon\u2019ble APTEL. This will go a long way in reinstating confidence in the entire renewable energy sector and will hold utilities and SLDCs [state load despatch centre] accountable for curtailment,  added SubrahmanyamPulipaka, CEO of NSEFI.",

        "articleBody": "US-based solar manufacturing company First Solar is foraying into the Indian market with a 3.3 gigawatt (GW) facility in Tamil Nadu, the company said on Friday.The company will invest $648 million into the manufacturing unit which will become the third location in Asia after Malaysia and Vietnam. First Solar is one of the top three solar manufacturers in the world, and currently has a market cap of $8.9 billion. [India] is an inherently sustainable market, underpinned by a growing economy and appetite for energy, with a well-defined goal that will need over 25 GW of solar to be deployed every year for the next nine years,\u201d said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. \u201cCrucially, it has combined its clean energy targets with effective trade and industrial policy designed to enable self-sufficient domestic manufacturing and true energy security,  Widmar added in a statement issued to the press.It is not clear yet how much of the 3.3 GW facility will be divided into producing solar cells or modules, or if there will be a bifurcation at all. The NASDAQ-listed company also did not mention if they will be utilising the Centre's ?4,500 crore production-linked incentive scheme that was earmarked to promote solar manufacturing in India.As of press time, First Solar had not gotten back to ET's queries on these two queries.However, Widmar underlined the central government's pushback against Chinese solar imports through policy initiatives. Currently, over 80% of India's solar equipment is imported from China.\u201cIndia stands apart in the decisiveness of its response to China\u2019s strategy of state-subsidized global dominance of the crystalline silicon solar supply chain. The country\u2019s comprehensive approach provides precisely the kind of level playing field needed for non-Chinese solar manufacturers to compete on their own merits, and should be a template for other like minded nations,  the CEO said.This is the second American manufacturer in as many months to enter the Indian renewable manufacturing market, which is slated to need nearly 25 GW of solar panels every year to keep up with the government's target of achieving 450 GW of renewable power by 2030. Last month, Boston and Texas-based CubicPV also announced plans to set up manufacturing in India, although the location was yet to be finalised.",

Sterling and Wilson Solar aims to use its project management skills and strong stakeholder relationships to become a global leader in the energy market of the future, it said. Amit Jain, Global CEO, Sterling and Wilson Solar Group, said,  We are delighted to increase our EPC offerings in the renewable space. We believe the opportunities in these segments are huge and will allow us to deepen our relationships with customers both in India as well as globally and provide a range of solutions to meet their overall renewable energy requirements.  With the increased focus globally on low-carbon energy consumption and the resultant growing demand for green energy solutions, this is a logical extension of our business into the rapidly growing ESG space, thereby becoming a diversified renewables company.

        "articleBody": "Domestic solar manufacturers are jittery as the import duty protections to prevent dumping of Chinese modules are expiring by the end of the week, with no replacements in sight yet.The current safeguard duty (SGD) of 14.5% on imports is set to expire on July 30. Due to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, an SGD cannot be applied for more than four years; India is currently in its third year.Even if the SGD is extended for the fourth and final year, WTO rules also dictate a progressively lower rate of duties, which would result in an SGD of approximately 14% for the coming months.Meanwhile, the government plans to levy a basic customs duty of 25% on solar cells and 40% on modules from April 2022. This provides for an 8-month duty holiday window that Indian power developers hope to exploit by stockpiling solar modules for future projects. This period will have a crippling effect on domestic manufacturers, which may also lead to the shutdown of units in India, putting 200,000 jobs at stake in the sector,  said a spokesperson from the All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), an industry body representing domestic solar manufacturers. 84813038AISIA counts Adani Solar, Tata Power Renewables, Waaree, Goldi, and Websol as members. They combine to form 11,000 megawatts of production in India and will reach 20,000 megawatts by the end of the year. Currently, over 80% of Indian solar equipment used in power projects is imported from China. This figure will rise to 100% between August to March, AISIA's spokesperson added. Until BCD comes into effect from April 1, 2022, and safeguard duty expiring in July 2021, the government needs to implement import protection measures against foreign dumping during this gap period,  said Gyanesh Chaudhary, managing director of Vikram Solar, India's largest solar manufacturing company.Favourable global conditions, but Indian manufacturers laggingDespite a host of entry barriers such as the SGD, incoming BCD, and the productivity-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for solar manufacturing, the Indian solar manufacturing industry falls behind in production capacity, technology and prices. Indian modules cost approximately 25% more than their Chinese counterparts.The 25% difference has narrowed since the start of the year, as the global commodity supercycle and Covid-19 linked production delays in China hiked module prices by 35% since June last year. The difference between the price of modules manufactured in India versus imported has narrowed after the recent upsurge in global module prices. If similar gaps persist, the BCD is likely to bridge it, helping domestic module manufactures,  said Debasish Mishra, partner, leader - energy, resources and industrial products, Deloitte India. The international module markets are volatile and prices have seen fluctuations. China itself is struggling to ramp up production after pandemic driven uncertainties,  added Deepto Roy, partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.Solar modules make up 60% of any renewable project's capital expenditure. With the competitive bidding process coming down to single paise, the lack of competitive pricing by Indian companies makes it an easy choice for developers to go the foreign made ones.Some domestic manufacturing companies moved to the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) under the Department of Commerce to impose an anti-dumping duty to cover the duty-free period. However, as of press time Tuesday, DGTR had still not concluded its investigation in the matter. The government is quite committed to the Make in India initiative and thus the solar equipment manufacturers would anticipate that the safeguard duty would be extended to cover this bridge period,  said Hitesh Sachdeva, partner, deal advisory, KPMG India.",

The plan is to be a three-GW facility, and we are planning to invest another Rs 500 crore in the coming four months to add another (one) GW and again Rs 500 crore in the next financial year. So, the idea is to become 3 GW facility from 1.25 GW Module and 1.75 GW Cells,  Premier Energies founder and Managing Director Chiranjeev Saluja said in a statement.He added that the company is planning to invest another Rs 1,000-Rs 1,200 crore over the next two years.Currently, Premier Energies has an annual manufacturing capacity of 1.25 GW modules and 0.75 GW cells.Premier Energies, one of the country's leading solar PV cells and module manufacturing company, is set to launch its new state-of-the-art facility at E-City Hyderabad, according to the statement.Built with an investment of Rs 483 crore, the new venture will elevate the company among the top-five solar manufacturing players in India.The formal inauguration of this new plant by K T Rama Rao, Minister of Municipal Administration and Urban Development of Telangana, is scheduled for July 29, it stated.The new manufacturing unit, a greenfield (fresh) project with a capacity of 750 MW solar cells and 750 MW solar modules, will produce MCCE-textured multi-crystalline cells and modules, mono PERC cells and modules as well as 19.2 per cent efficiency polycrystalline cells and modules.The plant has been designed to produce the latest generation products by incorporating monocrystalline PERC technology. This technology will usher in change by increasing the wafer size to 182 mm and 210 mm.The ISO 9001/ ISO 14001-certified manufacturing facility uses state-of-the-art production systems such as TQC (total quality control) and SPC (statistical process control).This launch will therefore increase the availability of the high-quality made-in-India solar cells aligned to Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives.Speaking on the significant launch, Premier Energies founder and Chairman Surender Pal Singh said,  It has been our vision to set up a business that would contribute to the environment for the larger good of the society. This new world-class facility takes us a step closer to this vision. Saluja also stated that this new facility is a symbol of our strong commitment to the the Indian power sector, and a shining example of the success of the government's 'Make in India' initiative.Headquartered in Greater Hyderabad, Telangana, the company is now second-largest integrated manufacturer of solar cells and modules in India. The company has completed 25 years of operations in 2020. ",

        "articleBody": "US solar equipment maker CubicPV has earmarked at least $350 million for investment in a manufacturing facility in India, drawn by the government\u2019s incentive schemes for local production, the company\u2019s chief executive officer told ET.The proposed plant will be set up in partnership with an Indian company if CubicPV\u2019s technology qualifies for government grant, Frank van Mierlo said.The plant, which will mark CubicPV\u2019s entry into India\u2019s renewable energy sector, will manufacture solar wafers and solar cells, with capacity expected to touch 4,000 mw by late 2023, he said. Half of this capacity will go towards manufacturing wafers--a key raw material for making solar panels\u2014and the other half will be used for assembling the wafers into solar cells.Van Mierlo said the Centre's incentive schemes in the solar sector, particularly the basic customs duty on Chinese imports starting April 2022 and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme worth Rs 4,500 crore, were the main reasons for CubicPV to look towards entering the Indian renewables segment. The Indian government has put in place the approved list of modules and manufacturers, the domestic content requirements, the basic customs duty, and the PLI scheme: these four interlocking policies are going to an industry where in three years, all modules in India will be domestically produced,  Van Mierlo said over phone from Boston.  You have to give the Modi government credit for interlocking incentives to make this possible. He said CubicPV will apply for the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme next month, and is confident that their wafer manufacturing technology will qualify for the government's grant.Van Mierlo said CubicPV's technology, which boasts efficiency rates as high as 30%, is ready to scale right now, making India an attractive destination to deploy the technology.However, he said the company is wary of entering the Indian market alone, citing the host of regulatory challenges that the Indian power sector brings with it.   84701275 India is a complex place, and in order to be successful, we're going to need local partners. We're actively pursuing that,  Van Mierlo said, adding that they will be looking at multiple partnerships rather than restricting themselves to one company.Formed in June, CubicPV is a merger between two American solar manufacturers--1366 Technologies and Hunt Perovskite Technologies (HPT). The companies have invested $300 million so far in research and development since the merger.As the incentives for domestic manufacturing kick in, experts said capacity additions could surge in the next couple of years. Solar energy capacity additions are set to gain pace after being modest in FY21 at 5.5 gw. In FY22 and FY23, one can expect 28-30 gw of capacities of solar energy to be installed,  said Hetal Gandhi, director, CRISIL Research. As government of India initiates PLI and imposes BCD on solar modules and cells from FY23 onwards, local capacities are gearing up. In Q1 itself, 2.2 gw of module capacity has been added and 1 gw should be added over next 8-10 months,  Gandhi said.",

        "articleBody": "Leading European nation Sweden on Friday said it has ratified the framework agreement for the International Solar Alliance, an initiative of India aimed at promoting renewable energy and sustainable development. Swedish Ambassador to India, Klas Molin, said Sweden is happy to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA). He said Sweden hopes to bring its expertise and its experience in renewable energy and clean energy technologies to discussions in the ISA to contribute in meeting the challenges related to climate change.  Sweden is happy to join the ISA. Prime Minister Lofven reiterated to Prime Minister Modi the need for enhanced global cooperation at their last meeting,  Molin said.  The creation and development of the ISA as an instrumental framework, in which India plays a leading role, is an important step in this direction,  he added. Sweden's ratification of the ISA came over four months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Swedish premier Stefan Lofven held a virtual summit focusing on boosting cooperation in areas of innovation, technology and climate change. The Swedish embassy in India, in a statement, said that Sweden has ratified and deposited the framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance and its membership of the ISA entered into force on July 17. The ISA has been conceived as an action-oriented, member-driven, collaborative platform to increase the availability of solar energy technologies to enhance energy security and sustainable development. Director General of ISA, Ajay Mathur, said he was delighted to welcome Sweden into ISA.  This is the starting point of a strategic partnership between ISA and Sweden. I am sure we can achieve sustainable, equitable and more prosperous future for all through solar energy,  he said. The ties between India and Sweden are on an upswing in the last few years. In April 2018, Prime Minister Modi visited Stockholm during which both sides agreed to further deepen innovation partnership for a sustainable future. It was a visit to Sweden by an Indian prime minister after nearly three decades.",

        "articleBody": "For all the lives lost and economic damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, it\u2019s also managed to hurt efforts to combat climate change.Corporate demand for clean electricity is declining for the first time because more employees are working from home than ever before. This is most notable for companies in the RE100, which have all pledged to offset 100% of their electricity consumption with clean energy.Ninety-four of the 222 RE100 companies that have disclosed electricity demand data for both 2019 and 2020 reported drops in their consumption as they adjusted to remote work environments last year, said Kyle Harrison, a New York-based corporate energy strategist at BloombergNEF.\u201cThe RE100 still presents an incredible clean energy investment opportunity, but the long-term outlook has dampened slightly,\u201d Harrison said.While large energy users saw significant increases in their electricity consumption, such as QTS Realty Trust (29%), General Motors (28%), Schneider Electric (25%) and Vodafone (17%), this wasn\u2019t enough to offset the declines from other companies, Harrison said. Notable companies that reported the largest decreases included AstraZeneca (13%), Signify (23%) and Siemens (36%).84622251For some, the slide in consumption may be a temporary setback, but for others, it may take years to recover as businesses turn to a full or hybrid remote work environment.The more than 300 companies in the RE100 that set 100% clean energy goals will need to purchase an additional 247 terrawatts (TWh) of clean energy in 2030, BNEF estimates. That\u2019s down from the previous 269TWh forecast from the research firm in January, and marks the first time the 2030 outlook has dropped.The largest providers of clean electricity to corporations are Invenergy LLC, Ignis, Engie SA, NextEra Energy Inc. and Orsted A/S, according to BNEF. While the outlook for clean electricity remains bullish for now, the drop in electricity consumption from the private sector is something developers should keep an eye on, Harrison said.The volume of corporate power purchase agreements did increase 86% in the first half of 2021 from the year-earlier period, as the world emerged from what had been the worst wave of the pandemic. \u201cWhile corporate demand remains a healthy opportunity for clean energy developers, the Covid-19 pandemic may still rear its ugly head down the line,\u201d he said.Microsoft Corp. announced 35 new power purchase agreements last week for solar and wind to become the second-largest corporate buyer of clean energy globally. The deals underpin a broader strategy from Microsoft to have its hourly electricity consumption matched with clean energy at all times by 2030, Harrison said.The S&P Global Clean Energy Index, which includes NextEra and Orsted, has advanced 177% since the start of 2019, and that includes this year\u2019s decline of 21%.Despite the recent sell-off, green-energy companies Orsted, Neoen SA and Solaria Energia y Medio Ambiente SA still trade at higher enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) multiples than most integrated utilities (Enel SpA, Iberdrola SA and Engie SA) and even some tech giants (Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc.), according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Elchin Mammadov.Huge capacity-growth prospects for wind and solar-power developers and the ascent of ESG investing may keep \u201csupporting premium valuations of the green sub-sector after the recent de-rating,\u201d he said.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Infrastructure-led BSES Delhi discoms have signed contracts with Solar Energy Corp of India to procure 510 mw solar power at Rs 2.44 per unit and bundled hybrid power at Rs 2.48 per unit. Of the total quantum of 510 mw, 300 mw is solar power and 210 mw is hybrid power, an official statement said.  \u201cReliance Infrastructure-led BSES discoms have become the first discom in Delhi and among only a handful in the country to procure hybrid power. Hybrid power is a bundled mix of solar and wind power, wherein one component is atleast 33% of the contracted capacity,\u201d the statement said. In hybrid power, both the sources of power are co-located at the same location and the pooled power is injected into the electricity system at the same point. The advantage of hybrid power is optimum cost utilisation of the power evacuation network as solar power is primarily a day phenomenon and wind, round-the-clock, it said. Inked for a period of 25 years, the solar and hybrid power is expected to be available to BSES discoms in 18 months. \u201cWe have been procuring renewable energy from all available renewable sources at economical rates, ensuring minimal burden on the consumers. These agreements are yet another proof of our efforts in this direction. It will provide further impetus to our efforts to provide green and clean power to Delhi consumers,\u201d a BSES spokesperson said.The statement said the contracts are priced substantially lower than the average cost of power purchase agreements, which are around Rs 5.5 per unit and this agreement will help BSES discoms to fulfil their renewable purchase obligations. It is pertinent to note that Delhi experiences peak power demand twice in a 24-hour period. While solar power will help the discom meet the day peak, the wind-power sourced from the coastal areas is expected to support the night peak demand. Moreover, the supply of bundled solar and wind power will lessen the variations in scheduling power in comparison to a contract for pure wind power, it said.The Delhi electricity regulator has written to the Union power ministry seeking deallocation of share of two BSES discoms in the state from NTPC\u2019s Dadri I unit.The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has sought permanent reallocation \u201con urgent basis entire Delhi\u2019s share of Dadri-I generating station of NTPC to other needy states w.e.f 1st December, 2020 to avoid the burden of fixed cost without any power scheduled to end consumers of Delhi.\u201d BSES discoms plan to surrender power from six NTPC plants and have filed for exiting two such PPAs in DERC.The DERC letter comes after the power ministry allowed BSES Delhi discoms to exit power purchase agreement with NTPC\u2019s Dadri-I unit, in a first of its kind move that is likely to trigger many such requests. Delhi regulator had also written to the ministry in March this year requesting deallocation of entire 756 mw quantum of Delhi share from Dadri-I. It said the optimisation of power purchase cost of Delhi will benefit power consumers.",

A lot of big corporates are also announcing plans to get into the sector, which shows the confidence and the opportunity that is available,\u201d said Saibaba Vutukuri, chief executive of Vikram Solar.The government plans to have a renewable energy capacity of 450 GW by 2030.\u201cWe're talking about 25 GW (of annual demand for locally sourced solar panels). We anticipate the price of solar power to go down, and more and more reduction is happening,\u201d he said The Chennai unit will not utilise the government's Productivity-Linked Incentive scheme worth Rs 4,500 crore, as it does not meet the requirements to tap into the funds.Vikram Solar\u2019s existing manufacturing unit, with a capacity of 1,200 MW, is based in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Kolkata. As per the government rules on Basic Customs Duty (BCD), SEZs will face BCD on the finished product.Due to regulatory challenges faced by SEZs, the company had to look for a non-SEZ location like Chennai for expansion, Vutukuri said.The facility is spread over 1.3 million square feet and will produce solar cells and modules. On average, Vikram Solar exports 25-30% of panels.The company hopes to capitalise on the Indian solar industry's drive to cut dependence on China, from where 80% of equipment is currently imported.  Today too India has 8 GW of capacity but mostly used for rooftop or exports given technology lag of Indian players,  said Hetal Gandhi, director, CRISIL Research. However, integrated plants would be key to competitiveness. Without backward integration until poly-silicon stage in turn will result in tariff rise in the interim but PLI+ BCD along with other tax benefits would be needed to keep players competitive in the medium term,  Gandhi added.The BCD and usage of an approved list of models and manufacturers for government projects are incentives that are expected to propel developers to use Indian components.",

Owing to the sub-standard quality of components being used at several places, the country is likely to witness a faster rate of early loss of PV modules. By 2030, close to 3,00,000 tons and by 2050, nearly 7,500,000 tons of solar waste is likely to pile up.Currently, there are no laws that mandate safe disposal of solar energy waste unlike WEEE in Europe and it needs to be accorded priority to ensure no land filling. A not-for-profit organisation can formulate a roadmap to pave the way for a safe end of life management using low-cost recycling equipment and ensure they are used for re-powering. About 240,000 MW of new panels can be re-produced without extracting new materials. It will result in the overall CO2 abatement of 360 billion tons in their lifetime. Jaideep N Malaviya is an expert on solar energy waste management. He spoke to TOI about the pros and cons concerning the issue. Excerpts...Q. Why do solar panels need recycling?A. India has set an ambitious target of 450 GW of renewable, largely using solar energy. All solar energy systems must be subject to the extended producer responsibility (EPR). Recycling will create more jobs and re-harvest the basic raw material to re-power. Let the new 3Rs be \u2018recycle, reuse and regenerate\u2019 instead of reject. Re-use of materials will greatly reduce the carbon foot-print as compared to fresh mining. The recycling entity can recover its cost by trading the raw material.Q. How do solar panels become a waste?A. The crystalline solar modules (panels) last 20 years or so. However, some manufacturers also claim life beyond this period. Our analysis shows that with recurring high efficiency, solar cell technologies end-users may opt for re-powering once the investment is recovered as it will give a higher yield. This will result in far sooner waste. We anticipate about 20,000 tons of waste by the year 2030 and eventually, 2,00,00,000 tons by 2050.Q. Are solar panels hazardous to the environment?A. Typical crystalline silicon solar modules (panels) have almost 95% (by weight) aluminium, glass, silicon, copper and metal parts that are recoverable and recyclable. The balance 5% polymer sheets are still a challenge to recycle and are a potential hazard to landfill as it contains fluorspar. Solar thermal panels (collectors) are 100% recyclable and easy to do. It will be interesting to undertake a detailed study on how much carbon footprint will be avoided if solar modules are recycled and reproduced instead of freshly mining raw materials. This is the only way it can put pressure on the government to consider it earnestly.Q. How is the government planning to address the issue of solar energy management?A. While inverters and batteries are already governed under electronics and battery waste management laws in India, there are none for solar modules. It is understood that an initiative has already been taken by the government to address the issue of solar energy \u2018Circular Economy\u2019 by forming a committee comprising of Industry associations, institutes and experts. What is required at this stage is to undertake R&D on developing low-cost recycling techniques to make it economical. India can set a benchmark for the consortium countries of the International Solar Alliance (ISA).Q. How does the current landscape of solar recycling in India compare to the markets across the world? A. There is no regulation or law that binds any solar module to be mandatorily sent for recycling. There is a need for an immediate bylaw to make sure all future solar modules made/imported in India have a cost of recycling built in as EPR. The classification of EPR has also to be clearly defined. Only Europe has a mandatory law on solar energy recycling under the Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment (WEEE). India needs to be \u2018atmanirbhar\u2019 in the entire value chain.Q. What are some of the main barriers for solar panel recycling?A. A database will have to be created of all installed domestic and imported solar modules in the country. This is necessary to ensure they are not dumped and break the EPR law. The EPR definition will require manufacturers to take back the waste and recycle, which will be an expense to them as they had not built in the recycling cost earlier. A preliminary study shows that a minimum 5,000 tons of solar module waste is feasible for setting up a recycling facility. Considering our vast geographic location, we will need multiple collection centres after de-framing the modules at the site. A central recycling facility that reduces the logistics cost will be economical. Nagpur fit the bill as it is centrally located and well connected with the rest of the country. Refurbishing modules, if disposed early, should be avoided as it may lead to fraud and malpractice. Q. What are some of the advantages for solar manufacturers that integrate recycling practices into their business operations?A. There is not much knowledge available on low-cost recycling. Manufacturers of solar modules have a very prominent role to play. The policies for recycling must be manufacturer-friendly. A devoted not-for-profit organisation of solar module manufacturers can function as a catalyst between the government, regulatory bodies and end-users to facilitate safe disposal. The body can invite entrepreneurs and researchers to offer low-cost solutions funded as part of the industry-institute partnership. The recovered materials can be then traded with the module manufacturers. Q. What is the current status for disposal of solar panels?A. Presently, it is sold as scrap in the open market.",

A consortium led by French state-run power utility Electricite de France SA (EDF) has been tasked with creating the roadmap to build a global ecosystem of interconnected renewable energy resources under 'One Sun, One World and One Grid' (OSOWOG).  EDF is carrying out the pre-feasibility study and next month the report is expected,  Mathur told . India-initiated ISA is heading the project with the support of World Bank to promote renewable energy and mitigate carbon footprint. The OSOWOG project will be implemented in three phases. In the first phase, the Indian grid will be connected with grids in West Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia to share solar and other renewable energy resources. In the second phase, the first-phase nations will be connected with the African pool of renewable resources. The third phase will be the final step for global inter- connections. The project aims to link as many as 140 countries through a common grid that will be used to transfer solar power. Mathur, who was in Kolkata to attend an event of the Bengal Chamber, said India's inter-ministerial coordination group on the initiative, involving four-five Union ministries, is also being set up.  The report on institutional regulatory is also likely in the next three-four months. The government's inter- ministerial co-ordination group is expected to be formed in a month,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "Infrastructure investment trust IndiGrid on Wednesday said it has completed the acquisition of entire stake in two solar energy assets with cumulative capacity of 100 MW from Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) at an enterprise value of Rs 660 crore. IndiGrid's acquisition of its first solar asset is an important milestone in the Indian infrastructure sector as this marks the first renewable energy acquisition by any InvIT in the country, the company said in a statement.   India Grid Trust, India's first power infrastructure investment trust (InvIT), announced the completion of acquisition of 100 per cent stake in two solar assets with cumulative capacity of 100 MW (AC) from Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) at an enterprise value of Rs 6.6 billion (Rs 660 crore),  it said.  With this acquisition, the company's asset portfolio will now consist of 14 diversified power projects consisting of 40 transmission lines (7,570 circuit kilometers) ,11 substations (13,550 MVA capacity) and 100 MW of solar power plants across 18 states and one Union Territory.  The 100 MW assets are fully operational and located in a high radiation zone in the 400 MW Ananthapuramu Solar Park in Andhra Pradesh with a contractual period of 25 years at a fixed tariff.  Power purchase agreements for both assets are already in place with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) a limited liability company owned 100 per cent by the Government of India, as the counterparty.  These projects use Tier I equipment and are eligible to receive a fixed tariff on per unit of electricity generated thus limiting the operational risk. The projects have been operational for over two years and have a robust track record of generation and collections since inception.  This transaction is in line with IndiGrid's strategy to acquire solar projects with long term power purchase agreements, operational track record and financially strong counterparties / off-takers such as SECI and NTPC.  In addition to long contract life and low-risk cash flows, this asset complements IndiGrid's transmission portfolio with synergies on operations and regulatory establishments. The acquisition will be funded through a combination of debt, internal accruals and proceeds of recent Rights Issue.  The net debt/AUM (assets under management) stands around 58 per cent post this acquisition, providing adequate headroom for growth against the 70 per cent leverage threshold as per SEBI InvIT Regulations.  Harsh Shah, CEO of IndiGrid, said,  This acquisition is DPU (distribution per unit) accretive and would result in healthy addition to our net distributable cash flow.   While power transmission assets remain at the core of IndiGrid's growth strategy, we believe such attractive opportunities to acquire good quality solar projects ties in well with our strategy of providing predictable cash flows to our investors and reinforces our commitment to be a socially responsible organisation.   Cyril Amarchand and Mangaldas, PriceWater Coopers and Mahindra Teqo advised IndiGrid on this transaction. Greenstone Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor on the transaction representing FRV.  IndiGrid owns 14 operating power projects consisting of 40 transmission lines with more than 7,570 ckms (circuit kilometers) length, 11 substations with 13,550 MVA transformation capacity and 100 MW of solar generation capacity.  IndiGrid has assets under management (AUM) of over Rs 21,000 crore (USD 2.83 billion). The investment manager of IndiGrid is majority owned by KKR.",

        "articleBody": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd. is considering a bid for India's incentives for solar power manufacturing, as the fossil-fuels giant begins a $10 billion push into clean energy, according to people familiar with the plans.Reliance, India\u2019s most valuable company, attended a pre-bid meeting held last month to discuss the subsidy program, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is private.The talks underline Ambani\u2019s ambitions for the company to make rapid growth in renewable energy to supplement its existing businesses. Reliance said last month it plans to build factories to produce solar components, energy storage batteries, electrolysers for making green hydrogen and fuel cells.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has announced financial benefits for manufacturing in a range of sectors, including solar energy and batteries, to revive an economy battered by the pandemic and to reduce dependence on imports. Souring relations with China, India\u2019s biggest trade partner and supplier of nearly 80% of the country\u2019s solar modules, have bolstered the push for self-dependence.It\u2019s an opportunity that\u2019s drawing local and foreign investors. State-run miner Coal India Ltd., which is examining new businesses to offset a slowdown in demand for the fuel, is also considering putting in bids for subsidies to manufacture solar equipment, the people said. U.S. firm CubicPV Inc. said this month it\u2019s looking for an Indian partner to jointly bid for the incentives.India, the world\u2019s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, plans to expand its renewable power capacity nearly five-fold to 450 gigawatts by the end of the decade, aiming to reduce dependence on fossil fuels that currently drive its economy. Solar power will account for around 62% of the 2030 target, meaning the country will need to add about 26 gigawatts of capacity annually for the next nine years. The country\u2019s own factories can currently meet less than half the demand for modules.The government is giving $603 million to companies setting up solar manufacturing facilities. Proposals like the plan Reliance unveiled last month, to make the entire chain of products -- from raw material polysilicon to finished modules -- would win preferential treatment, ministry documents show.",

        "articleBody": "Energy firm Amplus Solar on Monday said its residential venture 'HomeSpace' has successfully solarised President Ram Nath Kovind's parental home 'Milan Kendra' in UP.     The residence located at village Paraunkh, about 80 kilometres from Kanpur, is now powered by a 5 kilowatt (kW) solar plant set up on its rooftop, Amplus Solar said in a statement.      HomeScape, the residential venture of India's leading distributed energy company Amplus Solar, has successfully solarised 'Milan Kendra', parental home of the President Ram Nath Kovind where President Kovind was born,  it said.     The solar plant was gifted by HomeScape to support the government's vision and initiatives to promote solar. It was installed just prior to President Kovind's Rail Yatra to his parental village for the inauguration of Milan Kendra recently, it said.   Rooftop solar, especially in the residential segment, is an ideal solution for a country like India where land is scarce and expensive. Installing solar at 'Milan Kendra' has been an honour for us at Amplus Solar. We are certain this will surely raise awareness and provide a much-needed impetus to the residential solar segment,  Sanjeev Aggarwal, Managing Director and CEO, Amplus Solar, said.     The solar plant was installed within a single day by the HomeScape team with the assistance of the Discom (Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam), Uttar Power Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) and the Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department (UP PWD), it said.     The plant will generate a total of 1,72,500 kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity.",

        "articleBody": "Inching towards clean energy, GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd. (GHIAL) that manages Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Hyderabad, has commissioned its second five MW solar power plant. With this, GHIAL's total solar power capacity has now increased to 10 MW, a press release from GMR said on Monday. In 2015, GHIAL commissioned a 5 MW Solar Power Plant for its captive consumption. Spread over an area of 45 acres, more than 30,000 solar panels have been installed to produce 10 MW power. Both the solar plants have advanced ABB central inverters and polycrystalline PV panels, which are far more efficient than mono crystalline solar PV panels, it said. With the commissioning of this additional capacity, GHIAL will be able to reduce the dependency for power from the Telangana State Electricity Board by 12 million units per year, thereby saving around Rs 90 lakh per month, the release said. With this addition of solar power generation, 50per cent of the energy requirements of the Airport will be met. There will be a reduction in carbon footprint by about 28 lakh kg of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to saving 1.4 lakh full grown trees, it said. Pradeep Panicker, CEO - GHIAL said,  GMR Hyderabad International Airport is committed to green and renewable energy. As a member airport of the ACI (Airports Council International), we have committed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We continue to do our best in that direction. ",

        "articleBody": "The global solar sector including the Indian market has witnessed total corporate funding of USD 13.5 billion in January-June period of 2021, registering a jump of nearly three-folds over the previous year, according to a report. Total corporate funding, including venture capital funding, public market and debt financing, into the solar sector stood at USD 4.6 billion during the same period of 2020, the report by clean energy consulting firm Mercom Capital Group said. Funding was up across the board in the first half of 2021 compared to last year, which was severely affected by the pandemic. Corporate M&A activity was up with solar developers expanding their pipelines, oil and gas companies diversifying into renewables, and funds buying up renewable assets,  said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. The transition from fossil fuels to renewables and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing trends made an impact on financing as well as merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. The venture capital (VC) funding in first half (H1) of 2021 rose by 680 per cent higher to USD 1.6 billion in 26 deals, compared to the USD 210 million that went into 14 deals in 2020.Solar public market financing in 1H 2021 was 386 per cent higher, with USD 3.7 billion raised in 13 deals compared to USD 758 million raised in six deals in January-June 2020.The global debt financing activity in January-June period of ongoing year was at USD 8.2 billion in 32 deals, up 125 per cent from USD 3.7 billion raised in 17 deals in the first half of 2020. The report further said there were 34 solar corporate M&A transactions in April-June 2021 compared to 20 in January-March 2021 and 13 transactions in Q2 or April-June 2020.",

        "articleBody": "Renewable energy capacity addition in India is likely to improve to 11 GW in 2021-22 though the solar bid tariffs could go up amid rising module prices, ICRA said on Thursday.  While there is a slowdown in renewable energy (RE) capacity addition to 7.4 GW in FY2021 from 8.7 GW in FY2020 amid the execution headwinds due to COVID-19, ICRA expects the capacity addition to improve to 10.5 to 11 GW in FY2022 led by a strong project pipeline of 38 GW,  ICRA said in a statement.  Also, more than 20 GW RE projects are under the tendering phase from various nodal agencies, providing visibility for capacity addition over the medium-term, it added.   The RE sector is expected to witness investments of Rs 3.5 trillion (Rs 3.5 lakh crore) over the next four years, increasing the share of RE capacity to 34 per cent of the overall installed capacity by March 2025 from 25 per cent as of March 2021 led by the solar power segment,  said Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA.  However, Kadam said the delays in signing of PPAs/PSAs (power purchase or sale agreements) as observed in the past and cancellation of bids owing to expectations of a reduction in tariff rates, remains a key challenge.  Nonetheless, given the expected rise in solar bid tariffs in the upcoming auctions amid the rise in module prices and imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported solar PV cells & modules from April 2022, progress is expected in signing of PPAs/PSAs for the earlier awarded tenders by the central intermediate procurers, he stated.  Despite the rise in tariff, the solar power tariffs are expected to remain below Rs 3 per unit and cost competitive, against the marginal cost of generation from thermal sources in the bottom 25 per cent of the merit order dispatch, ICRA said.  On the other hand, the execution challenges persist for the under-construction projects with respect to land acquisition and evacuation infrastructure, especially in the wind power segment, it added.  In this context, the government has approved extension in commissioning timeline by 2.5 months, considering the second wave of COVID-19. Also, the government has extended the waiver on inter-state transmission charges for wind and solar power projects commissioned till June 2025 from June 2023 earlier, it stated.  Further, the demand outlook for domestic solar original equipment makers remains favourable, with the strong policy support through imposition of BCD on imported cells and modules and the notification of the production-linked incentive scheme along with a strong order pipeline of 35-40 GW over the next three to five years from various schemes requiring the use of domestic modules.  Also, the delays in inclusion of overseas suppliers in the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) could support the demand for domestic module original equipment makers (OEMs) in the near term.  Vikram V, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said the policy push for the promotion of domestic module manufacturing is expected to improve the cost competitiveness of domestic OEMs and has led to new capacity announcements of more than 15-GW by various OEMs.   The timely commissioning of these new capacities remains important to meet the growing demand from the developers, given the current capacity constraints. Moreover, the ability of the OEMs to achieve backward integration and build economies of scale would be important to remain competitive against the overseas suppliers on a sustained basis,  he said.  That apart, the credit profile of operational RE projects remains constrained by the exposure to discoms in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, with large payment overdues.  The overall dues from discoms to RE independent power producers (IPPs) remained high at Rs 11,840 crore as of April 2021, declining marginally from Rs 12,270 crore as of January 2021, as per the data from the PRAA portal.  Nonetheless, the credit profile of ICRA-rated RE IPPs is supported by the presence of liquidity buffer in the form of debt service reserve or working capital and relatively strong sponsor profile.  Overall, ICRA's outlook for the RE sector remains stable, driven by factors such as continued policy support from the government , large growth potential, the presence of creditworthy central nodal agencies as intermediary procurers and tariff competitiveness, it said.",

        "articleBody": "Tata Power plans to add renewable energy projects to grow to 15 GW company in the coming few years, its chairperson Natarajan Chandrasekaran said on Monday.In the consumer renewables business, the company would focus on building scale in its rooftop solar, solar pumps, electric vehicle charging systems and home automation businesses, he said in the Annual General Meeting.The company\u2019s website showed an operating capacity of 1839 Mw renewable energy capacity comprising 907 Mw wind power and 932 Mw solar power. Another 373 Mw of wind and solar capacity is under development.He said the company is witnessing strong growth in rooftop solar and solar pumps segments. \u201cThe company currently has the highest ever EPC order book and is expanding solar cells and modules manufacturing capacity. It also won over 1 Gw renewables capacity projects during the year,\u201d Chandrasekaran said.He said the company continues to divest non-core assets to simplify the business. Apart from the sale of the defense business, this year, it completed the divestment of its South Africa wind assets and its shipping business.\u201cAs I had mentioned last year, deleveraging of the balance sheet is a core focus area. This year, Tata Sons infused Rs 2,600 crore of preferential equity in the company to strengthen the Balance Sheet. Also the proceeds from the divestments were utilised to further reduce the debt,\u201d he said.Last year, Tata Power completed acquisition of three distribution license areas in Odisha and one in April this financial year. The Company distributes power in Mumbai, Delhi, Ajmer, besides Odisha.Lower coal prices helped curtail losses in imported coal-based Mundra ultra mega power project. \u201cBased on studies, the company believes that coal prices will moderate in the medium to long term, thereby reducing the support requirement,\u201d Chandrasekaran said. Tata Power reported consolidated net profit of Rs 1,439 crore in last fiscal. The consolidated profit after tax before exceptional items stood at Rs 1,424 crore as against Rs 1,231 crore in the previous year, due to lower losses in Mundra project and higher profit from acquisition of Prayagaj power project in Uttar Pradesh. The consolidated revenues in the year were Rs 33,079 crore, compared to Rs 28,948 crore a year ago, representing an increase of about 14% owing to revenue growth through three Odisha discoms and execution of solar EPC projects. The cash generated from operations increased by 15% to Rs 8,458 crore in the year. The consolidated net debt at the end of the year was Rs 35,946 crore, reduction of about Rs 7, 600 crore over the previous year level of Rs 43,559 crore.",

        "articleBody": "Renewable power sources covered 28.8% of China's electricity consumption in 2020, up 1.3 percentage points from 2019, the country's National Energy Administration (NEA) said in a statement on Monday. China's state planner in 2016 launched a scheme asking grid firms in some northern and northwestern to buy electricity generated by solar and wind power stations. President Xi Jinping has vowed to make China  carbon neutral  by 2060, and to boost the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25% by 2030 from a previous commitment of 20%. According to a draft plan seen by Reuters in February, the central government planned to force regional grid firms to buy at least 40% of power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. The NEA statement showed that average wind power utilisation rates were 97% in 2020, exceeding the target set by central government by 2 percentage points, while average solar power utilisation rates were 98%, 3 percentage higher than the target.",

        "articleBody": "Anant Ambani has reportedly been appointed as director of Reliance New Energy Solar and Reliance New Solar Energy \u2014 new solar companies that were established two weeks ago as part of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL\u2019s) clean energy push. With this appointment, Anant Ambani, the younger son of Reliance Industries (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani, will see his role expanding in the family business. Mukesh Ambani announced the company's foray into clean energy business with a planned investment of Rs 75,000 crore over the next three years at its annual shareholder meet on June 24.Earlier in February, Anant, 26, was inducted as a director of Reliance O2C, where Saudi Aramco is expected to be an investor, and a year before that, he was appointed on the board of Jio Platforms, where his siblings Isha and Akash too are members. Though, Mukesh Ambani, 64, hasn't yet talked about succession plan at RIL, questions like 'who's next?' are getting traction within the investor community. After RIL founder Dhirubhai Ambani's demise in 2002, the company witnessed a prolonged feud over succession between Mukesh and his brother Anil Ambani. Dhirubhai had not left a will and the family business had to be split, with Mukesh getting RIL (oil refining and petrochemicals) and Anil acquired the energy, finance and telecom units as part of the settlement.Besides Jio Platforms, Isha and Akash, the 29-year-old twins, are on the board of Reliance Retail Ventures. Both Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures had attracted billions of dollars in investments and brought on board global names such as Google, Facebook, Silver Lake and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to help expand their digital and e-commerce footprint.With Anant's latest board appointments, all the three children now have representation in RIL's key businesses. After the recent separation of the refining and petrochemicals unit to Reliance O2C, RIL looks similar to Tata Sons, the holding company of Tata Group's diverse businesses. RIL is also paving the way for initial public offerings of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures, which are expected to take place in the near future.Apart from Reliance New Energy Solar and Reliance New Solar Energy, RIL incorporated five other entities since June - Reliance New Energy Storage, Reliance Solar Projects, Reliance Storage, Reliance New Energy Carbon Fibre and Reliance New Energy Hydrogen Electrolysis. Their names indicate that the entities were established for the clean energy game.All the seven companies have three directors each. A common director in all these entities is Shanker Natarajan.(With inputs from TOI)",

In 2020, we became the largest solar company in the world. Last month (May 2021), we caught up to our renewables target of 25 GW, a full four years ahead of schedule. Our green energy arm is on track to be the world's largest renewable energy company by 2030. No other organisation in the world has accelerated its renewables footprint as rapidly as the Adani Group,  he said.In his address, Adani also said that as a part of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the group is doubling its solar cell and module manufacturing capacity to 4 GW.The group is also expanding the domestic manufacturing ecosystem for renewables business, including a new wind turbine manufacturing cluster in Mundra, he added.The group's businesses are aligned not just with India's climate change goals but also with the global drive towards net-zero emissions, he said.Adani added that its ports are committed to becoming carbon neutral, achieving zero waste to landfill, replacing single-use plastic, and to afforestation exceeding 5,000 hectares by 2025.Adani further said,  Every new business that we incubate is driven by sustainability goals, be it a network of data centres powered by renewable energy, green hydrogen exploration with partners like Snam and Tecnimont, or the green hydrogen projects. Adani Group intends to continue investing in such technologies and take the steps to fulfill our ESG (environmental, social and governance) goals. We will do so by carefully balancing our energy migration from carbon-positive to carbon-neutral, and further on to carbon-negative,  he said. ",

        "articleBody": "After the success of Pavagada Solar park in Tumakuru, the Karnataka government is planning to establish yet another solar park in the district, this time in Madhugiri taluk. The initiative was announced by Energy Minister K J George in Tumakuru.  The upcoming project will not only scale up Karnataka's clean energy infrastructure, but also holds the potential to significantly enhance environmental stewardship and energy security in the state,  he said. Madhugiri Solar Park will be developed in a strategic partnership with Tehri Hydro Development Corporation India Limited (THDCIL), owned by the central government.  This partnership aims to leverage local expertise and resources to identify suitable land parcels essential for advancing Karnataka's renewable energy agenda, instilling confidence in the project's success,  added George. The energy minister was visiting Tumakuru to review the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM KUSUM) project at the district commissioner's office.  The subsidy for free electricity for farmers' pump sets is increasing annually. Despite efforts to regularise farmers' pump sets, the issue persists, leading to transformer damage and power supply disruptions due to illegal connections. In this context, we are prioritising the KUSUSM B and Kusum C projects, encouraging the adoption of solar pump sets,  George added. Outlining the details of the Kusum C project, the minister said,  To generate 1 MW of electricity under the Kusum C project, 4-5 acres of land are needed. If government land is used, it will be provided free of cost and leased for 25 years. Lessees will pay Rs. 25,000 per acre annually during the lease period. These funds will be deposited in the district collector's account and allocated to develop local anganwadis, schools, and panchayats.  The PM KUSUM initiative, a joint effort of the central and the state governments, was launched to address farmers' energy needs and make agriculture more sustainable. Accelerating transformative energy security for Indian agriculture involves implementing comprehensive strategies to ensure reliable and sustainable energy sources for farmers, said Gaurav Gupta, additional chief secretary, energy department of Karnataka, during the review meeting.  We will select land around substations for this initiative. So far, 27 substations have been chosen, with an additional 12 substations to be selected in the next phase for Tumakuru district. Work has already begun in some substations, and surveys have been conducted. The aim is to benefit farmers with locally generated electricity,  added Gupta. The meeting was also attended by state Home Minister G Parameshwar, who is also the district in-charge minister, cooperation minister K N Rajanna, state government special representative in Delhi T B Jayachandra, MLA K Shadakshari, BESCOM managing director Mahantesh Bilagi and Tumakuru district collector Shubha Kalyan.",

SECI is the nodal agency for implementing the government's renewable energy projects.  There have been solar thermal tenders but not of this scale,  Gupta told reporters on the sidelines of India Energy Storage Week 2024 organised by India Energy Storage Alliance.He added that the concentrated solar thermal capacity project will be based on advanced tech and the pricing will be on a par with other round-the-clock power solutions. Industry officials noted Andhra, Gujarat, or Rajasthan as potential locations for such projects due to high solar radiation reception. 111467729Concentrated solar power technology is widely used internationally.India is aiming for 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Energy storage solutions are required to sustain uninterrupted supply of energy in a grid system dominated by renewable energy sources to cover periods without wind or sunshine. Storage structures are also important to decarbonise the grid. Gupta said SECI is also working on other energy storage solutions.  We are also experimenting with gravity storage and dome structure CO2 storage,  he said, adding that dome structure CO2 storage is promising.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: SECI, a nodal agency for implementing government's renewable energy projects, is expected to float a tender for 500 megawatt (MW) of solar thermal capacity by the end of FY25, its Chairman and Managing Director R P Gupta said on Wednesday. This will be the first time in India that such a tender would be floated on this scale, Gupta told reporters on the sidelines of the India Energy Storage Week 2024, organised by India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) here.   The tender is expected to be out by the end of this financial year 2024-25. There have been (solar thermal) tenders but not of this scale,  Gupta said in reply to a question on new solar thermal tenders.  The earlier tenders were small in size and their costs were also too high, he said.  The projects under the 500-MW tender will have advanced technology where steam would be generated through heat and it would also help in running turbines, he added.  Besides, the prices will be at par with other Round the Clock (RTC) solutions, Gupta said without elaborating further.  The IESW 2024 is dedicated to advancing India's adoption of energy storage, e-mobility, green hydrogen, and other clean technologies in alignment with the country's net zero goal.  Global leaders from battery manufacturing, BESS (battery energy storage system) and EV (electric vehicles) segment gathered at IESW to discuss India's roadmap for advanced battery manufacturing, opportunities and bottlenecks.  Rahul Walawalkar, President & MD, CES India & President, IESA, said that safety is a significant area where  we need to deploy new measures and technologies .  He urged the industry not to compromise on safety as India is moving towards a big vision to scale up its GWh capacity and cannot afford any mistakes.  Akash Kaushik, Founder, GoodEnough Energy, stated that the electricity industry is undergoing significant changes, with a growing need for clean, reliable, and affordable power.  This transformation demands innovative technical solutions and grid optimization strategies that can unlock new revenue streams and optimize energy usage, he added.  Anil Kumar, COO, Nash Energy, said there is a need to develop talent pool in several areas from process to equipment, and skills.  Avishek Kumar, Co-Founder and CEO, VFlowTech, suggested that incentives should be given to new technologies other than traditionally dominant Li-ion batteries.  Further, he said that any regulatory challenges to new battery technologies (differences in GST rates that impact the final battery cost) should be reviewed or made standard for all.  The IESW 2024 showcased emerging and futuristic energy storage solutions including solid-state batteries, lithium sulfur, sodium ion, and other technologies from across the globe.  The event was aimed to facilitate dialogues for Indian battery companies to explore opportunities in the global battery and energy storage market and guide the entry of foreign battery players into the Indian market.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: New energy transition platform Jakson Green on Wednesday said it has inked a pact with state-owned NHPC for the supply of 400 MW solar power. Jakson Green has signed its first Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with NHPC Ltd, a company statement said.  This agreement marks a significant milestone for Jakson Green, solidifying its position as a fast-growing Independent Power Producer (IPP) with a total portfolio of 1 GW under development, the statement added.   We are thrilled to embark on this agreement with NHPC, the first of many more to come. This 400 MW PPA, our largest to date, with NHPC is a monumental achievement for Jakson Green,  Kannan Krishnan, Joint Managing Director, Jakson Green Pvt Ltd said.  This new project will be located in Rajasthan and connected to the central grid, with an expected clean energy generation sufficient to power around four lakh households annually.  Contributing to the elimination of nearly 752,000 MT/year of CO2 emissions, the project will also create valuable job opportunities during construction and operation phases.  In a competitive bidding process conducted by NHPC last year for pan-India CTU connected projects, Jakson Green successfully won 400 MW capacity, securing a favorable tariff of Rs 2.53 per unit. The project is scheduled for commissioning within 24 months of signing the PPA.  The power purchased by NHPC for 25 years is provisioned for sale to discoms.  The PPA was signed between Onkar Yadav, General Manager, NHPC and Kannan Krishnan, Joint MD, Jakson Green in the presence of M K Gupta, Executive Director, NHPC and other senior dignitaries of both companies.  Building on the successful signings of PPAs with Solar Energy Corporation Of India (SECI) and Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd (RUVNL) earlier this year, the 400 MW agreement with NHPC propels Jakson Green to a remarkable 1 GW IPP portfolio.",
