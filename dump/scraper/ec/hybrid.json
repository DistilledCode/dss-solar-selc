The Bhubaneswar-HVIC will produce hydrogen through the electrolyser mode and will be targeting the steel and mobility sectors. Government had invited bids from agencies to form 15 hydrogen valley innovation clusters.ETEnergyWorld earlier reported that the government approved a total funding of Rs 200 crore \u2013 Rs 50 crore each \u2013 for four upcoming green hydrogen valley projects in India over five years.The Department of Science and Technology is supporting four green hydrogen valleys this year, one each in Kerala, Pune, Bhubaneshwar, and Jodhpur. These projects will be upgraded to commercial scale and will be managed by a new Section 8 company for operation sustainability beyond the five-year period.A hydrogen valley is a defined geographical area where hydrogen serves more than one end-sector or application. It covers steps in the hydrogen value chain from production to storage and its transport and distribution to various off-takers.The aim behind setting up such valleys is to boost research, innovation, and capacity of scientific and industrial actors in the area, and demonstrate clean hydrogen solutions with the view to local, regional, and nation-wide deployment.",

We are looking at a short-term horizon. We want to be active in the market in the next 12-18 months,  he said.Bhatia added his venture will part of  rebranding and reimagining its sugar business into a sugar and biochemicals business .  We want to get into ethanol, bio CNG, lactic acids and polylactic solutions all the way up to SAF. Ultimately, we want to look at sugar-associated biomass in addition to other biomass which can contribute to the green transformation in the industry,  said Bhatia.SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduce emissions from air transportation. Feedstocks may include forestry and agricultural waste, used cooking oil, carbon captured from the air, and green hydrogen.While global markets and airlines like Qantas have taken wide leaps in adopting SAF and investing in its production, India is still a nascent player.The Australian carrier's target is for 10% of its fuel use to come from SAF by 2030 and approximately 60% by 2050.India is developing a blueprint for SAF adoption, aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said recently. It plans for 1-5% of commercial flights to use SAF by 2027.Indian Oil Corporation is planning to set up a joint venture with American clean energy tech company LanzaJet and multiple domestic airlines for production of SAF. The venture will set up a plant to make SAF with alcohol-to-jet technology at IOC's refinery in Panipat, Haryana at a cost of \u20b93,000 crore.Thyssenkrupp Industries India is an industrial equipment company providing engineering, procurement and construction services for plant engineering projects mainly in the mining, energy and sugar industries.On May 8, it completed the sale of its industrial business in India. The majority stake in Thyssenkrupp Industries India, held by German's Thyssenkrupp, was sold to the existing co-shareholders Paharpur Cooling Towers and Protos Engineering Co. Bhatia said the cement business will also be a key focus area for the company going forward. He said its capex plans on its various business will be decided under the new owners shortly.",

        "articleBody": "Sacramento (California): One method of making electricity cleanly to address climate change has been quietly advancing and on Tuesday it hit a milestone. A California utility is backing the largest new geothermal power development in the US - 400 megawatts of clean electricity from the Earth's heat - enough for some 4,00,000 homes.  Southern California Edison will purchase the electricity from Fervo Energy, a Houston-based geothermal company, Fervo announced.  The company is drilling up to 125 wells in southwest Utah.  Clean electricity like this reduces the need for traditional power plants that cause climate change. The boost could go a long way toward bringing down the cost of a new generation of geothermal energy, said Wilson Ricks, an energy systems researcher at Princeton University.   If these purchases help to get this technology off the ground, it could be massively impactful for global decarbonization,  he said.  Decarbonization refers to switching out things that produce carbon dioxide and methane, which cause the climate to change, in favor of machines and methods that don't.  Today the world still relies mainly on fossil fuels for round-the-clock power. This new deal shows that clean power can meet a growing demand for electricity, said Sarah Jewett, vice president of strategy at Fervo.   I think that's why it's so exciting. This isn't a niche energy resource going to a niche use,  she said.  And that is something we have not had, you know, readily available  and able to be scaled up.  The first generation of geothermal plants, for example, The Geysers in California, tapped into superheated reservoirs of steam or very hot water close to the Earth's surface. Such reservoirs are relatively rare.  New geothermal companies are adapting drilling technology and practices taken from the oil and gas industry to create reservoirs from hot rock. That unlocks the potential for geothermal energy in many more places.  Engineers have been working to advance the methods for years.  The United States is one of the world leaders in using the Earth's heat to make electricity, but geothermal still accounts for less than half a percent of the nation's total large-scale electricity generation, according to the US Energy Information Administration.  Fervo is pioneering horizontal drilling in geothermal reservoirs. It signed the world's first corporate agreement with Google in 2021 to develop new geothermal power and drilled three wells in Nevada. That project began sending carbon-free electricity onto the Nevada grid in November to power data centers there.  Cape Station, about 200 miles south of Salt Lake City, is expected to start delivering electricity to California as early as 2026.  California Energy Commission Chair David Hochschild said the state is committed to clean, zero-carbon electricity. He said geothermal complements wind and solar farms by providing steady power when it's not windy or sunny, and that is key to ensuring reliability as the state cuts fossil fuels.",

        "articleBody": "India is set to host the International Sugar Organization (ISO) Council Meeting from June 25-27, in the national capital, bringing together delegates from over 30 countries to discuss critical issues in the sugar and biofuel sectors. As the world's largest consumer and second-largest producer of sugar, India has been nominated to chair the ISO for 2024, an official statement said.  The event kicked off with an industrial tour to a grain-based distillery in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, on June 24, demonstrating India's adoption of cutting-edge technology in biofuel production.  The main proceedings begin on June 25 with a workshop titled  Sugar and Biofuels -- Emerging Vistas  at Bharat Mandapam, to be inaugurated by Union Minister for Food as well as New & Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi.  Over 200 delegates, including international representatives, top management from Indian sugar mills, and industry associations, are expected to participate in discussions on the global sugar sector, biofuels, sustainability, and the role of farmers.  The event also aims to bolster the Global Biofuel Alliance, an initiative spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to promote sustainable biofuels worldwide.  Sanjeev Chopra, Secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution, will chair the ISO committee meetings, focusing on administrative and functional aspects of the organization. The program will conclude with cultural tours, including visits to the Red Fort and the Prime Ministers' Museum and Library.  This event not only showcases India's leadership in the sugar and biofuel sectors but also provides a platform for global collaboration on sustainable energy solutions.  With many ISO member countries also part of the Global Biofuel Alliance, the meeting presents an opportunity to expand the alliance and promote biofuels as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The ISO, a UN-affiliated body headquartered in London, brings together 85 member countries representing nearly 90 per cent of global sugar production. Its mandate includes fostering mutual understanding and progressive approaches in addressing issues related to the sugar sector and biofuels.  As the host nation, India aims to present its rich cultural heritage to the international delegates through a cultural program scheduled for the evening of June 25, offering visitors a glimpse into the country's diverse traditions.",

Out of this, 200 GW is already connected, a power ministry statement said.The power evacuation scheme for the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Zone, costing around \u20b912,241 crore, will evacuate 4.5 GW of renewable energy. This comprises 1.0 GW from the Fatehgarh complex, 2.5 GW from the Barmer complex and 1.0 GW from the Nagaur (Merta) complex.The power will be transferred to the Mainpuri region, Fatehpur and Orai in Uttar Pradesh. The completion period of the scheme is two years.The system strengthening scheme of Karnataka will evacuate 4.5 GW from the Koppal and Gadag areas. The scheme will be completed by June 2027 at a cost of about \u20b91,354 crore.Renewable energy sources contributed 71% to the 26 GW of power generation capacity that India added in FY24, according to the Council on Energy, Environment and Water.Nodal agencies with auction responsibility are likely to bid out 50 GW of renewable energy capacity in the ongoing FY25, as is the decided trajectory for each of the five years starting FY24. In the last fiscal year, the agencies auctioned around 51 GW of such capacity, according to an official.India's target of reaching 500 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030 requires an addition of around 44 GW annually, as per a report from Moody's Ratings. To meet the target, India requires $190-215 billion of investment over seven years, it said.Another $150-170 billion investment will be required for electricity transmission and distribution, and energy storage to cater to the incremental renewable energy capacity.Renewable energy, excluding large hydro projects, now contributes 146.65 GW to India's total installed power capacity of 444.8 GW.Renewable energy and electricity transmission are expected to continue to drive investments in the power sector over the next six to seven years, Moody's said in its report.",

Green hydrogen, which is made by splitting hydrogen from water with the help of electrolyzers powered by clean energy, is seen as a potential panacea for decarbonizing the industry as well as transportation.  Speaking at 'Infrastructure - the Catalyst for India's Future' event of Crisil, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani said energy transition and digital infrastructure are trillion-dollar opportunities which will transform India both at a local and at a global scale.   The next decade will see us invest more than USD 100 billion in the energy transition space and further expand our integrated renewable energy value chain that today already spans the manufacturing of every major component required for green energy generation,  he said.  The coal-to-ports group wants to produce the  world's least expensive green electron  that will become the feedstock for several sectors that must meet the sustainability mandate.   And to make this happen, we are already building the world's largest single-site renewable energy park in Khavda, in the district of Kutch (in Gujarat). Just this single location will generate 30 GW of power, thereby taking our total renewable energy capacity to 50 GW by 2030,  he said.  Adani said the energy transition space will fundamentally change the global energy landscape forever.  The global transition market was valued at approximately USD 3 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to nearly USD 6 trillion by 2030, and thereafter double every 10 years till 2050.    As many of you know, in the case of India, our country aims to install 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This ambitious target will require annual investments of over USD 150 billion dollars. The transition to green energy in India is expected to generate millions of new jobs in sectors such as solar and wind, energy storage, hydrogen and its derivatives, EV charging stations, as well as grid infrastructure development,  he said.  On digital infrastructure, he said data is indeed the new oil and at the heart of all the action is the Data Centre - the critical infrastructure needed to power all forms of computational needs, especially AI workloads for machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning.  All of this is dependent on the ability to process data at an unprecedented speed and scale which are the precise capabilities that data centres provide. However, this will need massive amounts of energy, making the data centre business the largest energy consuming industry in the world, he said.   This makes the energy transition even more complex and is raising electricity prices, thereby adding to the already high prices because of the combined impact of climate change and demand growth,  Adani said.  The billionaire said the infrastructure required for energy transition and the infrastructure required for digital transformation are now inseparable as the technology sector becomes the largest consumer of the precious green electrons.  Adani group's digital footprint will span industrial clouds across each of its businesses that it will productize and then take to market, operational technology cybersecurity offerings, super apps to leverage its B2C businesses across wide variety of consumer facing businesses, Artificial Intelligence labs to capitalize on India's fast emerging expertise to provide AI services to the world, and Data Centres that will form the backbone of the energy intensive digital revolution.   In fact, it is anticipated that by the year 2030, the world will need 100 to 150 GW of additional green energy just for the AI data centres. We already have India's largest order book for data centres and are now in discussions for additional gigawatt-scale green AI data centres which we are uniquely positioned to deliver,  he said.",

In a statement, Macawber Beekay Private Ltd (MBL) said it has  bagged three NTPC's Green Coal projects in Noida (Uttar Pradesh), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), and Hubbali (Karnataka) . Green coal is charcoal made using municipal solid waste (MSW) through a thermal treatment process called torrefaction, which is carried out in an oxygen-deficient environment, MBL said. To supply the material, MBL said it will set up three green coal manufacturing units having the capacity to treat 900 tonnes per day (TPD) MSW in Noida, 500 TPD in Bhopal and 400 TPD in Hubbali. This is in addition to a similar project bagged from NTPC in Varanasi earlier, the company said. It aims to complete the three projects by August 2025 in engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode. After completion, the total waste handling capacity of the four projects will reach 2,400 TPD level and produce 800 tonnes of green coal per day for NTPC. The usage of green coal or charcoal will help reduce carbon emissions while generating power.  After successfully demonstration of the technology at NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd in Varanasi, the CPSU has now awarded us more waste to green coal projects. We will be setting up the largest waste-to-green coal plant in Greater Noida, with a capacity of 900 TPD,  Gautam Gupta, Joint Managing Director, Macawber Beekay, said. The Varanasi project has a capacity 600 TPD waste handling capacity and generates 200 tonnes of green coal on a daily basis.

In the last fiscal year, the agencies auctioned around 51 GW of such capacity, according to one of the officials.States and companies could bid out separately for commercial and industrial segments.111066679India's target of reaching 500 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030 requires an addition of around 44 GW annually, as per a latest report from Moody's Ratings. To meet the target, India requires $190-215 billion of investment over seven years, it said.Another $150-170 billion investment will be required for electricity transmission and distribution, and energy storage to cater to the incremental renewable energy capacity.Renewable energy, excluding large hydro projects, now contributes 146.65 GW to India's total installed power capacity of 444.8 GW.Renewable energy and electricity transmission are expected to continue to drive investments in the power sector over the next six to seven years, Moody's said.In the tender mix in the last few months, the share of firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE, where power supply can be programmed based on demand) has picked up since its introduction last year. FDRE is transforming the variable source of renewable energy to a firm and dispatchable source by integrating it with energy storage systems, delivering round-the-clock power.FDRE enables power procurement on a  demand-following  basis, creating a viable alternative to coal, hydro and other dispatchable power-based technologies, JMK Research & Analytics said in February.Since its introduction in mid-2023, more than 90% non-pumped hydro storage tenders issued in India are FDRE.",

Based on the maturity of technology and other logistics consideration, it will chalk out further plans.  By 2027, we propose to be in a position to meet 1% SAF blending for the international sector with SAF production of around 100 tonnes per day.   111066510Last year country's largest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC) signed a memorandum of understanding with LanzaJet to pursue large-capacity SAF production in India using LanzaJet's leading and proven alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology. IOC plans to start the country's first commercial-scale SAF plant at Panipat by 2026. State-run Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals is also setting up a 20-kilolitre-per-day SAF plant. It is using CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum's single-step process that converts used cooking oil or palm waste to produce SAF.BPCL plans to maximise the adoption of indigenous technologies wherever feasible, the company said.  BPCL is evaluating all the three major technology pathways - oil to jet co-processing in an existing facility, oil to jet green field facility, and alcohol to jet new facility. The selection will be based on comprehensive assessments of sustainability, logistical feasibility, and economic viability. The company said it is focused on adopting the most effective technologies that maximise carbon life-cycle benefits, promoting environmental protection within the circular economy framework. While we recognise the presence of domestic technology that is still evolving, our initial evaluations indicate that mature technologies from international players are readily available to enable us to meet the blending mandate within the required time frame. Currently, we are engaged in discussions with multiple agencies across all three pathways,  BPCL said.",

        "articleBody": "Essar Group plans to invest Rs 30,000 crore over the next four years in setting up a green hydrogen plant at Jamnagar in Gujarat as the metals-to-infrastructure conglomerate eyes clean energy as a key pillar for its new phase of growth. The conglomerate is looking to decarbonise its oil refinery in the UK, construct a green steel plant in Saudi Arabia, and build an LNG and electric ecosystem to decarbonise long-haul heavy trucks, Prashant Ruia, director of Essar Capital, which manages the group's portfolio of investments, said.  It is also considering an entry into mining of critical minerals, mainly used in electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind-turbine magnets.  Essar Future Energy plans to develop 1 gigawatt of hydrogen capacity along with associated green molecules capacity of 1 million tonne per annum in Jamnagar over the next four years, he said in an interview with PTI. 110861214  We are going to invest around Rs 30,000 crore (in the green hydrogen project in Jamnagar),  he said.  Essar will use 4.5 GW of renewable energy by a sister concern Essar Renewables to split water molecules to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen, the cleanest known source of energy in the world, so produced can be used to power vehicles, generate electricity, power industry and heat homes and businesses.  Hydrogen, which on burning produces only water, however cannot be shipped and is instead used to make green ammonia which can be easily transported.   The idea is to create green molecules that can be transported directly rather than green ammonia. Because you carry green ammonia and then you convert it into hydrogen. That cost is very high. So we are trying to build a complex which can make green molecules from hydrogen and largely in the biofuels space and export that,  Ruia said.  The conglomerate, which turned debt-free in 2022 after selling some infrastructure assets, will expand its capacity to generate electricity from coal alongside building a renewable energy platform.   The idea is to grow to about 10,000 MW over the next 3-5 years,  he said. 110853514 This includes Essar Power expanding its 1,200 MW Salaya-DevBhoomi Dwarka thermal power plant by an additional 1,600 MW to meet Gujarat's base-load needs.  In the realm of green mobility solutions, Essar is focused on building an LNG and electric ecosystem to decarbonise long-haul heavy trucks, contributing to a cleaner transportation sector, he said.  It has a fleet of 450 to 500 LNG-powered trucks that are used by different industries for their logistics needs, he said.  Trucks are the biggest polluters on the road, producing some 110 tonne of carbon dioxide per truck. There are 4 million trucks in the country and the number are slated to double in the near future.  Replacing diesel in trucks with LNG, helps cut CO2 emissions by 30-35 per cent. Also, gas does not produce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx) which cause acid rain and air pollution.  Alongside, the group also has a fleet of electric trucks.  Emissions from electric vehicles are zero.   So what we're trying, if you take the combination of the two you can reduce about 60-70 per cent of the CO2,  he said. 110988156 Essar is also building a retail network to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to trucks, he said adding LNG-powered trucks can run for 1,300-1,400 kilometers on a full tank while electric trucks have a range of around 150-km.   So short-range is electric and longer range can be LNG,  he said.  Besides, the group is producing gas from coal seams from a block in West Bengal, he said.  Its arm, Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Limited (EOGEPL), India's leader in the coal bed methane industry, contributes nearly 65 per cent of the country's total coal bed methane production and aims to increase its contribution to India's total gas production to 5 per cent within the next five years.  Gas produced from coal-seams, called coal-bed methane, can be used as CNG for running automobiles as well as generating electricity and making fertilizer.   We are today India's largest CBM player. We do about a million cubic meters of gas per day which is very small,  he said.  Our idea is to grow that so we are investing Rs 2,000-3,000 crore to increase the gas-based portfolio.   The firm is also exploring for shale gas in the Raniganj CBM block in West Bengal. 110890737  India has not yet had a commercial success shale. We all know the revolution in the US because of shale. So we feel that there are some opportunities there. We are going to explore that... so please do not get excited yet but we are trying,  he said.  Essar plans to invest USD 3.6 billion to decarbonize its Stanlow refinery in the UK and another USD 4 billion to set up a green steel plant, which will use hydrogen, in Saudi Arabia.",

We are adding about 600-700 megawatts a year as we see growth like never before in terms of customer adoption of green energy,  said Kuldeep Jain, the company\u2019s founder and managing director.Jain, who founded CleanMax in 2011, said the current operational capacity is at 2,200 MW, of which 1,750 MW is owned by the company.  In two years, the owned balance sheet capacity will exceed 3000 MW. Demand for green power is booming as companies rush to become carbon neutral. Additionally, since green power is 35% cheaper than conventional power, it significantly lowers the cost burden for companies.Jain said demand for green power is exponential among tech companies, manufacturing companies, data centres, and global capability centres.CleanMax also offers customised sustainability solutions to corporates such as producing green energy from wind and solar farms, rooftop solar projects, renewable energy certificates, and high-quality carbon projects.  We have a new carbon business and are also investing in nature-based business solutions which will capture carbon, and carbon credits generated through that will be sold to corporates,  added Jain.This April, Apple Inc., the creator of iPhones, said it has invested in setting up more than 14 MW of rooftop solar capacities across its six industrial sites in India through CleanMax. These installations are expected to mitigate around 207,000 tons of CO2 emissions through their operational life. Apple aims to become carbon neutral across its entire value chain by the end of this decade.CleanMax, which has set up more than 1,000 solar rooftop projects so far, is bullish on the segment. Its clientele spans across India, Thailand, Bahrain, Dubai, and the UAE.  We see the rooftop solar business segment growing very well and very fast all over the world for us,  said Jain.",

        "articleBody": "Japan, a major coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyer, could be energy-independent by 2060 thanks to expansion of solar and wind power together with storage batteries, said Jarand Rystad, chief executive of the Rystad Energy consultancy. Japan imports most of its energy resources, with the Middle East, Australia and the United States being its top suppliers. The government's strategy calls for a reduction in LNG and coal to under 40% of the power generation mix by 2030 from more than 60% now. But analysts say Japan is moving slower it needs to.  Japan's mindset is that we have to import energy because we have no energy ourselves. But with the development in renewable energy technologies, I think that statement doesn't need to be true,  Rystad told Reuters. According to Rystad, Japan could be energy-sufficient by having 45% of solar power, 30% of wind generation led by offshore farms, 5% of hydropower, another 5% of biomass and e-fuel with nuclear power providing the remaining 15%, by 2060.  All Japan needs is to continue installing as much solar as it did in the years before 2020. From 2014, you installed between 10 and 12 gigawatts on the peak,  Rystad said. Japan installed about 4 GW of new solar capacity last year, with its total outstanding solar capacity reaching 87 GW, the world's third biggest behind China and the United States. Rystad said mixing agriculture with solar panels - which also provide the shade preferred by some types of crops - as well as solar rooftops above roads, among other solutions, could help to expand the use of such power.  The combination of offshore and onshore wind and solar, geothermal and biomass with solid backup from both battery and pumped hydro, should actually enable Japan to see self-dependency in energy in 40 years, or by 2060 even,  he said.

The proposed deal may have an enterprise value of $500 million (\u20b94,100 crore), the sources said.The portfolio of Enel Green Power India comprises 760 megawatts (MW) of operational wind and solar power assets and a development pipeline of 2 gigawatts (GW). Of the operational capacity, solar power projects comprise 420 MW, with the balance 340 MW coming from wind power.110854118Last year, Norwegian Climate Investment Fund, managed by Norfund, and KLP, Norway's largest pension company, had together committed $100 million of equity and guarantees for a 168 MW wind power plant developed by Enel Green Power in India.In 2020, Norfund and Enel Green Power (EGP) entered into a joint investment agreement for renewable energy projects in India. Their first project together, the 420 MW Thar solar plant, was announced in 2022. Enel Green Power, founded in 2008 within the Enel Group to develop and manage renewable power projects globally, operates over 63 GW of installed renewable capacity at 1,300 plants in Asia, Europe, Africa and America. EGP had strengthened its position in India through an acquisition of a majority stake in renewable energy company BLP Energy for \u20b930 million (\u20b9220 crore) in 2015.Enel, ONGC, Masdar and Sekura Energy spokespersons declined to comment. JSW, Sembcorp and Torrent didn't respond to queries. Energy producers such as Sekura Energy, Sembcorp and Masdar Energy are already in the race for several Indian renewable assets that are on the block. These three were among the contenders for the 2 GW renewable portfolio of Brookfield in India that's up for sale at an estimated enterprise value of $800 million-1 billion (\u20b96,600-8,300 crore). JSW Neo Energy and Sekura Energy are among the bidders that have made non-binding offers to acquire a controlling stake in Ayana Renewable Power, majority owned by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), at a valuation of about $2 billion, ET had reported.ONGC is another contender for several assets in the clean energy space as part of decarbonising its operations. ONGC plans to have a renewable energy capacity of 10 GW by 2030 at an investment of \u20b91 lakh crore. The outlook for the renewable energy (RE) sector remains stable, led by strong policy support from the government, superior tariff competitiveness and sustainability initiatives by large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers.

The company could explore production at its upcoming green hydrogen hub at Pudimadaka in Andhra Pradesh. However, the location is not finalised yet, one of the persons said. NTPC Green Energy Ltd, the company's arm, will build the facility, the people said.The move to produce sustainable jet fuel will mark a significant step in NTPC's transition towards green energy and reducing its carbon footprint. NTPC is exploring Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as one of the potential avenues for CO2 utilisation pathway through its ongoing research and development effort on CCUS [carbon capture utilization and storage],  the company said in response to email queries.The company said in its reply that while it was exploring foray into clean jet fuel production, it was too early to comment on the size, cost, and location of the new facility. NTPC Green Energy may get publicly listed by December, as reported earlier by ET.The company plans to capture carbon dioxide, using CCUS technology, from its thermal plant chimney while green hydrogen will be produced through renewable energy sources. Both gases will be synthesised in the reactor to make jet fuel. Both gases will be combined at a synthetic fuel production unit with the Fischer Tropsch process to make jet fuel.NTPC Green Energy will be investing \u20b970,000 crore to build the Andhra Pradesh facility for producing the fuel and its derivatives besides manufacturing renewable energy-related components and systems, said the people cited above.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, heading into his third term with a weakened mandate, wants India to embrace a new \u201cgreen era\u201d at the forefront of climate diplomacy and clean technology.To succeed, he\u2019ll need to balance those ambitions against a need to sustain growth and satisfy rapidly accelerating electricity demand, leaning on a fraying power system still heavily dependent on coal.Modi, who has cast himself as climate champion for much of the past decade, will be under pressure to make faster progress toward existing green targets, including pledges to hit net zero by 2070, install a mammoth 500 gigawatts of non-fossil energy by the end of the decade, and corral a global alliance on solar power that aims to secure $1 trillion in investment.But significant expansion in clean energy \u2014 India added over 100 GW of renewable capacity during past 10 years of Modi\u2019s government \u2014 has not been enough to satisfy steep demand growth and the limitations of the country\u2019s transmission and distribution networks. 110830332With energy security a priority, coal still accounts for roughly three-quarters of output today and its use continues to rise. India plans to add close to 90 GW of coal projects by 2032 \u2014 about 63% more than the existing blueprint, published in May 2023.New Delhi has expanded coal mining to a record, extended the lives of power plants and pressed for the softening of language around fossil fuels at international climate talks. State miner Coal India Ltd., which until the pandemic was planning to diversify into solar power, is now prioritizing the spending of record sums to expand fossil fuel output.This is unlikely to ease under a new government.According to Ashwini Swain, fellow at New Delhi-based research organization Sustainable Futures Collaborative, a more fragile and fractious coalition could be prompted to push for projects that spread largesse and earn political support. \u201cProtecting the fossil ecosystem may seem to be aligned with the objective,\u201d he said.Of course, India\u2019s green ambition is real and the country, among the most climate-vulnerable globally, has been experiencing more frequent instances of extreme heat and drought.A pro-poor, pro-growth agenda does not need to rely on coal, which has shown itself to be costlier and less reliable than cleaner alternatives, said independent power analyst Alexander Rutter, who is based in Bengaluru. \u201cThere is a real opportunity for the new government to radically rethink its strategy by doubling down on renewable energy and storage rather than on investments in new, uneconomic and unreliable coal plants,\u201d he said.But the investment requirements are steep, especially when it comes to infrastructure changes that will underpin a transition, from overhauling mobility in sprawling cities to power networks. In 2022, India\u2019s electricity planners calculated that in order to reach India\u2019s renewable goals, the cost of laying new cables alone would be around 2.4 trillion rupees ($29 billion).Renewable projects are still often built in barren areas, far from demand centers in cities and industrial hubs, where the power is consumed.Meanwhile, the fragile financial health of distribution companies connecting homes or factories regularly deprive them of reliable supplies. A 3-trillion rupee project led by the power ministry will go some way to fixing profitability, thanks to initiatives like smart metering, but progress is slow. 110830326One potential change for the next five years will be the role of local parties, which may ease centralization and bring regional interests up the agenda, climate analysts and researchers said \u2014 and that includes spreading green manufacturing and clean energy benefits.\u201cA coalition government should allow more states to make claims on the growing green economy in India,\u201d said Rohit Chandra, assistant professor at the IIT Delhi School of Public Policy. \u201cThe last decade saw most of this activity in four or five states, including Gujarat and Rajasthan.\u201dThose two states \u2014 also bastions of support for Modi\u2019s party \u2014 do enjoy the lowest cost of energy generation, but poorer regions will now have a greater political role, potentially pulling investments to less affluent areas.\u201cIf we see more decentralization and more state-led growth, you could see some of these transition policies being intertwined with bread and butter economic aspirations, including health and education,\u201d said Shayak Sengupta, energy and climate fellow with the Climate at Observer Research Foundation America.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s power sector investments will be driven by renewable energy and transmission projects which will require an investment of $340-385 billion to meet the government's target and associated incremental transmission and storage system, Moody\u2019s Ratings said on Thursday.India's target of 500GW renewable energy capacity by 2030 requires an annual capacity addition of around 44 GW. To meet these targets, India will require $190 billion to $215 billion of investment over the next seven years, it said. The ratings agency estimates another $150-170 billion investment required for electricity transmission and distribution and energy storage for incremental renewable energy capacity.The sizable pipelines of announced projects will likely keep financial leverage of rated renewable power companies high over the next two to three years, a credit negative, but leverage of government related issuers is likely to remain moderate over the same period, it said.Coal-based units will continue to play a key role in power generation despite the huge renewable energy capacity expansion.While the growth momentum in renewable energy capacity is likely to continue, coal will remain an important source of electricity in the next 8-10 years, which mitigates stranding risks for coal-based power assets, it said.\u201cWe expect India to add 40-50 GW of coal-based capacity over the next five to six years to help meet power demand, which is likely to grow by 5%-6% annually over this period,\u201d it added.The utilization rate for coal-based capacity is likely to remain high at around 65%-70% despite the capacity additions.Stable regulations and policy framework will support power companies implementing carbon transition, the agency said, adding that strong policy support has helped India increase the share of renewable energy in its power capacity mix to around 43% in FY24. Continued policy support will help India make significant progress toward its 2030 transition targets and 2070 net-zero targets, the agency said. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission\u2019s tariff regulations for 2024-2029 has provided clarity on returns and cost pass-through mechanisms for generators. The regulatory consistency helps power companies transition toward cleaner energy while maintaining profitability, it said.",

In line with its renewable energy plan, the car market leader has commenced production at its biogas plant at its Manesar facility by harnessing the untapped potential of in-house food waste and Napier grass as resources at its plant. The initiative is in alignment with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy\u2019s \u2018Waste to Energy\u2019 program, it said. The learning from this pilot will be implemented at the company\u2019s upcoming manufacturing facilities.Maruti plans to double production capacity to four million units by 2031. In the works are the two greenfield manufacturing sites -- first in Kharkhoda, Haryana and the second one in Gujarat.The pilot biogas plant Manesar is designed to produce 0.2 tons of biogas daily. The anticipated output is about 1 lac standard cubic meters of biogas in 2024-25. It will offset approximately 190 tonnes of CO2 per annum. Imbibing principles of circularity, the company will be using food waste from canteens and Napier grass as raw materials. The pilot biogas plant will provide energy for the manufacturing processes of the company's Manesar facility. The residual organic manure will be utilized in horticulture effectively making it a zero-discharge model. \u201cEnergy is one of the critical inputs in the manufacturing process. As we ramp up our production capacity from around 2 million to 4 million by 2030-31, we are also accelerating our efforts to increase the share of sustainable and renewable energy sources across our operations. This is in line with Suzuki\u2019s Environment Vision 2050 and Govt of India\u2019s renewable energy focus,\u201d Hisashi Takeuchi, Managing Director & CEO, Maruti Suzuki India said in the statement. The biogas plant at Manesar is another step towards fostering a cleaner and more sustainable energy landscape at the company and the industry at large, he said. Just as Maruti is bringing multiple technologies in its products, it would also focus on multiple renewable energy sources to make its operations greener, he saidMaruti has been strategically investing in its existing and upcoming facilities to ensure they are environmentally sustainable by optimizing energy consumption, integrating renewable energy sources, implementing efficient waste management protocols, and conserving water resources, he added. Meanwhile, the local arm of the Japanese carmaker is ramping up its solar capacity at Manesar and Kharkhoda factory as part of the plan to transition to green manufacturing practices at its Manesar and Kharkhoda facilities. It expanded its solar capacity to 43.2 MWp in the fiscal year 2023-24 and is on track to add 15 MWp solar capacity to its Manesar plant and 20 MWp to the upcoming Kharkhoda plant over the next two years. This will boost the total solar capacity to reach 78.2 MWp by the fiscal year 2025-26. These initiatives are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, the company said.",

        "articleBody": "Indian battery materials producer Altmin is in talks with the Australian government to secure lithium supplies, the company's managing director said, as part of its expansion plans to meet rising demand for the critical mineral.  We are talking to the Australian High Commission and the critical minerals office,  Anjani Sri Mourya Sunkavalli told Reuters. Altmin, India's only cathode active materials producer, currently sources lithium carbonate from Brazil and Bolivia. Last year, Altmin signed a deal with Bolivia's state-owned Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) to set up a plant to produce lithium iron phosphate materials in the South American country. Altmin later plans to bring in lithium carbonate from YLB's Bolivia plant for its operations in India. The company is also exploring the possibility of setting up lithium refineries in Brazil and Australia, Sunkavalli said. In the absence of lithium processing facilities in India, New Delhi is offering incentives to encourage private companies to set them up locally, Reuters reported earlier this month. Sunkavalli said he would also try to explore whether Altmin could secure supplies of spodumene, a mineral with a high concentration of lithium, from Brazil. The company plans to set up a cathode active materials plant by 2025 in India's southern city of Hyderabad, and it would source lithium carbonate from both Brazil and Bolivia for the planned unit, Sunkavalli said. Altmin is in the process of raising 3-4 billion rupees ($36-$48 million) from sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors in the next two to three months to fund its expansion plans, Sunkavalli said.

        "articleBody": "The renewable energy unit of billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s empire is at risk of missing key growth targets unless it resorts to a share issue to consolidate its finances, according to a report by Snowcap Research. Adani Green Energy Ltd., a company within the sprawling conglomerate of India\u2019s second-richest man, is falling short of its stated return targets, London-based Snowcap said in a 51-page report on Thursday. The lower returns, coupled with rising debt-financing costs, mean the firm may not have sufficient funding to meet its 2030 renewable energy goal.The company \u201ccan meet just 50% of its 50GW target funding requirement by 2030 without raising equity, despite claiming this target is \u2018fully funded\u2019,\u201d Snowcap said. It added that Adani Green isn\u2019t meeting a target announced in 2021 of returning 17% on capital through 2025. Based on Snowcap\u2019s analysis, Adani Green more likely delivered an 11-12% return on capital on projects completed over the past three years \u2014 in line with the company\u2019s peers \u2014 at a 9.5% cost of debt.A representative for Adani Green said the company \u201ccategorically rejects\u201d the analysis published by Snowcap. \u2018False Allegations\u2019\u201cThe report is baseless, factually inaccurate, and contains analytical errors and false allegations, all intended to negatively impact\u201d the company\u2019s share price, the representative said, adding that management stands by its public disclosures.Adani Green\u2019s shares fell as much as 2.2% in Mumbai after the report was published but erased some of those losses soon after. The flagship for the group, Adani Enterprises Ltd., slipped as much as 2.6% on Thursday.Snowcap\u2019s criticism comes more than a year after the Adani Group was jolted by allegations brought by short-seller Hindenburg Research. The US-based firm\u2019s accusations of corruption and market manipulation initially wiped more than $150 billion off the Adani Group\u2019s market value. Adani has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and those stock losses have largely been recouped.Snowcap says it holds no positions in or against Adani Green, which is roughly 56% owned by units controlled by Gautam Adani, while TotalEnergies SE holds about 20%. The short-seller, which is run by brothers Henry and Chris Kinnersley, says limited liquidity combined with regulatory hurdles in India make it hard to place a contrarian bet. What Adani Green SaysThe company has \u201cstrong equity capital access with leading international investors,\u201d including TotalEnergies, GQG Partners and Qatar Investment Authority, it said in its comment to Bloomberg News.Adani Green has raised equity investments of over $5 billion since April 2020 and project financing of more than $3.4 billion, the company said.\u201cThe deep interest by long-term investors, strategic partners, financial institutions, and banks, coupled with continued promoter commitment, gives assurance that AGEL will achieve its target of 50 GW of renewable capacity by 2030,\u201d Adani Green said.India, the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has set a target to triple non-fossil capacity by 2030. The country says it\u2019s undergoing the world\u2019s largest expansion plan in renewable energy, and companies that are seen to be helping it achieve these goals gain access to a range of state incentives. In the Khavda region of Gujarat state, Adani Green is building the world\u2019s largest renewables park, a 30 gigawatt project. As India\u2019s biggest renewable energy company, any setback in its ambitious plans could jeopardize the country\u2019s green push. In early May, Adani Green said its fourth-quarter profit dropped 70% from a year earlier, though it said that was in large part due to exchange-rate effects.The company has managed to attract a number of investors with sustainable mandates to its bond auctions. Robeco Institutional Asset Management BV and the investment arm of Banque Lombard Odier & Cie SA were among buyers of a green bond earlier this year, through which Adani Green and associated firms raised more than $400 million.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has upgraded Adani Green Energy Ltd's long-term issuer rating to 'IND AA-' from 'IND A+' with stable outlook.  The upgrade factors in the continued strong operational asset performance, strong execution scale-up, with annual capacity additions likely to be 4GW-5GW annually over the medium term from the earlier 2.5-3.5GW; and healthy counterparty diversification and reduction in receivables, leading to an increase in the (cash flow from operations - interest)/EBITDA conversion compared to historical levels,  a statement said.  The upgrade also reflects Adani Green Energy Ltd's (AGEL) change in policy with respect to the leveraging of the holding company, as the company has now earmarked funds towards the repayment of USD 750 million holding company bond.   In addition, the upgrade factors in the creation of a platform within AGEL with Total Energies SE, which allows for part asset monetisation while retaining consolidation benefits, the equity infusion by the promoters through warrants, of which 25 per cent has already been received, and the continued ability of the company to tie up both debt and raise equity to ensure fully funded under-construction portfolio,  it said.  The ratings also reflect Ind-Ra's expectation of favourable operational to under-construction book ratio, given the operational capacity of nearly 10.9 GW, and an increase in annual capacity addition targets to 5GW.  It also takes into account the amortising structure of the debt as against bulleted structures earlier, which ensure amortisation of debt, leading to 15 per cent tail life for the projects, thus lowering the refinance and tail risks.  The above factors have jointly contributed to a moderation in the leverage to more reasonable levels of 5.5-6.5x from the historically high levels of 9.0x.   The ratings continues to factor in AGEL's robust execution track record; the strong operational performance of its assets with plant load factors (PLFs) between P50-P90 levels of the operational assets,  it said.  Also, Ind-Ra factors in healthy diversification among counterparties, with majority of counterparties belonging to highest credit quality; portfolio diversification achieved both geographically and in generation sources across wind and solar; and healthy cash upstreaming from the operating SPVs when the restricted covenants are met, thus allowing for debt servicing at the holding company.  AGEL's strengths included it being the largest renewable developer in India with sound operating parameters of operational assets with healthy free cash flow to equity.  This coupled with the balance promoter warrant money infusion of Rs 7,000 crore over FY25-FY26 and equity investment from investors would ensure adequate availability of equity for the under-construction portfolio.  Ind-Ra expects the annual capex run rate to be stepped up to Rs 24,000-30,000 crore over FY25-FY27 from about Rs 16,000 crore in FY24. The same would entail an annual equity requirement of Rs 18,000 crore over FY25-FY27, of which nearly Rs 7,000 crore would be promoter funds, Rs 8,500-11,000 crore would be internally generated and the balance could be generated from the equity program.",

Green hydrogen producers will get cheaper equipment with duty benefit. The industry had been demanding this for some time,  a government official said.The notification was issued with prior approval from the Election Commission of India, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy Secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla told ET. The government reimposed restrictions on import of solar modules from this financial year after a relaxation in the last because of insufficient domestic capacity.110508942It had earlier exempted solar projects commissioned by March 31, 2024, from the mandatory requirement of procuring solar modules from the approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) for 2023-24. The mandate, introduced in 2021, required solar project developers to buy modules from the approved list as a non-tariff barrier to boost domestic manufacturing. Similarly, the revised list of models and manufacturers is the list of type and quality certified wind turbine models eligible for installation in the country. The exemption is no different from any other SEZ benefits and was anticipated,  said Sujoy Ghosh, managing director-India, First Solar.The National Green Hydrogen Mission aims to develop green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 million tonnes per year with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country.",

        "articleBody": "Tokyo:  An engine reborn.  That's how Japanese automaker Toyota introduced plans to cast a futuristic spin on the traditional internal combustion engine. During a three-hour presentation at a Tokyo hall Tuesday, the car manufacturer giant announced it would offer lean compact engines that also run on so-called green fuels like hydrogen and bioethanol, or get paired with zero-emissions electric motors in hybrids. This comes as many competitors in the auto industry are pushing for fully electric vehicles. China is revving its push for Battery Electric Vehicles, and its own BYD is threatening to outshine Tesla in that push. Toyota's Chief Executive Koji Sato said the  engine is optimised for the electrification era  with hopes of helping push the world into  carbon neutrality.  Toyota already has a well-known hybrid car - the Prius - with a gas engine and an electric motor. It switches between the two to deliver a cleaner drive. In future hybrids, the electric motor is set to become the main driving power, and the new engine will be designed to take a lesser role and help it along, according to Toyota. Domestic allies Subaru Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., both preparing ecological engines designed to meet the inevitably upcoming stringent emissions standards, joined Toyota 's presentation billed as a  multi-pathway workshop.   Each company wants to win, but we can be faster if we work together,  said Sato. But details on when the engines were coming to market weren't disclosed. The legacy of the car engine could be felt everywhere. Mazda said that its prized rotary engine, introduced more than 50 years ago, was being adapted for electric vehicles. Subaru, meanwhile, showcased its trademark smaller horizontally opposed engine. While Chief Technology Officer Tetsuro Fujinuki confirmed the company was working on a great  Subaru-like  electric vehicle, he said the company wasn't about to dump the engine altogether. Toyota, too, is working on stylish BEVs. The executives said Tuesday that energy supply conditions differed globally, adding that products had to meet various customer needs and the investments needed for mass-producing BEVS were enormous. Toyota officials also repeatedly noted that 5.5 million jobs were at stake in the overall supply chain for vehicle production in Japan nowadays, so a sudden shift to electric cars wasn't economically possible or socially responsible. Takahiro Fujimoto, a professor of business at Waseda University, believes electric vehicles are a key solution for reducing emissions. But they still have weak points, such as large amounts of emissions produced while making lithium-ion batteries, a chief component. In Japan, for instance, commuters use trains, so that may be a better ecological choice for transportation, Fujimoto said.  At the very least, I believe the proliferation of and innovations in BEVs are definitely needed. But that argument is logically not the same as saying that all we need are BEVs,  he said. Uncertainties remain, spanning research and development, as well as social, political and market conditions, said Fujimoto.  The carbon neutrality the world is aspiring toward isn't likely attainable for decades to come. It's going to be a long marathon race,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "India is positioning itself as a key player in the renewable ammonia market with several international trade agreements already inked and more on the horizon.According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, however, industry insiders emphasize the need for greater policy clarity and price stability to transform these agreements into binding deals.The country's ambition to produce 5 million metric tons (mt) of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and secure a 10 per cent share of the global trade by that time underscores its commitment to renewable energy.ACME-IHI and ReNew-Jera are among the leading entities that have entered into non-binding supply agreements for renewable ammonia.According to analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights, more such agreements are likely to follow, serving as guiding lights for companies in securing financing and finalizing engineering, procurement, and construction contracts.These agreements are crucial in the early commercial stages of development.India's renewable energy sector benefits from various incentives, including cheap power, subsidies, low-cost loans, and readily available land, provided by federal and state governments.These incentives are instrumental in accelerating large-scale projects, with exports expected to commence around 2027.However, concerns linger regarding the consistency of government policies amidst the nation's escalating domestic energy demands, leading to some scepticism among developers regarding export prospects.While India boasts nearly 100 renewable or low-carbon hydrogen projects with a combined capacity of 7.85 million mt, the challenge lies in finding a market for its renewable ammonia.The Japanese and South Korean markets, traditionally reliant on low-carbon ammonia produced using fossil fuels with carbon capture, present stiff competition. The distinction between  clean  and  green  hydrogen/ammonia further complicates matters, with subsidies in these markets favouring low-carbon options.Despite these challenges, India's renewable hydrogen/ammonia is expected to remain competitive globally due to its cost advantages.The National Green Hydrogen Mission 2023, which waives interstate transmission charges for renewable energy and offers substantial subsidies, plays a pivotal role in driving down production costs.Moreover, India enjoys a significant transport cost advantage over the Middle East in supplying to North Asia, further enhancing its competitiveness.Industry leaders expressed confidence in India's ability to meet stringent European requirements for renewable fuels at a fraction of the cost incurred elsewhere.Mahesh Kolli, President and Joint Managing Director of Greenko, highlights India's potential to produce renewable hydrogen at a significantly lower cost, even without subsidies, compared to other markets.Kolli said,  To meet the standards, the renewable hydrogen cost in most countries in Europe and other markets is touching close to USD 8-USD 10/kg ... In India, we can achieve all this in USD 3-USD 4/kg range and that too without subsidies. ",

The 10-megawatt proton exchange membrane electrolyser for the green-hydrogen producing unit at the Vijaipur complex has been imported from Canada.  The plant will produce about 4.3 tonnes of green hydrogen per day, with a purity of about 99.999 per cent by volume. It uses electricity produced from renewable sources such as the sun's solar energy, to split water to produce green hydrogen.  In a statement, GAIL said the plant was in line with the National Green Hydrogen mission that has set out a goal of 5 million tons of annual green hydrogen production capacity for the country by 2030.  India is putting increased focus on hydrogen as an alternative fuel source to lower its carbon emissions, while also meeting its growing energy needs.   Initially the hydrogen produced from this unit shall be used as a fuel along with natural gas for captive purpose in the various processes and equipment running in the existing plant at Vijaipur,  it said.  Further, this hydrogen is planned to be dispensed to retail customers in the nearby geographies, transported through high pressure cascades.   Besides sourcing renewable power through open access, GAIL is also setting up around 20 MW Solar power plants at Vijaipur (both ground mounted and floating) to meet the requirement of green power for the 10 MW PEM Electrolyzer.  While GAIL is blending hydrogen with natural gas on an experimental basis in Indore in its CGD (city gas distribution) network to test its success, it aims to escalate blending ratios with after necessary approvals based on the test results.  Current regulations provide for blending only 5 per cent hydrogen with natural gas. GAIL is conducting joint studies with Engineers India Limited and IIT Kanpur to further blend hydrogen with natural gas.",

India\u2019s largest local currency loan so for this year was Assam Bio Refinery Pvt.\u2019s deal of $365 million in February. If Tata Power\u2019s planned borrowing finalizes with a size anywhere near $1 billion, it would take that title.The proceeds of the loan will be used to fund the company\u2019s investment of $1.6 billion announced in August to develop some clean energy projects known as pumped hydro storage, the people familiar said.India aims to nearly triple its green power capacity by the end of the decade and firms including Tata Power, Adani Green Energy Ltd. and Reliance Industries Ltd. are ramping up such efforts. Tata Power is targeting a near fourfold growth in its renewable generation capacity by 2027. The deal may be a bilateral loan or a clubbed facility. The company expects to finalize credit lines with lenders in the next three to six months, after which disbursements will take place in tranches depending on project development, the people said. The loan may be priced over local gauges such as the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s repo rate or treasury bills, they added. Negotiations are ongoing and details of the deal may change.Tata Power and the banks mentioned didn\u2019t respond to requests seeking comments.",

The kingdom aims to shift rapidly to a larger share of renewables in the power grid, with the goal of generating half of its power from clean sources by 2030. The projects, developed by Japan's Marubeni Corp, benefit from state backing and favorable wind conditions in the country, making them more cost-effective than fossil fuel alternatives. The country's move towards renewable energy is part of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's efforts to diversify the economy away from oil dependence. ",

        "articleBody": "Saudi Arabia signed deals to buy electricity from two large-scale wind farms that are cheaper than natural gas plants, as it aims to rapidly transition to a bigger share of renewables in the power grid. The state-run Saudi Power Procurement Co. this week said it had agreed to purchase power at record-low prices from the wind projects to be developed in the kingdom by Japan\u2019s Marubeni Corp. A combination of state backing and strong wind conditions in the country will help make the green power plants cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives, the head of the Saudi company said.\u201cWhat\u2019s unique about these projects is they\u2019ve achieved extremely low cost of electricity that is considered the lowest we\u2019ve seen globally,\u201d Mazin Albahkali, chief executive officer of SPPC, said in an interview. \u201cAchieving extremely low tariffs on renewables is definitely helping reduce the cost of power generation in Saudi Arabia.\u201dSaudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, has been a laggard in renewable power generation and gets the vast majority of its electricity from plants that burn oil and gas. But that\u2019s starting to change as Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman looks to increasingly pivot the economy away from its dependence on oil. The country has a goal to generate half of its power from clean sources by the end of this decade, up from less than 1% in 2022, according to data from BloombergNEF.While it\u2019s not clear if Riyadh will reach that goal, the country is rapidly growing its fleet of solar farms and wind parks. By 2030, over 45 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity are likely to be installed, more than 13 times the level at the end of last year, according to BNEF data. That would also free up more of its vast oil output for exports.  110358859The appeal of renewables is at least partly the cost. SPPC said that the deal with Marubeni, which is developing the wind farms with a local partner, will ensure a levelized cost of energy of as little as 1.57 cents per kilowatt-hour from the 600-megawatt AlGhat project. The plant is set to be the country\u2019s biggest when completed in 2026. Marubeni is also building the 500-megawatt Wa\u2019ad Alshamal project, which will produce wind power at a cost of 1.70 cents a kilowatt-hour. While it\u2019s not possible to exactly compare variable renewable generation to gas plants on the grid, the cost is cheaper than the fossil fuels, Albahkali said.Those low prices are helped by favorable conditions provided by the Saudi state.\u201cWe provide the land, we provide wind speed data, we provide the permits and support them with further permits and we guarantee the power offtake,\u201d Albahkali said. \u201cA lot of risks built into projects are removed here.\u201dSPPC also has a strong credit rating, making it a strong counter party that helps project developers get cheaper financing, he said. In addition, the wind farm project developers plan to use Chinese wind turbines, which are much cheaper than ones made in the US or Europe. ",

The renewable energy company, founded by IIM Ahmedabad classmates Arvind Bansal and Vikash Saraf, has signed a term sheet with Global Environment Fund and UK-based Just Climate to raise $150 million, they said. The funding from the two investors will help set a valuation benchmark before the IPO. The development comes within days of the founders raising their stake in Continuum Green Energy Ltd (CGEL), Singapore, by acquiring shares from Morgan Stanley. CGEL holds 100% of Continuum Green Energy (India). Morgan Stanley\u2019s stake fell to 26% from 83%. The founders now own 74% of CGEL. 110342047Continuum Green Energy (India) could file a draft prospectus for an IPO as soon as July, company executives told bondholders on a call on Monday. It plans to raise around $400 million from the offering, said people aware of the matter. The rejig that resulted in the founders raising their stake was agreed on May 11, the company told the bondholders.Continuum Green Energy (India) and Global Environment Fund didn\u2019t respond to queries. Just Climate declined to comment. The founders in their personal capacity separately raised $230 million to finance the purchase of additional stakes in CGEL from Morgan Stanley. This was done through the founders\u2019 Singapore-based investment company Continuum Energy Pte Ltd (CEPL), which sold bonds on May 20 to investors such as BlackRock, Deutsche Bank and KKR. CEPL raised a threeyear bond at a 12.85% coupon, which includes a 5% cash component. The bonds were secured by the 74% stake held by the founders. CGEL\u2019s equity is now valued at $850 million, the bondholders were informed. The promoters may sell a minority stake in CGEL if the IPO of its subsidiary is delayed, the company told them. Continuum Green Energy (India) has ramped up its portfolio of operating wind and solar power plants since operations began in 2009. It has operating power plants that produce over 1 gigawatt of electricity. It also has projects with an energy producing capacity of 2.5 GW in the pipeline. It owns and operates India\u2019s largest wind-solar, co-located hybrid project in Tamil Nadu that has a capacity of 226.8 MW and is in the process of building a similar 250 MW wind-solar hybrid project in Gujarat. North Haven Infrastructure Partners, a global infrastructure fund managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, invested $212 million in Continuum Energy in 2012. Global Environment Fund and Just Climate invest in companies and technologies that reduce carbon emissions and help mitigate the impacts of climate change. For instance, Global Environment Fund has in the past invested in green energy producing companies such as ReNew Power and Greenko. Just Climate is an investor in Swiss electrification and automation giant ABB\u2019s emobility division which makes EV chargers and charging infrastructure.",

        "articleBody": "Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is in talks to form a consortium with NTPC Green Energy to bid for National Investment and Infrastructure Fund-owned Ayana Renewable Power, according to people aware of the matter. They said ONGC and NTPC Green Energy may explore a joint offer or the former could bid solo. Ayana\u2019s enterprise value has been pegged at about $2 billion. JSW Neo Energy, Sekura Energy, Masdar, Macquarie and Sembcorp have submitted non-binding offers to acquire a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-headquartered renewable energy company, ET had first reported on May 4. NIIF will draw up a shortlist of bidders over the next few weeks after which they will be allowed to conduct detailed due diligence on the company and submit binding offers, ET had reported. ONGC formed a new company in February to house its green energy investments. ONGC Green will invest in wind and solar power plants as well as green hydrogen and green ammonia. NTPC Green, which was carved out of listed NTPC two years ago, has announced plans for an initial public offering (IPO).Operational Capacity of 1.3 GWONGC and NTPC Green have a joint venture for developing offshore wind energy projects.  110186957ONGC and NTPC didn\u2019t respond to queries. NIIF owns a 51% stake in Ayana Renewable Power while British International Investment (formerly known as CDC Group) owns 32%. The Green Growth Equity fund of Eversource Capital owns 17%. Ayana\u2019s three co-investors led by NIIF have collectively pumped in $721 million as equity funding. It\u2019s estimated that the company\u2019s debt could be in the region of $1.2 billion, taking its enterprise value close to $2 billion. British International Investment, in its previous avatar as CDC, had floated Ayana Renewable in 2018 to further the UK\u2019s investments in green energy in India. NIIF became a controlling shareholder in December 2020. Ayana has a total pipeline of more than 4 GW of solar, wind and hybrid power projects across several states and has an operational capacity of 1.3 GW of renewable energy in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan. It has 2.8 GW of projects under development, with 2 GW of solar, wind and hybrid assets having firm power purchase agreements (PPAs). PPAs are yet to be signed for the remaining 800 MW of generation projects that it won through the bidding route. Of this, the group expects to commission a 300 MW wind power asset in the ongoing financial year and the rest through FY25 and FY26, subject to the timely signing of PPAs, according to an ICRA report. ONGC chairman Arun Kumar Singh announced last year that the company would set up 10 GW of renewable energy projects by 2030. It would also look at other areas such as green hydrogen and green ammonia to meet its target of turning a net-zero carbon emission company by 2038. Its investments toward decarbonisation could add up to about Rs 1 lakh crore.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The government is aiming to develop a skilled workforce of about 600,000 people over the next six years to power its ambitious nearly \u20b920,000 crore National Green Hydrogen Mission.This follows an analysis by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to identify the need for skilled workers across the entire value chain till 2030. The study will form the basis for preparing a plan in consultation with the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE), a senior government official told ET.Separately, the MNRE, the nodal ministry for the National Green Hydrogen Mission, has issued draft guidelines for skilling and hopes to finalise them by month-end after getting views of all stakeholders by May 16.110157054As per the guidelines, skilling under the mission will be imparted through short-term training, upskilling along with recognition of prior learning, creation of centres of excellence at identified institutions and curriculum based long duration training at schools, industrial training institutes (ITIs), polytechnics and higher educational institutions. The green hydrogen value chain comprises five distinct stages of renewable energy generation, hydrogen production, transformation, storage and transport, and end use applications.The government is of the view that development and utilisation of hydrogen technologies will require specific skill sets and hence the need for a coordinated skilling programme between multiple institutions.  A significant part of the skilling programme would be to reskill the workforce in sunset sectors to be absorbed into green hydrogen and its auxiliary ecosystem,  the official said. The government has earmarked \u20b935 crore for skilling, which will cover the entire lifecycle of short-term training (200-600 hours) and RPL based up-skilling (30-132 hours).",

The three-member team of Himdhara Environment Research and Action Collective reached the area last Saturday to document the testimonies of the affected people and ascertain the damage.  The team found that gushing muddy water from the leaking penstock of the hydro project affected around 80 families in the village and demanded a complete moratorium on new projects of 25 MW and above capacity.  The team also recommended a safety audit of all existing operational hydropower and mega projects in the state.  The project, constructed on the Lambadug river, is one among 40 projects in different stages of commissioning, construction, and planning on the Beas river and its tributaries.  Nineteen of these projects are of 25 MW and above capacity with significant underground and surface excavation.  The project, being executed by Megha Engineering Infrastructure Limited, had suffered leakage during the testing phase too. However, the volume of water was not large, and people were assured that the project would be operational only after all safety measures were taken.  The May 10 incident affected nearly a 300-metre stretch of Multhan market and about 4 hectares of farmland. The foundations and lower stories of the structures in the affected area are covered in 6 feet of muck, the team found.  They said water leakage continues despite the claim of project authorities that the reservoir had been completely drained. Water is leaking from near the pressure shaft and the penstock below the forebay.",

Around 15,000 delegates from around the world are attending the Summit.The India Pavilion at the conference provides India with an opportunity to showcase to the world the progress made by the country in the field of Green Hydrogen.The Indian delegation comprises nominees from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the Department of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and from private sector companies as well. In addition to various government-to-government interactions, the Summit provides a platform for Indian industry to engage with companies from around the globe.India launched its National Green Hydrogen Mission in January 2023 with an overall outlay of Rs 19,744 crores. India has set an ambitious target to achieve a green hydrogen production capacity of 5 million tonnes by the end of the year 2030.As on date, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has awarded tenders for setting up 412,000 tonnes of Green Hydrogen production capacity and 1,500 MW of electrolyzer manufacturing capacity.India meets a sizable portion of its energy needs through fossil fuels, and various renewable energy sources, including green hydrogen, are seen as an avenue to reduce the dependence on conventional sources of power.At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part  Panchamrit  pledge. They included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, to reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030.India as a whole also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070.About 44 per cent of India's energy requirements at present come from non-fossil sources and are likely to touch as high as 65 per cent by 2030, much higher than what the country pledged at the COP summit in 2021, Union Minister RK Singh, who handles power and renewable portfolio, said recently.

As projects mature and start generating cash, the allocation can decrease to as low as 1%. These changes could make it harder for construction projects to secure financing, impacting the pace of renewable energy deployment as India aims to accelerate green energy installations to meet future goals.

That compares with the current norm of just 0.4% provisioning for standard assets. The allocation can come down to as low as 1% as the project matures and starts generating cash for repayment of the loan.Also Read: RBI's latest norms may derail Modi govt's flagship economy driver\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to have a bearing,\u201d said Srishti Ahuja, a partner for infrastructure strategy and transactions at EY India. Besides raising the cost of funding, \u201cit will also make it more difficult for projects under construction to get financing,\u201d she told Bloomberg Television in an interview.If the proposals come into force, there could be a slowdown in the pace of deployment of renewables at a time when the nation is targeting to accelerate green energy installations to meet goals for 2030 and beyond. The proposed guidelines could also impact other projects, such as coal, road and hydropower, which generally have a longer gestation period.The requirement of keeping a greater amount of money to cover any defaults typically forces banks to raise lending rates to maintain profitability. \u201cIt is very premature\u201d to comment on the impact of the proposed guidelines, Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer of Tata Power Co. Ltd. told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a consultative paper. Let\u2019s wait and watch.\u201d",

The 250Kwh TESS, developed by E2S, has been synchronized with the IPCL system and will help the company achieve its goal of integrating 80 per cent renewable energy into the distribution system by the end of this year, a joint statement on Wednesday said.  This technology will be very critical to achieve India's net zero emission targets by not only allowing renewable energy to be stored efficiently but most importantly, enabling flexibility in thermal power operations to accommodate more power in the system without compromising the efficiency and health of thermal power plants, that are critical for the energy security of the country, it said.  The technology is a unique proposition for power sector players to integrate renewables and thermal energy seamlessly, it claimed.  IPCL's TESS business aims to extend its geographical reach across India, South East Asia, and ASEAN countries, promising widespread impact and potential, it added.  This initiative also seamlessly aligns with the Make in India initiative, with the majority of the TESS components being sourced locally against Lithium-ion Battery systems that are dependent on imports to the extent of 90 per cent of the components, IPCL director Somesh Dasgupta said.   With the deep penetration of renewable sources of electrical power such as solar and wind, flexibilisation of thermal power plants is essential. With the successful development and testing of our system, we can ramp up installation of these systems in Indian power plants that would enable much more flexible, reliable and ensure less intensive operations,  E2S Chief Technology Officer Sergei Pancheshnyi said.",

        "articleBody": "With renewable energy contributing more than 70% of the new power generated in India during FY24, green energy stocks have been unassailable and given up to 600% returns in the last one year. With a focus on achieving energy security and self-reliance (atma nirbharta), coupled with regulatory advancements, improved technology, and reduced costs, a substantial shift is underway across all aspects of energy\u2014from generation and transmission to distribution and consumption. This transition is expected to give rise to numerous new multibillion-dollar enterprises over the next decade,  says Sachin Shah, Fund Manager, Emkay Investment Managers.India's total installed energy capacity has now reached 442 GW, with renewables comprising about 33% and hydro contributing 11% as the share of coal in India's total installed capacity has fallen below the 50%-mark for the first time.The shift in the energy landscape is making investors chase green energy stocks. Shares of KP Energy have rallied around 599% in the last one year, KPI Green Energy 455% and WAA Solar 422%. Other top multibaggers include SJVN, BF Utilities, Orient Green Power Company and NHPC.   Why green energy?Green energy stocks are primarily those related to the renewables energy ecosystem like solar, wind, hydro, etc. The sector is in limelight as India has an ambitious target of reaching 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. The revised target is 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. In 2023, India spent $30 billion on green capital expenditure which Morgan Stanley expects to grow to more than $400 billion cumulatively in the decade 2022-32.Stating that power transmission is key to India\u2019s energy transition and global new energy cost leadership ambitions, Morgan Stanley analysts are betting on Power Grid. We view Power Grid as the largest beneficiary of our transition-linked grid capex estimate, which think the stock is not fully pricing in. Additionally, with Power Grid\u2019s large balance sheet, low cost of debt and strong annual FCF generation, we estimate it could fund 30% of India\u2019s grid capex by FY32E without reducing dividend payouts. We also think a cost of equity reduction led by beta compression could be another catalyst for stock re-rating,  Apoorva Bahadur of Morgan Stanley said.The global brokerage firm has a target price of Rs 355 on the stock.The recently-announced rooftop solar scheme under the Pradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana with an aim to install rooftop solar power systems for 1 crore households in India is also a big trigger for solar panel manufacturers. A typical rooftop solar panel requires solar panel (30-35% of total cost), followed by solar inverter (10-15%), Cables (8-12%), Metering and coordination with power distribution authorities and transportation/fabrications and other incidental labour charges. Thus, solar panel companies, including companies Waaree Energies/Renewables, Premier Energies, Insolation could see potential incremental revenue up to Rs 150 billion over next 3 years from rooftop solar segment for households,  JM Financial said.Investors see opportunity in the green energy sector for the next 10-15 years.  The kind of investment that is happening on the solar and wind side, companies like Suzon Energy and Inox Wind will benefit. In the smart metering space, we can have a manufacturer like Genus. Then on the HVDC side and transmission substation, ABB and Siemens will get benefit. Then, on the thermal side, Thermax and BHEL will be in focus,  said Rupesh D Sankhe of Elara Capital.(Data: Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "articleBody": "In India during FY 23-24, renewable energy (RE) contributed more than 70 per cent of the 26 GW (GigaWatt) of new power generated in the country.India's total installed energy capacity has now reached 442 GW, with RE comprising approximately 33 per cent (144 GW) and hydro contributing 11 per cent (47 GW), according to the report by CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF).The share of Coal in India's total installed capacity fell below the 50 per cent mark for the first time.The report further highlights that solar energy, including both grid-scale and rooftop installations, continued to dominate India's RE capacity addition, constituting approximately 81 per cent (15 GW) of the total RE addition in FY24.The wind capacity addition nearly doubled, reaching 3.3 GW compared to 2.3 GW in FY23. Additionally, nuclear capacity (1.4 GW) was added for the first time since FY17.In line with India's ambitious renewable energy targets, RE auctions soared to a record high, reaching approximately 41 GW of auctioned capacity in FY24.Furthermore, the report highlighted the conclusion of eight auctions with energy storage components, indicating a growing shift towards innovative power procurement formats. Around 95 per cent of India's targeted 50 GW annual RE bidding trajectory was met in FY24. Bids of 47.5 GW that were issued are approximately three times the RE capacity that has been added annually in recent years  said Gagan Sidhu, Director, CEEW-CEF.The report also noted a rise in peak power demand, reaching a new high of 240 GW in FY24. Factors contributing to this included a fast-growing economy and weather anomalies such as lower-than-expected rainfall and above-normal temperatures. In renewable energy, FY24 saw several policy moves to shift gears beyond utility-scale RE. For instance, PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana was introduced to increase rooftop solar installation in the residential segment, which could result in the addition of 30 GW  said Riddhi Mukherjee, Research Analyst, CEEW-CEF.The report also highlights that the amendments made by the Ministry of Power to the Electricity Rules of 2022, mandating the sale of un-requisitioned surplus power on exchanges, are expected to enhance supply-side liquidity and promote competitive prices on power exchanges.

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Energy storage systems are critical to increase the share of power generated through renewable energy sources, according to Icra. The share of renewable energy power generation, including large hydro, to India's total power production will increase to close to 40 per cent by FY2030 from less than 25 per cent currently, the rating agency said in a report. The increase will be driven by the large RE capacity addition process, it said.  Achieving such a high level of RE share would require development of energy storage systems (ESS) to manage the intermittency associated with wind and solar power. The ESS is currently mainly driven by the battery energy storage systems (BESS) and pumped hydro storage projects (PSP),  Icra said. The BESS also plays a role in improving grid stability, providing ancillary support services and peak load shifting, it said. Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said:  The discovered tariff under the BESS tenders more than halved from Rs 10.84 lakh/MW/month in the first Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) tender in August 2022 to Rs 4.49 lakh/MW/month in the latest tender by Gujarat in March 2024, reflecting the decline in battery prices and improving competitiveness of such projects. The viability of these projects remains pegged to the capital cost of the BESS. ",

        "articleBody": "India is poised to lead the transition towards a sustainable future with its abundance of renewable resources and a growing interest in e-mobility. Leveraging these resources, South India can play an important role in reducing carbon footprint, drive economic growth, and enhance energy security, renewable energy experts and industry players say. Collaborative efforts among policymakers, industry stakeholders, and civil society can accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions, paving the way for a cleaner and greener future. India's ambitious 'India Battery Manufacturing Vision' aims to achieve over 500 GWh capacity by 2035, attracting $35 billion in investments, they said.A report by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) highlighted that the southern states, namely Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, boast significant solar and wind energy potentials, collectively totaling 1,526 GW of solar energy potential and 1,124 GW of wind energy potential.However, achieving this potential requires substantial investments in strengthening the intra-region transmission infrastructure. The report suggests an investment of approximately Rs 9,245 crore by 2030, in addition to the ongoing transmission network strengthening initiatives by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). Despite several initiatives by the government, the low penetration of rooftop solar systems, especially in the domestic sector, remains a concern. Out of the total 72 gigawatts of solar energy capacity in India, only 11 gigawatts are from rooftop solar installations, with a mere 2.7 gigawatts attributed to the domestic sector. Installing 3-kilowatt rooftop solar systems in 25 crore households across India could add 6.3 gigawatts to the grid, a significant contribution to achieving 500 GW by 2030,  Bhagyathej Reddy, Director Power & Utilities, PwC said on the sidelines of RenewX 2024.Addressing the need for efficient evacuation of renewable energy (RE) generation from the southern region, the report emphasizes the necessity of significant upgrades in inter-regional transmission infrastructure. This, it asserts, is crucial to facilitate the transfer of excess power to other regions, ultimately establishing renewable energy as the mainstream electricity source in India.Andhra Pradesh and Telangana also exhibit appreciable capacities in both wind and solar energy. Highlighting the importance of renewable energy sector Ajay Mishra, Telangana State Advisor, Energy Committee, Federation of Telangana Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, \u201cThe renewable energy market in India, particularly in South India and Telangana, presents an interesting scenario with the simultaneous growth in both renewable energy and fossil fuels. Despite this situation, there has been significant growth in non-fossil fuel energy capacity. However, alongside this growth, there has also been a 15-gigawatt addition in the renewable energy sector, accompanied by an 11-12% increase in coal production,\u201d RenewX 2024 showcased South India\u2019s Renewable Energy innovations with a focus on sustainability and green energy. The two day expo witnessed around 5,000 visitors exploring the innovations presented by over 150 domestic and international companies. India boasts a vast pool of young and dynamic talent, and in recent years, the government has spearheaded numerous initiatives to position the country as an attractive manufacturing destination on the global stage. This includes the record addition of renewable energy capacity, with 18.48 GW added in 2023-24, which is over 21 per cent higher than the previous year. Looking forward, RenewX want to embark on the next level of growth path for South India\u2019s premier renewable energy show as we take it to Chennai, opening fresh opportunities for collaboration and innovation,\u201d Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India said.",

        "articleBody": "Adani Green Energy, which is looking to develop a 25 gigawatt portfolio by 2025, is in advanced talks with Rabobank, MUFG, SMBC and DBS for a $400 million loan, according to people familiar with the development. The loan is likely to be priced at a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points with a five-year tenor, they said.A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.The renewable energy arm of Adani Group will use the funds for capital expenditure, said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.In addition to this loan, Adani Green is planning to raise a $1.3 billion bond in the next two months, after the general elections. Last month, it became the first Adani Group company to raise funds through a dollar note sale after a year of the release of the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research's report alleging wrongdoings at the group, showing signs of investor confidence. The $409 million issue was oversubscribed seven times.Adani Green used $409 million raised through US dollar notes to refinance its five-year bullet of $500 million senior secured notes due in 2024. Adani Green had raised $409 million through an 18-year senior secured green bond, which garnered significant investor interest and was oversubscribed seven times. Now, the company is preparing to launch a larger bond issuance, capitalising on the strong investor demand,  said a third person close to the development.  The new fundraising will happen under 144 Reg S and could commence after the ongoing elections. Spokespersons of Adani Group, Rabobank, SMBC and MUFG did not respond to ET's queries regarding the development. DBS declined to comment. Adani Group's dollar bond has revived over the past one year.The group has 15 listed bonds for ports, renewable energy, distribution and transmission assets.Spreads between Adani bonds' yield to maturity (YTM) and comparable US G-Sec treasury bond yields have shrunk substantially for the overseas-listed Adani bonds in recent months and are the best since the beginning of January 2023. While the spread between government securities and Adani Group bonds was 150-382 bps, it has shrunk to 90-290 bps now. Until September 2023, the group had raised around \u20b980,000 crore from global investors across 15 companies, which is 34% of the total debt of \u20b92.26 lakh crore.For instance, Adani Green Energy's $750 million bond due in August 2024, which was issued at 4.375% in 2021, is now trading at a YTM of 7.86%. The spread between the 10-year US treasury and bond, which had risen to 326 bps, has now dropped to 241 bps. This is also because S&P Global, Fitch and Moody's have upgraded the outlook for Adani Ports & SEZ, Adani Electricity Mumbai (a subsidiary of Adani Energy Solutions) and Adani Green Energy.Adani Green Energy's operational portfolio consists of 7,393 MW solar, 1,401 MW wind and 2,140 MW wind-solar hybrid capacity. The company is developing a renewable energy project of 30,000 MW on 538 sq km of barren land at Khavda in Kutch, Gujarat. The company has operationalised 2,000 MW cumulative solar capacity within 12 months of commencing work. Adani Green Energy has locked-in projects of 21.8 GW and an operating renewable portfolio of about 10.9 GW, the largest in India, spread across 12 states.",

Industry executives said a notable feature of Varshney's tenure was his project to provide  living wages  to Statkraft's construction workers which included better healthcare, food and social security for their families in line with European standards, exceeding the local regulatory requirement of providing minimum wages which only cover the cost of living. It was remarkable especially since workers in this sector face high health and safety risks, they said.When contacted, Statkraft confirmed that Varshney was leaving the company. Varshney started his career at Aditya Birla Group as per his LinkedIn profile. During his tenure Statkraft attempted three acquisitions. It successfully bid under a bankruptcy process for Lanco Hydro Power's project near Kedarnath which was washed out by flash floods in 2013.",

        "articleBody": "Australia's Macquarie Asset Management has called off plans to sell renewable energy platform Vibrant Energy due to a valuation mismatch in negotiations, said people aware of the development. Vibrant, a portfolio company of Macquarie's Green Investment, is currently operating and delivering 1.9 GW of renewable energy solutions to corporate clients across India. It has an active pipeline of 3 GW. The company was in discussions with several players such as Bain Capital, Sun Energy and Vitol earlier and was looking for an enterprise value of $500 million. JP Morgan was advising Vibrant Energy in the sale process.However, Vibrant has decided to complete its existing projects and sell the business at a later stage. It develops open access renewable energy solutions (wind and solar) for corporate customers. A Macquarie spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. 109573132About 70% stake in Vibrant is owned by Blueleaf Energy, a portfolio company of Macquarie's Green Investment Group, while the rest is held by US-based ATN International. In 2020, Blueleaf Energy Asia entered India by acquiring a majority stake in Vibrant Energy Holdings from ATN International. Macquarie's GIG has a 90 gigawatt (GW) portfolio under development across 25 markets globally.Vibrant has power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Amazon for the production of about 500 MW of renewable energy capacity in India. It has also signed a long-term PPA with Saint-Gobain India to set up a 75 MW wind-solar hybrid project in Madhya Pradesh and Sify Technologies for a total 231 MW of solar and wind energy capacity.Vibrant had secured about \u20b92,200 crore of project financing from Power Finance Corporation for the construction of 300 MW of wind-solar hybrid projects in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Macquarie Group has been active in India for around 19 years and has invested about $2.5 billion in equity capital in infrastructure firms. The commercial and industrial sector (C&I), which accounts for half the energy demand of the country, is growing at a faster pace.India's rooftop solar market is bubbling with new energy, overcoming major roadblocks and expected to add a record 4 GW of capacity in 2023-24, said a report last year by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and JMK Research & Analytics.",

        "articleBody": "India's first multi-purpose green hydrogen pilot project at 1,500 MW Nathpa Jhakri Hydro Power Station (NJHPS) in Himachal's Jhakri was inaugurated on Wednesday, according to Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) officials. SJVN Chairman and Managing Director Geeta Kapur inaugurated a 20Nm3/hr electrolyzer and 25kW fuel cell capacity-based green hydrogen pilot project, a statement issued here said. The project is the nation's first multi-purpose (combined heat and power) green hydrogen generation plant with the capability to cater to the high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) coating facility of NJHPS to meet its combustion fuel requirements, in addition to generating electricity through its 25kW capacity fuel cell. It will produce hydrogen gas by splitting hydrogen and oxygen from water with the help of an alkaline electrolyzer of 20Nm3/hr capacity by utilising renewable energy supplied from the 1.31 MW solar power plant of SJVN located in Wadhal, Himachal Pradesh. The pilot project is set to produce 14 Kg of green hydrogen daily during eight hours of operation, which will be stored in 6 storage tanks. The green hydrogen will be utilised for HVOF coating of turbine underwater parts in addition to generating electricity through its 25kW capacity fuel cell, officials said.  Aligned with the National Green Hydrogen Mission of the Government of India, SJVN's Green Hydrogen Pilot Project is poised to accelerate the development of green hydrogen production infrastructure in the power sector, establishing green hydrogen as a clean energy source,  said Kapur. Kapur also inaugurated the first-of-kind centralised operation of 1,500 MW NJHPS and 412 MW Rampur Hydro Power Station (RHPS) by remotely operating Unit-2 of RHPS from the NJHPS control room at Jhakri.",

        "articleBody": "The government has allowed sugar mills to use 6.7 lakh tonnes of B-heavy molasses as feedstock for making ethanol in the current year, a senior Food Ministry official said on Wednesday. Sugar mills were holding excess stock of B-heavy molasses -- a byproduct of the sweetener -- produced before the ban on its use on December 7 last year. However, a week later, the government reversed the ban and allowed the use of cane juice and B-heavy molasses, but within the overall cap of a diversion of 17 lakh tonnes of sugar for ethanol production for the 2023-24 supply year (November-October).  We have permitted sugar mills to use B-heavy molasses lying with sugar mills for ethanol. The same has been communicated to the Petroleum Ministry,  the official told PTI. This will be over and above the capped diversion of 17 lakh tonne of sugar for ethanol production for 2023-24, he added. Currently, sugar mills have a B-heavy molasses stock of 6.7 lakh tonnes as per the state cane commissioners. The move comes following the industry's representations to the food ministry to allow B-heavy molasses for ethanol production and improve the finances of the sugar mills. The industry has stored B-heavy molasses for making ethanol after the crushing is over. But the government banned it suddenly and imposed a cap. Sugar production is estimated to be between 315-320 lakh tonnes in the ongoing 2023-24 season, excluding diversion of 17 lakh tonnes.",

        "articleBody": "Hitachi Energy is looking to open more global capability centers in India to expand local operations, amid growing energy demand and a push to scale up renewable energy generation in the country. Zurich-based Hitachi Energy, which makes transformers and large-scale power transmitters, operates a GCC in the country, where high power demand has led to the government ramping up generation, including in renewable energy.  We are looking at Hyderabad for our GCC.. and also looking at Pune. It might take six months to one year,  said Venu Nuguri, the managing director and CEO of the company's India unit. The center could be in either or both cities depending on the demand, he said, without giving financial details of the investment. The new GCC - a low-cost, offshore facility - will work alongside Hitachi Energy India, but will be part of a separate non-listed Indian entity of Hitachi Energy in Switzerland, Nuguri said. India's government last year rolled out incentives for green energy transition, with an aim to have 500 GW of installed capacity through non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. India's power consumption grew 8% in fiscal year 2023. The International Energy Agency estimates that India will add electricity demand roughly equivalent to the current consumption of the United Kingdom over the next three years.  To meet the projected demand, market needs to generate at least 3-4 times than what is being done. And accordingly, our order book will also grow two or three times, higher than market growth,  Nuguri said. The company had an order backlog of 72 billion rupees ($864.7 million) as of fiscal year 2023, according to Nuguri.",

This strategic alliance will facilitate comprehensive measures -- including training, capacity building, and policy advocacy -- directed towards catalysing the promotion and advancement of bio-based energy solutions with a special focus on green and blue hydrogen. The green hydrogen market in India is forecasted to achieve a total worth of USD 8 billion by 2030 and USD 340 billion by 2050, Kedia informed. With a shared objective of minimising the country's reliance on imported energy sources, the MoU marks commitment to joint efforts in propelling sustainable energy initiatives forward. The agreement is focussing on harnessing synergies from both associations, thereby catalysing the continued growth of the growing bio-based energy sector. While Indian Biogas Association remains dedicated to advancing the biogas industry, Hydrogen Association of India is committed to delivering comprehensive services and seeking optimal solutions for key stakeholders, spanning the entirety of the hydrogen sector's diverse industries. The partnership can also give an extra push to blue hydrogen, whose projections indicate that it is poised to increase to 80 million metric tons by 2050, contingent upon ongoing governmental endeavours worldwide to enforce more stringent regulations to foster the adoption of emission-free fuel sources, Kedia said.  The discourse surrounding the utilisation of hydrogen within the steel industry has garnered significant attention. However, it is crucial to note that carbon remains indispensable in the process.  By breaking methane molecules, inherent within biogas, we can simultaneously yield both carbon and hydrogen, thereby offering a viable solution to address this requirement,  he added. HAI president RK Malhotra stressed the importance of policy advocacy for the bio-hydrogen and biogas ecosystem. This collaborative approach aims to leverage government initiatives within the sector and empower the industry to achieve India's green energy goals, ultimately supporting the nation's sustainable growth, he stated.",

        "articleBody": "The green hydrogen (H2) electrolyzers market in India could swell to $78 billion by 2050 up from $4 billion in 2030, according to a new report from the High-level Policy Commission on Getting Asia to Net Zero convened by the Asia Society Policy Institute.As per the report, the net zero targets in Asia\u2019s four largest economies could substantially expand the market for green hydrogen (H2) electrolyzers, with the combined potential in these countries projected to reach $180 billion by 2050 for key industrial applications.Charith Konda, Energy Specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said, \u201cAnalysis of the three applications reveals that India's green hydrogen electrolyzer market is poised for significant growth, with a projected CAGR of 16%\u2014escalating from US$4 billion in 2030 to US$78 billion by 2050. This robust outlook sends a positive signal to investors and policymakers, underscoring the strategic role of green hydrogen in meeting net zero objectives.\u201dWhile China has an $85 billion market potential by 2050, up from $22 billion in 2030, in India, the market potential for green H2 electrolyzers is valued at $78 billion by 2050, up from $4 billion in 2030. Japan and South Korea could have $9 billion and $8 billion market by 2050, it added. Should the four countries adhere to their declared net zero targets, the analysis projects massive growth in the market potential of green H2 electrolyzers for the three industries by 2050,  the report added.The collective market potential for electrolyzers is expected to skyrocket to $180 billion by 2050, with a compound annual growth rate as high as 12% between 2030 and 2040. This is nearly five times as large as the market potential under a business-as-usual scenario, the report added. As per the report, the total electrolyzer market opportunity will be even greater since it includes applications for other industries. The study also breaks down the electrolyzer market potential for each of the three industries and four countries analyzed.Kate Logan, Associate Director of Climate at the Asia Society Policy Institute, noted, \u201cThese findings underscore how ambitious net zero targets can shape demand for a new and critical technology, such as electrolyzers, that will be essential to decarbonizing the region and the world. Asia\u2019s industrial giants could therefore see net zero pathways as vehicles for driving development, rather than limiting it.\u201dCommenting on the report, Amitabh Kant, India\u2019s G20 Sherpa, said, \u201cI congratulate the Asia Society Policy Institute for releasing the Green Hydrogen for Decarbonizing Asia\u2019s Industrial Giants report, which showcases the need to transform the hard-to-abate sectors of the economy, including steel and fertilizers. As India has set its sights on becoming energy-independent by 2047 and achieving Net Zero by 2070, we recognize the critical role of Green Hydrogen. India, with its vast renewable energy resources, also has the opportunity to produce Green Hydrogen for the world.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "In a remarkable transformation, a desolate airstrip nestled in the remote expanse bordering Pakistan is set to become the launchpad for one of the world's largest renewable energy parks. This airstrip, devoid of an air traffic controller and equipped only with basic amenities like a portable toilet and a makeshift office, seemed an improbable starting point for such a venture. However, it now serves as the gateway to the sprawling Khavda renewable energy park, a testament to innovation and vision in India's renewable energy sector.Back in December 2022, Gautam Adani, the head of the Adani group and then the world's second richest person, made his inaugural landing at this diminutive airstrip. Located amidst miles of arid terrain, lacking even a pincode, the area derived its name from a village situated 80 km away. It was a landscape bereft of vegetation, characterized by highly saline soil and minimal human habitation. Yet, beneath its desolate facade lay the promise of abundant renewable energy resources.An 18-kilometer journey from the airstrip, through dusty arid plains, leads to the site of the Khavda renewable energy park, sprawling over 538 square km- approximately five times the size of Paris. Despite the initial skepticism, Adani's vision saw potential in the region, boasting the second-best solar radiation in the country after Ladakh and wind speeds five times that of the plains.At the inception of the project, Adani humorously questioned whether even a mosquito could survive in such a barren landscape, a sentiment echoed by his executives. However, subsequent efforts have seen the installation of solar panels to harness sunlight and wind turbines to capitalize on the brisk winds, along with the establishment of worker colonies and essential amenities like desalination plants and mobile phone repair shops.Vneet Jaain, Managing Director of Adani Green Energy, outlined the company's ambitious plans for the Khavda park, with an investment of approximately Rs 1.5 lakh crore aimed at generating 30 megawatts of clean electricity. The recent commissioning of 2,000 MW capacity marks a significant milestone, with plans underway to add an additional 4 GW in the current fiscal year and 5 GW annually thereafter.Despite the remote location, the airstrip plays a crucial role in ferrying group executives from Mundra or Ahmedabad several times a week. Pilots navigating towards Khavda rely on visual aids and aircraft navigation systems, with communication limited to phone updates with the Bhuj air traffic controller, located 160 km away.Situated just one kilometer from the international border with Pakistan, the energy park maintains a buffer zone manned by the Border Security Force (BSF). The construction of the airstrip itself, completed in a mere 35 days, underscores the challenges overcome in an environment where even tractors required modification to navigate the unforgiving terrain.Despite these hurdles, Adani Green Energy plans to generate 500 GW of electricity from non-fossil sources by 2030. The Khavda park, at its peak, is projected to generate 81 billion units of electricity, a quantity capable of powering entire nations.Jaain emphasized the composition of the planned 30 GW capacity at Khavda, comprising 26 GW of solar and 4 GW of wind power. The project's comprehensive development efforts have included extensive infrastructure construction, environmental assessments, and feasibility studies over the past five years, with a focus on sustainability and innovation.As construction progresses, Khavda's transformation from barren land to a renewable energy powerhouse stands as a testament to human ingenuity and determination in tackling the pressing challenges of climate change and energy transition.(Inputs from PTI) 109220077 109107172",

        "articleBody": "A narrow airstrip that doesn't even have an air traffic controller to guide incoming airplanes and whose only infrastructure is a portable toilet and a make-shift office in a container in the midst of miles of barren land bordering Pakistan is an unlikely gateway to the world's largest renewable energy park. The airstrip was even smaller in December 2022, when Adani group head Gautam Adani, who was then the second richest person in the world, first used a small aircraft to reach the barren area that didn't even have a pincode and got its name from a village 80-kilometers away.  The land hardly had any vegetation due to its highly saline soil, leave alone any habitation. But the area with second best solar radiation in the country after Ladakh and wind speeds five times of plains, served as an idle location for a renewable energy park.  An 18-km drive from the airstrip through dusty arid land is the site for his group's Khavda renewable energy park spread over 538 square kilometers (roughly five times the size of Paris).  When Adani first landed at Khavda, he joked if anyone could even find a mosquito in the area, his executives said.  But since then, his group has not just laid solar panels that will convert sun rays into electricity and wind mills to harness wind blowing at the speed of 8 meters per second, but also built colonies for workers, put up desalination plants to make saline water pumped out of 700 meters below ground portable and utilities such as mobile phone repair shops.  Adani Green Energy Ltd, India's largest renewable energy company, will invest about Rs 1.5 lakh crore to generate 30 megawatts of clean electricity at Khavda in Gujarat's Kutch, it's Managing Director Vneet Jaain said.   We have just now commissioned 2,000 MW (2 GW) of capacity at Khavda and plan to add 4 GW in the current fiscal (financial year ending March 2025) and 5 GW every year thereafter,  he said.  The airstrip is used to ferry group executives from Mundra or Ahmedabad a few times a week.  Air traffic controller or ATC at Bhuj, some 160-km away, is the last guide post for airplanes going to Khavda. But it's reach is only till 'Tent City' and pilots are virtually on their own for the last leg of 80-km or so including landing.   We use visual aids and airplanes' navigation systems to land. When taking off, we convey to Bhuj about the plans over phone,  a pilot flying the Adani Group-owned plane said.  The outer flange of the energy park is just one km from the international border with Pakistan. The one-km buffer is manned by BSF.  Executives said the airstrip was built in just 35 days in an area where even tractors had to be modified so they could operate in land that doesn't easily absorb water.  The area has its own set of challenges - heavy dust storms during March to June, no communication and transport infrastructure, nearest habitable area being 80-km away, water not seeping under soil during rainy season, even ground water being saline and it being a restricted zone.  Executives said while some workers from Khavda village, accommodation are being built to house 8,000 workers.  Adani group's renewable energy plans are the most ambitious by any corporate in the country which is targeting to generate 500 GW of electricity from non-fossil sources by 2030, as part of a broader plan of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.  Khavda at its peak will generate 81 billion units that can power entire nations such as Belgium, Chile and Switzerland, they said.  Jaain said the 30 GW planned at Khavda would comprise 26 GW of solar and 4 GW of wind capacity.  AGEL's existing operational portfolio comprises 7,393 MW solar, 1,401 MW wind and 2,140 MW wind-solar hybrid capacity.  While Khavda region witnesses 2,060 kWh/m2 of high solar irradiation and one of the best wind resources in India, with speeds of 8 meters per second, frequent sandstorms necessitate cleaning of solar panels several times in a day.  Project will be entirely covered with waterless robotic module cleaning systems, executives said. Khavda land belongs to the government, which leased out the site to Adani group for 40 years.  Executives said over the last five years, Adani Green conducted geotechnical investigations, seismic studies, a centrifuge study by Cambridge, resource assessment and land studies, Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD), and a detailed feasibility study, amongst several others, before embarking on the development of this site.  Construction started in 2022. The comprehensive infrastructure development effort included the construction of 100 km roads, 50 km of drainage, establishment of desalination and 3 reverse osmosis (RO) plants with a total capacity of 70 cubic meter per hour to meet the drinking water requirements of the project staff, laying optical fiber cables for 180 km for connectivity, and concrete batching plants.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Larsen and Toubro (L&T) as well as energy companies Greenko Group and Welspun New Energy will be setting up green hydrogen and green ammonia units at Gujarat\u2019s Deendayal Port Authority (DPA) in Kandla, said people with knowledge of the matter. The project could see a cumulative investment of up to Rs 1 lakh crore, according to three industry executives aware of the development. This will be among the largest such investments in the sector and the energy infrastructure space in India.The port authority had received expressions of interest for 14 land parcels of 300 acres each in October last year. Each parcel was earmarked for 1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia. Last month, DPA allotted the plots to the four companies, said the people cited above.\u201cDPA offered 14 plots with around 4,000 acres of land in total. Of this, RIL has been allotted six plots, L&T has been allotted five, Greenko Group has bagged two and Welspun New Energy has been allotted one plot. These four companies had bid the highest in the auction,\u201d said one of them.The information hasn\u2019t been made public because the Model Code of Conduct is in place ahead of the general elections. A formal announcement will be made in June after the polls, said the people cited above.Kandla port is targeting green ammonia production of 7 MTPA and 1.4 MTPA of green hydrogen. Located in the Gulf of Kutch, DPA is one of the major ports on the country\u2019s western coast. Green hydrogen (GH2) is made by electrolysing water using power from renewable energy sources, without the emission of any greenhouse gases. This is part of a global effort to make green hydrogen the fuel that can help countries attain their net-zero emission targets, since water is the only byproduct. Ammonia is the largest end-user segment for green hydrogen and plays a pivotal role in producing GH2 at scale.109173721As part of the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the ministry of ports, shipping & waterways (MoPSW) had identified and nominated DPA, Paradip Port in Odisha and VO Chidambaranar Port in Tamil Nadu for development as hydrogen hubs, capable of handling, storage and generation of green hydrogen by 2030. DPA had last year signed 13 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with energy companies including ReNew EFuels, Statkraft India, Welspun New Energy, Sembcorp Green Hydrogen India, Torrent Power Ltd, NTPC Green Energy and Greenko Group among others.RIL, Greenko, Welspun and DPA didn\u2019t respond to queries. L&T declined comment.The ports and shipping ministry has also drawn up a National Action Plan for Green Shipping. This involves the increased use of renewable energy (solar, wind) and clean fuels (electric, liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas) to reduce vehicle emissions at ports. It also aims to introduce ammonia and hydrogen as a fuel for future use at ports.India's National Green Hydrogen Mission envisages making the country a global hub for green hydrogen production, utilisation and export to reduce its trillion-dollar energy imports and helping to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors. The mission targets a green hydrogen production capacity of 5 MTPA by 2030 with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW at an investment of over Rs 8 lakh crore and a cumulative reduction in fossil fuel imports by over Rs 1 lakh crore. It will also help abate nearly 50 MT of annual greenhouse gas emissions.",

Earlier in December, Adani Green raised a $1.4 billion loan from a group of banks.India\u2019s focus on infrastructure, which is likely to continue if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is re-elected in elections due by May, may increase bond supply from the sector, Sharon Chen, a credit analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note last month.India is planning to nearly triple its clean energy capacity by the end of the decade, mostly through solar and wind projects, to decarbonize its fossil fuel-driven economy. The nation aims to invest $30 billion to build transmission lines to connect green power to the grid. ",

Hydrogenious' LOHC technology enables the safe and cost-effective storage and transportation of hydrogen using existing liquid fuel infrastructure, according to a statement. Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) can be used for long-term storage and long-distance transport of hydrogen.  ACME Group and Hydrogenious LOHC Technologies have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on a feasibility study to explore the joint development of large-scale hydrogen supply chains from ACME's projects in Oman to supply hubs in Europe using the innovative LOHC technology.  Both parties intend to extend the partnership to evaluate the hydrogen value chain from the US to Europe.  Oman benefits from abundant renewable energy resources such as solar and onshore wind while the US Inflation Reduction Act offers production incentives leading to competitive hydrogen production cost.  The green hydrogen produced by ACME in these projects can be stored in LOHC and transported by tanker to Europe to supply and decarbonise industrial offtakers, energy and mobility.   ...we have taken conclusive decisions on our Oman project and partnering with Hydrogenious to develop efficient logistics using LOHC is the next step in delivering cost-effective value proposition for our customers,  Ashwani Dudeja, Group President and Director for ACME Group, said in the statement.   Our collaboration will contribute to making clean hydrogen from the MENA region and the US available to European off-takers in the mid- to long-term,  Toralf Pohl, Chief Commercial Officer at Hydrogenious LOHC Technologies said in the statement..  Gurugram-based ACME Group is a sustainable solutions provider.",

        "articleBody": "Adani Green Energy Limited is developing 30 GW renewable energy plant on barren land at Khavda in Kutch of Gujarat over area of 538 sq km after which it would become the planet's largest power plant regardless of the energy source.The area of project in Khavda is five times the size of Paris and almost as large as Mumbai. The project was started in December 2022 and the first production was made on December 31, 2023. Adani Green Energy Limited will invest about Rs 1.5 lakh crore and Adani group will invest about Rs 2.3 lakh crore in renewable energy and manufacturing capacity by 2030.The project at Khavda is Hybrid renewable energy cluster where during the morning hours, solar energy is generated and during the evening hours wind generation is generated. It has operationalised capacity of 2,000 MW solar energy.When asked about the timeline that company will follow to reach its aim, Vneet Jaain, MD, Adani Green Energy Limited and Director, Adani New Industries Limited, said,  Currently at the Khavda project site, 2 GW power production is completed and the company aims to produce 4 GW more in the ongoing financial year, 2024-25, making it 6 GW by March '25. After this the company plans to expand by minimum of 5GW every year .At the Khavda project site there are 30 wind turbines installed as of now and foundation for 50 wind turbines had been already laid and 40 lakh solar panels have been installed. The company aims to install 7 cr 50 lakh solar panels till 2029 and aims to produce 45,000 MW by 2030.As India is developing and renewable energy sources are making their place with government's emphasis also on things like green hydrogen, Vneet Jaain added that the support from central and state government is extraordinary for the project. In next three to four years, India can become self-reliant in terms of renewable energy sources, he added.AGEL project site in Khavda uses waterless cleaning robots for the entire solar capacity to address dust accumulation on panels to increase energy output and help conserve water in the arid Kutch region.With this project India is poised to avoid about 58 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. This renewable energy project is spread across 12 states in which major production takes place in Rajasthan and Gujarat. With time we will expand to other states but have no plan as of now, said Vneet Jaain.",

        "articleBody": "Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Adani Group will invest about Rs 2.3 lakh crore through 2030 in India's most ambitious renewable energy expansion and solar and wind manufacturing capacity addition ever as it shrugs off a short-seller attack to pursue its trademark rapid growth plans. Adani Green Energy Ltd, India's largest renewable energy company, will invest about Rs 1.5 lakh crore in expanding capacity to generate electricity from solar energy and wind power at Khavda in Gujarat's Kutch to 30 gigawatts from 2 GW currently and another Rs 50,000 crore in 6-7 GW of similar projects elsewhere in the country, a top company official said. Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), a unit in the group's flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd, will invest close to Rs 30,000 crore in expanding solar cell and wind turbine manufacturing capacity at Mundra in Gujarat. AGEL, which currently has an operating portfolio of 10,934 megawatts (10.93 GW), is targeting 45 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. 30 GW of this will come up at just one location at Khavda - the world's largest renewable energy project.  We have just now commissioned 2,000 MW (2 GW) of capacity at Khavda and plan to add 4 GW in the current fiscal (financial year ending March 2025) and 5 GW every year thereafter,  said Vneet S Jaain, Managing Director, AGEL.  To support these plans as well as meet requirements of other domestic renewable players and export market, ANIL plans to expand its cell and module manufacturing facility at Mundra to 10 GW by 2026-27 from current 4 GW, Jaain, who is also a director on the board of ANIL, said. Crystalline silicon is turned into cells capable of converting sun rays into electric current and mounted on modules before being placed in high radiation areas such as Khavda. Electricity thus generated is wired to the transmission grid for onward movement to customers.  Besides solar manufacturing, ANIL is also doubling capacity to make windmills that generate electricity from wind, to 5 GW in three-and-a-half years, he said. Adani Group which spans from seaports to electricity generation and transmission, natural gas distribution, mining, copper production, airports, data centre and commodities business, has a capital expenditure outlay of Rs 1.2 lakh crore for 2024-25 fiscal (April 2024 to March 2025). The group's renewable energy plans are the most ambitious by any corporate in the country which is targeting to generate 500 GW of electricity from non-fossil sources by 2030 as part of a broader plan of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. Khavda, spread over 538 square kilometres which is the equivalent of five times the area that the city of Paris does, will at peak generate 81 billion units that can power entire nations such as Belgium, Chile and Switzerland. AGEL's other project sites are in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. The massive clean power generation park is located in barren land close to the border with Pakistan. Jaain said the 30 GW planned at Khavda would comprise 26 GW of solar and 4 GW of wind capacity. AGEL's existing operational portfolio comprises 7,393 MW solar, 1,401 MW wind and 2,140 MW wind-solar hybrid capacity.  Its current portfolio of 10,934 MW, which will power more than 5.8 million homes and avoid about 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, represents around 11 per cent of India's installed utility-scale solar and wind capacity, contributing over 15 per cent of the nation's utility-scale solar installations.  The renewable energy push comes as the apples-to-airport conglomerate shrugs off the impact of Hindenburg Research that in January last year published allegations that Adani companies had engaged in share price manipulation and accounting fraud.  The group has refuted all allegations, which caused the combined market capitalisation of its listed companies to fall by USD 150 billion at their worst point. Its chairman Gautam Adani has in recent months stated that the group's balance sheet was  healthier than ever before . In the immediate aftermath of the short-seller report, Adani has reassured investors and bondholders by slowing some investment plans, paying down share-backed debt and selling stakes to outside backers, including Florida-based investment firm GQG Partners. But now it is back to its breakneck speed expansion, switching back-to-back deals including one with Reliance Industries Ltd of rival billionaire Mukesh Ambani.",

        "articleBody": "With an aggregate capacity of 15 GW currently under construction, the nation is poised to witness a substantial increase in its hydroelectric power potential, targeting a rise from the present 42 GW to an impressive 67 GW by 2031-32, marking an increase of over 50 percent.India is on the cusp of a significant transformation in its energy sector, with the Ministry of Power announcing the progress of hydroelectric power projects, set to substantially augment the country's renewable energy capacity.According to a press release by the Ministry of Power, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a favorable monsoon in the fiscal year 2024-25, which is expected to contribute significantly to the improvement in water reservoir levels.Particularly crucial is the contribution from snowmelt in the Himalayan region, which acts as a vital resource for hydropower projects.Consequently, any rise in temperature leading to increased snowmelt will further bolster the capacity of these projects, read the press release.Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs), often referred to as 'the Water Battery', are also gaining prominence in the country's energy transition.These projects, aimed at providing greater inertia and balancing power to the grid, are currently under construction with an aggregate capacity of 2.7 GW, while an additional 50 GW is in various stages of development.It is anticipated that PSP capacity will surge from 4.7 GW to approximately 55 GW by 2031-32.However, the recent decline in hydro power generation during 2023-24 has raised concerns. While lower rainfall in the southern region contributed to reduced energy generation, the situation was exacerbated by natural disasters impacting key power stations in the northern and eastern regions, read the press release.Flash floods in Himachal Pradesh and the Eastern region disrupted operations, leading to a notable decrease in hydro power generation.Addressing concerns about the fluctuating hydrology of river basins, experts emphasized the variability of rainfall patterns and cautioned against assuming future trends based solely on past data.Despite these challenges, the government remains optimistic about the replenishment of reservoir capacities, especially with the IMD's prediction of a promising monsoon in FY 2024-25.This anticipated increase in rainfall could potentially reverse the trend of declining reservoir levels experienced in the previous year.Highlighting the pivotal role of hydroelectric power in India's energy landscape, officials stressed its significance in providing essential peaking support to the electricity grid, thereby enhancing the reliability and resilience of the power system, read the press release.The development of hydro power projects has faced hurdles in recent years, ranging from natural calamities to contractual disputes.However, aligning with India's commitments under the COP Paris agreement, the government has adopted a proactive approach towards hydro power development to accelerate progress.India's renewable energy capacity has witnessed remarkable growth, surpassing targets set at the COP 21 Paris Summit.The nation's commitment to reducing emissions intensity and increasing the share of non-fossil fuel-based energy resources underscores its dedication to combating climate change.

        "articleBody": "Green hydrogen (GH2) and green ammonia segments are estimated to drive investments of $125 billion (about \u20b910.43 lakh crore) in India by 2030, according to a report by investment banking firm Avendus Capital.The report, titled 'Green Hydrogen, The Next Frontier In Energy Transition', said the growth would be driven by an increasing focus on sustainability, demonstrated commercial viability, ever-expanding use cases and a strong regulatory push.GH2 is made by electrolysis of water, using power from renewable energy sources. It does not emit any greenhouse gases. Efforts are on globally to make green hydrogen the fuel that can help countries attain their net-zero emission targets. India is home to one of the cheapest renewable electricity costs globally, has abundant availability of fresh water and is emerging as a global manufacturing hub - three essential elements required for the production of green hydrogen at a competitive cost,  said Prateek Jhawar, managing director, Avendus Capital.He said there is an emergence of the first set of serious standalone and integrated participants forging partnerships to aggregate capabilities and infrastructure to tap into GH2 derivatives. While the commercial and industrial business model for domestic consumption of green hydrogen will drive the first set of investments in the sector, the steel industry will form the largest share of off-take contracts in the near term with the imposition of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in the EU,  Jhawar said.GH2 is being touted as the fuel of the future, with massive research and development investments in establishing the commercial viability of hydrogen in transport, power, aviation, shipping and other industrial uses. Significant push is also substantiated by the clean attributes of hydrogen and its high energy content.The report said green hydrogen is becoming increasingly competitive with the current production forms of hydrogen as production costs have plummeted more than 40% in the past eight years and is expected to reduce further and reach parity with blue hydrogen in the near future. Blue hydrogen is produced mainly from natural gas.",

        "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL), Tata Motors and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will be the key bidders for the government's pilot project for the use of green/grey hydrogen (H2) in the transport sector, according to people who are aware of the development. The initiative is in line with the government's aim to decarbonise the economy, reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, and enable India to assume technology and market leadership in green hydrogen. The pilot projects will help to identify operational issues (with regards to H2) and gaps in terms of current technology readiness, regulations, implementation methodologies, infrastructure, and supply chains,  stated the revised request for proposal (RFP) document reviewed by ET.The bid for the Rs 496-crore project which opened in February, closes on Thursday. It is part of the National Green Hydrogen Mission which was launched in January 2023 with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore. One of the key criteria from the bidders is participation as a consortium or partners to ensure the entire value chain - from making hydrogen and dispensing it and running vehicles fuelled by hydrogen. The bidding consortium should include a vehicle manufacturer, hydrogen fuel supplier distributor, and other partners as required.According to industry sources, while Reliance is partnering with bus and truck maker Ashok Leyland and Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV), Tata Motors is joining hands with IOCL as a consortium. Ashok Leyland is also partnering with NTPC for the same. Queries sent to RIL, NTPC and IOCL remained unanswered till press time.To be sure, most of the automakers have been running pilots on hydrogen-fuelled trucks and buses for energy companies such as RIL and NTPC for some time now. Spokespersons at Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland were not immediately available for a comment. A DICV spokesperson confirmed that it has given  letter of support  to RIL for the project.Among the bidders for the tender, RIL-which is also a participant in the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the electrolyzer and green H2, is the only one that can be an end-to-end service provider for the pilot project-from H2 manufacturing and dispensing the fuel to running an H2-powered vehicle.The oil-to-telecom conglomerate which has been building the new energy business for the past few years, will be a big beneficiary if it wins the bid for the project. It would pave the way for the mass scale hydrogen production in the coming years in line with the government's intent, said a person familiar with the project.The H2 corridor project seeks to support the deployment of hydrogen-powered buses, trucks, and cars, in a phased manner on a pilot basis. The winners of technical followed by the commercial bid, will be provided funds to close the viability gap due to the relatively higher capital cost of hydrogen-powered vehicles in the initial years. The learnings from the pilot projects will help inter-city bus and truck operators (including State Transport Undertakings), and private car users in gaining experience with the deployment and usage of hydrogen-powered vehicles and refueling technologies, according to the RFP.Industry sources added that piloting the project with grey hydrogen will allow companies time to set up the infrastructure and ensure smooth functioning of the same. Grey hydrogen is produced by natural gas or coal.",

The 10-megawatt proton exchange membrane electrolyser for the green-hydrogen producing unit at the Vijaipur complex in Madhya Pradesh state has been imported from Canada, they added.   Once the initial hiccups are sorted at the commissioning stage, we expect to start producing in a month's time,  one of the sources said. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The unit is expected to produce about 4.3 metric tons of hydrogen per day, with a purity of about 99.999% by volume, and would use renewable power. India aims to reach 5 million tons of annual green hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The company's communication office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.",

As per the pact, BPCL- a central PSU, will set up CBG plants in Raipur and Bhilai with an investment of around Rs 100 crore and the capacity of each plant will be 100-150 tonne per day.  The MoU was signed in the presence of Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai and Deputy CM Arun Sao here at the former's official residence, they said.  In his address, Chief Minister Sai said the establishment of CBG plants is a key step towards clean city, clean energy and zero carbon emissions.  About 200-250 metric tonne of municipal solid waste will be used every day in the production of biofuel in the two CBG plants. BPCL will invest approximately Rs 100 crore for setting up the two plants, Sai said.  The setting up of these plants will create about 60,000 man days of employment directly and indirectly every year.  On production and sale at full capacity in these plants, the state will receive GST to the tune of Rs 45 lakh per year, he said.  These plants will also yield organic fertilizer as a by-product which will help in organic farming in the state, he added.  The MoU was signed by Chief Executive Officer of Chhattisgarh Biofuel Development Authority Sumit Sarkar, Chief General Manager of BPCL, Mumbai Anurag Saravagi, Commissioner of Raipur Municipal Corporation Avinash Mishra and Commissioner of Bhilai Municipal Corporation Devesh Kumar Dhruv, officials said.",

        "articleBody": "The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday approved a green hydrogen policy, and a proposal for setting up two units of 800 MW in Anpara in collaboration with NTPC at a cost of Rs 8,624 crore. The decisions were taken at a Cabinet meeting presided by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.   So far, hydrogen production technology has relied on electricity or gas, known as gray hydrogen. A significant effort is now underway to transition from gray hydrogen to green hydrogen. The policy outlines an ambitious goal to produce one million metric tonne of green hydrogen annually within the next 4 years, by 2028,  an official release quoted Energy Minister AK Sharma as saying.  The green hydrogen policy has been set for 5 years. Industries establishing themselves within this timeframe will receive subsidies and other incentives totalling Rs 5,045 crore.   These industries will be eligible for subsidies ranging from 10 to 30 per cent on capital expenditure, with the first five industries enjoying discounts of up to 40 per cent. Additionally, the policy includes provisions for energy banking, offering a 100 per cent rebate on intrastate electricity charges and billing and transmission charges for interstate transactions,  Sharma said.  Moreover, there is a provision for a 100 per cent exemption in electricity duty, he added.  The Cabinet also approved a proposal for setting up two units of 800 MW at Anpara in Sonbhadra district in collaboration with NTPC at a cost of Rs 8,624 crore.  This initiative will advance through a 50-50 partnership between the state government and NTPC.  The financial structure involves 30 per cent equity shared between the state government and NTPC, while the remaining 70 per cent will be financed through loans. The coal mine will be acquired from NCL (Northern Coalfields Ltd), which is located nearby, paving way for production of cost-effective electricity, Sharma said.  Two MoUs were signed with NTPC in 2023 Global Investors Summit. Of these, the first proposal to set up two 800 MW units in Obra D was approved by the Cabinet last year itself, while the second proposal to establish two 800 MW plants got the nod from the Cabinet on Tuesday.",

A period that probably the globe has not seen in the last 100 years as we come out of this very difficult period of the pandemic as we reinvigorate ourselves by furthering trade, commerce or economies, through that employment, better lives for people across the world, and return to normalcy or greater heights. Drawing inspiration from Prime Minister Modi's vision for India, Minister Scindia emphasized the importance of seizing opportunities in critical sectors such as the national green hydrogen mission, semiconductors, drones, and others.He stressed the need for proactive leadership in harnessing these opportunities to propel India towards becoming a global leader in innovation and technology. As PM Modi said to us that- whether it is the area of national green hydrogen mission, whether it is the area of semiconductors We just started about two new plants being set up for wafers in India, where there's the area of drones, So we must catch opportunities early as responsible leaders of the world harvest those opportunities and become world leaders in those areas,  said Minister Scindia.Minister Scindia further emphasized the pivotal role of the steel sector in India's journey towards becoming a dominant global economic power.He highlighted India's current status as the fifth-largest economy and projected its ascent to surpass Germany and Japan within the next three to four years, solidifying its position as the third-largest economy globally.He said,  And I do believe that the steel sector has a very pivotal fundamental role to play in India's emergence as a world power. We are today the fifth largest economy in the next three to four years. We will be ahead of Germany and Japan. To become the third largest economy. The inauguration of India's first green hydrogen plant within the stainless steel sector represents a significant leap forward in India's quest for sustainable development and economic growth. ",

        "articleBody": "Think of an iconic image of the petroleum age, and you may well be picturing a fountain of crude spouting hundreds of feet into the air, scattering thousands of barrels around a smashed drilling derrick.From Spindletop \u2014 the Texan oilfield whose 1901 blowout kickstarted the oil era and sparked nearby Houston\u2019s transformation into one of America\u2019s biggest cities \u2014 to the disaster 109 years later when a gusher on the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig, such geysers have been synonymous with both the wealth and the damage that hydrocarbons can bestow. Those who hope to remake the energy industry for a zero-emissions world are still looking for their equivalent. Right now, the absence of a gas gusher is the main factor holding back geological hydrogen, a promising fuel that few had given any thought to 12 months ago. For decades, chemists and engineers have argued the simplest molecule, with the formula H2, might supplant the role of oil and gas in providing the heat, energy, and chemical feedstocks on which modern society depends. Only recently have geologists realized the earth\u2019s crust might hold vast quantities of the stuff. It was long assumed that hydrogen\u2019s reactivity would make it vanishingly rare in nature. That view looks much less solid now. Natural processes are probably producing 23 million metric tons a year, according to one paradigm-breaking 2020 study. Unpublished research by the US Geological Survey suggests that\u2019s a gross underestimate: There might be 5 trillion tons below the surface, capable of producing 500 million tons a year, the Financial Times reported last month. That could be sufficient to displace about 40% of current natural gas consumption. The discoveries might spark a \u201cclean energy gold rush,\u201d New Scientist magazine announced in a recent cover story.As with previous gold rushes, the experts in the field are veterans of former booms. Avon McIntyre and Benjamin Mee worked for Shell Plc\u2019s gas business before setting up HyTerra Ltd., focusing on a region of Kansas where an oil driller had found hydrogen was making it harder to set the cement needed to seal up well holes. Their leases appear to contain about 238,000 tons of hydrogen and 470 million cubic feet of helium, according to a prospective resource assessment issued to the Australian Securities Exchange in December.It\u2019s not simply a matter of transferring expertise, however. Petroleum geologists study the sorts of sedimentary rocks that trap oil and gas, but hydrogen appears to be produced when water interacts with iron-rich volcanic minerals, a quite different type of rock, says Mengli Zhang, a former PetroChina Co. geologist now working at the Colorado School of Mines. Finding promising resources is going to necessitate bringing in expertise from the mining industry and even the geothermal power sector, she said.\u201cThere is the potential for such discoveries, but we don\u2019t know how likely it will be,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far, there are no world-class discoveries.\u201dWhat\u2019s missing is a Spindletop. It\u2019s precisely the explosive potential of oil and gas reservoirs that makes them economically attractive, according to Arnout Everts, an independent energy consultant based in Kuala Lumpur. Gathering over millions of years in folded, impermeable rock formations deep below the earth, hydrocarbon deposits build up vast pressures that force their riches to the surface the moment a drill bit pierces the rock capping them.Gushers are what guarantee the vast flow rates needed to supply our fuel demands. A study last month in the journal Science described a discovery of an Albanian mine exhaling about 200 tons of hydrogen a year as \u201cone of the largest recorded H2 flow rates to date.\u201d But that would barely move the needle for a typical green ammonia plant, which would consume tens or even hundreds of thousands of tons of hydrogen a year. Hyterra and Gold Hydrogen Ltd., another company which last month reported a helium resource on a hydrogen exploration tenement near Adelaide, are yet to produce flow-rate data. \u201cWe have to generate that information with a drill bit,\u201d says HyTerra\u2019s McIntyre. There\u2019s still a path for geological hydrogen to succeed, but it\u2019s not the only route to decarbonizing H2. Chinese companies already claim to be able to produce green hydrogen from splitting water molecules with wind and solar power for less than 20 yuan ($2.78) per kilogram, with prices worldwide expected to decline toward $1/kg as the technology rolls out this decade. Mined green hydrogen will need to decisively undercut those numbers if it\u2019s to compete.Right now, there\u2019s a gold rush brewing in green H2. If they don\u2019t hit pay dirt, though, the current wave of prospectors will move on to the next hot commodity. Geological hydrogen is enjoying its moment in the sun. It had better start showing results soon.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Two global investment giants EQT Capital and Temasek have decided to sell renewable energy platform O2 Power, aiming to monetise their five-year-old investment, according to people aware of the matter.Barclays has been appointed to initiate a formal sale process. Approaches will be made to global infrastructure funds and energy companies. This comes as close to a dozen transactions centred on renewable assets in India are at various stages of implementation. Those involved include the Aditya Birla Group, Brookfield and Macquarie Infrastructure among others.Swedish-origin EQT Infrastructure Partners had joined hands with Temasek and former Renew Power executives in 2019 to start O2 Power. EQT Infrastructure\u2019s parent EQT Capital later acquired Baring Private Equity Asia to create one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world, spanning private equity, credit and infrastructure. The former Renew Power executives included COO Parag Sharma and VP, Strategy, Peeyush Mohit.Sponsors EQT and Temasek had deployed $500 million as seed equity capital for 51% and 49%, respectively.Portfolio ChurnThe senior management and founding team have a differentiated economic incentive structure.Currently, O2 Power has 1.8 GW of operational solar and wind and commercial and industrial (C&I) projects that will be ramped up to 2 GW by March 2024. Over the next financial year, another 1.5 GW capacity is expected to get added with an aim to touch 5GW by FY26. The company has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 3 GW already. It is among the trio that completed 1 GW greenfield capacity addition in 2023, along with Adani Green and Renew Power, said people in the know.Of the $500 million committed, only $400 million has thus far been drawn down. One of the people cited above said another $500 million has been committed by the two sponsors, as growth equity.The two sponsors of O2 are expecting an equity valuation of $1-1.2 billion, a combination of secondary as well as primary capital infusion. The platform currently has $700-800 million of debt. Upon completion of 4 GW, that number is expected to treble to a little over $2 billion. The deal size could thus be close to $2.5-3 billion of enterprise valuation, keeping the entire 4 GW rollout plan in mind.Temasek and EQT declined to comment.\u201cWith the life of several funds expiring, several financial institutions are churning their portfolios,\u201d said the CEO of a homegrown green energy producer. \u201cAdditionally, returns from these power generation projects have improved from a paltry 11-122% IRR (internal rate of return) to 17-18% IRR as the latest tenders are all hybrid in nature with pumped or battery storage in the mix to ensure firm renewable power supply.\u201dPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ambitious target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 as part of getting to net zero by 2070, has been partially met, with the country having touched 170 GW in 2023. In FY23, solar power accounted for the largest share at 53.36%, followed by wind at 34.06%.\u201cRenewable energy grows strongly in all scenarios, at an average of 4-6% a year. As a result, renewable energy becomes the largest source of primary energy in 2050 in accelerated and net zero, and the largest together with coal in new momentum,\u201d said BP chief economist Spencer Dale.Solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity will continue to increase in 2024 while challenges remain for wind expansion, according to the International Energy Agency.\u201cDeclining module prices, greater uptake of distributed solar PV systems and a policy push for large-scale deployment are driving higher annual solar additions in all major markets \u2014 including China, the European Union, the United States and India,\u201d it said recently.EQT, with its roots in the Wallenburg family behind Swedish giants such as ABB, Ericsson, Saab and Electrolux, had launched O2 from its infrastructure fund IV. Earlier this year, it announced the launch of its infrastructure fund VI that aims to raise 21 billion euros, making it one of the largest capital pools for hard infrastructure assets worldwide.Temasek is an old India backer, being one of the largest foreign institutional investors in both public and private markets. From ICICI Bank to Manipal Hospitals to Adani Ports, Ola Electric, Zomato, Info Edge, Tata Play L&T Electrical & Automation Business to CG Power among others, it has deployed $17 billion in the country. India accounts for 6% of the investment company\u2019s total portfolio of $287 billion, from 5% in 2022 and 3% five years ago. It is also present in India through portfolio companies such as CapitaLand, Sembcorp Industries, Singapore Airlines and Keppel Corporation. 108186045",

        "articleBody": "India can be one of the key players in the Hydrogen sector which could be a USD 0.5 trillion industry by 2050, according to a study.As per a white paper published by Alvarez & Marsal, India alongside North Africa, Latin America, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and the U.S. could be central to the future of green hydrogen production.The Hydrogen industry is poised to serve 10-20 percent of the world's energy demand by 2050 and will be a crucial element in the global transition towards decarbonization, it added. By 2050, the demand for hydrogen is expected to surge by five times, it claimed.The increasing global temperatures and extreme climate events caused by the industrial age have created an urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, annual emissions are around 53 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, with energy production from fossil fuels accounting for 66% of these emissions. In 2021, 82% of total energy production was derived from fossil fuels, while only 20% came from renewable sources. However, this is expected to change by 2050, with renewable energy projected to contribute 52% to electricity production in a net-zero scenario. While renewable energy is growing, the Alvarez & Marsal study emphasizes on the importance of hydrogen, specifically green hydrogen, in decarbonizing sectors that cannot be electrified. Currently, 95 million tonnes of hydrogen are produced annually, mainly for refineries and fertilizer production, using fossil fuels and releasing high levels of CO2. The report highlights two alternative methods for producing low-carbon hydrogen: utilizing carbon capture to create blue hydrogen and generating green hydrogen through water electrolysis using renewable electricity. This is especially important for industries like steel manufacturing, heavy-duty transport, and high-temperature manufacturing processes, where electrification is not feasible. To address these issues, it is crucial to shift towards renewable energy sources and explore the potential of green hydrogen. ",

        "articleBody": "The VOC Port at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu will become India's first green hydrogen hub as it will develop an ecosystem of green ports and also emerge as a transshipment hub when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launches numerous initiatives on February 28, Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said on Tuesday. Also, Chennai would become the gateway to the Eastern Maritime Corridor to Vladivostok, Russia, and further increase the bilateral trade between the two countries, he said.  Tomorrow PM Modi will lay the foundation stone, inaugurate, and dedicate to the nation 36 transformative projects worth over Rs 17,000 crore. This is a step towards Viksit Bharat @2047,  Sonowal told reporters here. About 30 projects under his Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways worth Rs 10,324 crore would be inaugurated, foundation laid or dedicated by the prime minister, he said. Of these, six projects worth Rs 7,587 crore are only in the two ports in Tamil Nadu.  Only a few years ago, our prime minister had announced that the government will take steps to make VOC Port as the transshipment hub on the east coast of India. Tomorrow this guarantee is going to be fulfilled,  Sonowal said. Development of the Outer Harbour Container Terminal project at VOC Port, costing Rs 7,056 crore, will position it as a major transshipment hub on the east coast of India. This project will increase the container capacity of VOC Port Authority by many times and would significantly boost the state economy, he said. Further, it would reduce the logistics cost, and time thereby saving thousands of crores annually. The VOC Port will be India's first green hydrogen hub for large-scale production. Already 500 acres of land has been earmarked and a MoU has been signed with NTPC for installing a green hydrogen production facility, the union minister said. For the first time in the country, an indigenously developed hydrogen fuel cell ferry built by Cochin Shipyard Limited will be launched as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat. This zero-emission, zero-noise vessel is a revolutionary step towards India becoming a hydrogen fuel vessel manufacturer, he said. The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) will convert the existing two ships to run on green hydrogen and it has been targeted to convert at least 50 per cent of all tugs into green tugs by 2030, he said. The Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor would significantly reduce the time required to transport cargo between India and Far East Russia by upto 16 days - from 40 to 24 days - besides considerably reducing the distance by upto 40 per cent. Presently, the distance between Mumbai Port and the Port of St. Petersburg, by the Western Sea Route via Suez Canal, is 16,066 km, whereas the distance from Chennai Port to Vladivostok Port via the Eastern Maritime Corridor is only 10,458 km, he said, and added this would help in reducing logistics costs immensely, apart from hugely boosting the efficiency in transportation of cargo between the two countries.",

        "articleBody": "State-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) on Monday has cancelled the tender for setting up the first green hydrogen plant at the company's Panipat Refinery and Petrochemical Complex in Haryana following controversies over alleged conflict of interests with prospective bidders moving court to challenge the bid process which eventually saw a solo bid from a IOCL-led consortium. In a cancellation corrigendum issued on February 21, IOCL said, the tender stands cancelled. The company did not reply to an email sent till press time. Last August, IOCL had invited bids for setting up a green hydrogen generation unit of 10KTA ( (thousand tonnes per annum) capacity on a build, own, operate, transfer (boot) basis at its Panipat Refinery for 25 years. This tender became high profile as this was the first time the price of green hydrogen was to be decided through a bidding or a market driven exercise in the country, and thus was touted as a major milestone to India\u2019s hydrogen mission. The cancellation therefore is being seen as a major setback. The winner was to deliver hydrogen gas in 30 months from the date of issue of the letter of award. The project would have included 75 MW of electrolyser capacity, generating 300 MW of clean energy and a total capex of $400 million said industry participants. At 10 KTA capacity, this was to be among the largest green hydrogen plants in India. Green hydrogen is key in meeting India's net-zero emissions target by 2070, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the climate summit (COP) in Glasgow. However industry players cited several clauses in the bid document that they argued defeated a level playing field and was heavily skewed in favour of GH4India Pvt. Ltd, an equal joint venture between IOCL, engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and renewable energy company ReNew that was formed in 2022-2023 for the development of green hydrogen and its derivatives, including green ammonia and methanol, besides production assets and associated renewable assets through any model of ownership and operatorship. The key bone of contention for industry players was the right of first refusal clause incorporated in the tender notice. It said, the tender will be evaluated on the lowest levelized cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) basis after conducting reverse auction mechanism. The IOCL JV \u2013 was also allowed to bid and become lowest bidder during reverse auction. \u201cAlternatively, in case IOCL JV (GH4 India Private Limited) bids for the tender but does not participate in the reverse auction or fails to become the lowest bidder, it would be allowed to match the LCOH of lowest bidder determined through reverse auction process. Most industry players said such a clause goes against public procurement rules of Government of India as a public sector undertaking (IOCL) was advocating a public private joint venture to have the first right of refusal. \u201cThis is a direct conflict of interest. The procurer IOCL is also a 33.4% equity shareholder in the JV company that was getting preferential treatment in a global tender process,\u201d said a CEO of a global industrial gas company who evaluated the tender but did not bid eventually, on condition of anonymity. \u201cThis defeats the spirit of competitive bidding.\u201d  The right of first refusal clause kept companies away. Such a clause discourages competitive bidding. The tender was unfair,  he said. According to the right of first refusal clause, IOCL would have got preferential right to purchase excess green hydrogen generated at unit. In case IOCL does not confirm the purchase within 60 days, the operator is free to offer the hydrogen gas to third-party customers. However, the price offered to them cannot be lower than what was offered to IOCL. As part of additional instructions to bidders, IOCL had said it reserves the right to accept a bid other than the lowest and to accept or reject any bid in whole or part, or to reject all bids with or without assigning any reasons. \u201cSuch decision by IOCL shall bear no liability whatsoever consequent upon such decisions,\u201d the document said. Industry players also demanded this clause be scrapped in order for transparency. Industry players also demanded a take or pay clause in case IOCL failed to offtake the contracted amount annually. These clauses ensured that even though over 50 players had participated in the pre-bid consultation, only GH4 India submitted the bid and was the sole bidder for the tender in the end. Global industrial gas suppliers like Air Products or Linde who supply a lion\u2019s share of hydrogen to Indian industry and refineries stayed away from the bidding despite initial participation, said sources aware. The industry body Independent Green Hydrogen Producers\u2019 Association (IGHPA) approached the Delhi High Court in November 2023, alleging bias in the tender clauses. Azure Power, Acme Group, Fortum India, O2 Power, Sprng Energy, and SunEdison Infrastructure are part of IGHPA. Queries sent to L&T and Renew remained unanswered till press time. An official aware of the development said IOCL considered it best to cancel the tender as going ahead could have invited further legal wrangles.",

        "articleBody": "Despite worsening air quality in several parts of North India and pollution levels posing a threat to the health of people, stubble burning continues in Punjab and also in a few other northern states.Amid high pollution levels in the national capital in November last year, Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri met Claudius da Costa Gomez, CEO of the German Biogas Association to find a solution to stubble burning as Germany is a world leader in producing biogas from stubble.An estimated 352 MT of stubble is generated each year in India. 22 per cent of this comes from wheat crop and 34 per cent from rice. About 84 MT (23.86 per cent) of this stubble is burnt on-field annually, immediately after harvest.Biogas can be produced from various organic waste sources such as agricultural waste, including the stubble which is burnt by farmers and is a major cause of pollution in the national capital in winters.Reliance biogas planIn August, Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced at the 46th AGM of the company that RIL had become the largest bio-energy producer based on its indigenously developed technology, an endeavour the company embarked on to help Indian cities fight pollution created by stubble burning.\u201cAfter setting up two demo units for Compressed Biogas (CBG) at Jamnagar, we have commissioned the first commercial-scale CBG plant at Barabanki in UP in a record time of just 10 months. We will rapidly scale this up to 25 CBG plants across India,\u201d Ambani said.Reliance wants to establish 100 such CBG plants in the next 5 years, consuming 5.5 million tonnes of agro-residue and organic waste, thereby mitigating nearly 2 million tonnes of carbon emissions, and producing 2.5 million tonnes of organic manure annually.This would result in a reduction of about 0.7 MMTPA of imported LNG, Ambani said. India had imported 20.7 MMTPA of LNG in 2022. India produces nearly 230 million tonnes of non-cattle feed biomass, most of it contributing to air pollution. Within a short span of one year, we have become India's largest bio-energy producer based on our indigenously developed technology,  Ambani had said at the AGM.Now, ET has reported that RIL is planning to set up more than 50 compressed biogas (CBG) plants in the next two years at a cost of over ?5,000 crore.Jio-BP, a fuel retail joint venture between RIL and British oil major BP, plans to retail CBG and bio-CNG (B-CNG), both of which can be used in place of compressed natural gas in CNG-powered vehicles.Why biogas is important for India?Biogas can improve India's energy security, as the country is currently heavily reliant on imported natural gas to meet its energy needs. The proposed 5 per cent blending of biogas with natural gas supplies in the country can cut LNG imports worth $1.17 billion annually, says a study by the Indian Biogas Association (IBA).The study comes against the backdrop of the government's recent mandate to blend one per cent biogas with piped natural gas (PNG) supplies in the country from April 1, 2025 under the compressed biogas blending obligation (CBO) scheme. The biogas blending is proposed to be further increased to 5 per cent by fiscal year 2028\u201329.This blending initiative gels well with the government's macro-level move to make India a gas-based economy, with a target to increase the current share of gas in the energy mix from 6 per cent currently to 15 per cent by 2030, as per the study.While the targeted 5 per cent blending of biogas with natural gas can reduce LNG imports worth $1.17 billion, this can also bring down per capita CO2 emissions by 2 per cent, benchmarked to the 2019 figure, which was 1.9 metric tonne of CO2 per person in India. Additionally, the body says preventing organic waste going to landfills can bring innumerable benefits.The mandatory CNG blending will encourage investment of around Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the establishment of at least 750 compressed bio gas (CBG) projects by 2028\u201329, as per government estimates.Despite its evident advantages, biogas hasn't gained substantial traction in India. The study suggests that the primary obstacles are an underdeveloped market ecosystem for pricing and offtake, convoluted clearance and permission procedures for project inception, and fragmented government support mechanisms. If parali is used as feedstock, production becomes more expensive because the post-harvest supply chain management and gas transportation infrastructure need extensive investment.In 2018, as part of the National Policy on Biofuels, the government launched the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme to push CBG. SATAT envisaged developing 5,000 CBG plants by 2023-24, mobilising investments of ?1.75 lakh crore and creating 75,000 direct jobs. So far, India has failed to achieve even 1% of this number. However, recently, besides Reliance, nearly half a dozen public and private energy companies have announced plans to set up over 100 CBG plants in the next few years. ",

        "articleBody": "Adani New Industries Ltd. is in talks to raise up to $3 billion for capital expenditure, according to people familiar with the matter, as the unit of India\u2019s ports-to-power conglomerate aims to become a major player in the country\u2019s green hydrogen push. The company is discussing the planned transaction with a group of foreign lenders and is likely to raise the money via offshore loans in two or three tranches over the next 12 months, with the process starting in June, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. The loan\u2019s tenor could range from three to five years, with the pricing likely linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, they said. Lenders discussing the credit facility with the company include DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank AG, First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC, ING Bank NV, MUFG Bank and Standard Chartered Bank Plc.Adani Group representative did not offer any immediate comment. Adani New Industries plans to begin production of the clean fuel from 2027 in the western state of Gujarat, and could invest as much as $50 billion over 10 years, according to the company. Proceeds from the fundraising could be used to support this plan, the people said. Tycoons like Gautam Adani and rivals including Mukesh Ambani are firming up plans for clean hydrogen production as Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes the technology as a major part of the nation\u2019s effort to hit net zero emissions by 2070. Modi, who is seeking a third term, has set an ambitious range of climate goals over the past decade. These include lifting the share of clean-power capacity in its electricity mix to 50% by the end of the decade, from around 40% now, and guiding the economy toward net zero by 2070.",

        "articleBody": "The government is working on a draft scheme for firm and dispatchable round-the-clock renewable energy using green hydrogen as storage, people familiar with the development said. The plan under the National Green Hydrogen Mission may offer financial assistance in the form of contract for difference (CFD) or viability gap funding, they said. An initial 100 MW capacity pilot project could be considered under the scheme, they said. Discussions are on,  said one of the persons. The government is examining options for financial assistance, which could also be from the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM), the person added. This will mark the first step in the bundling of green hydrogen to generate round-the-clock power. Green hydrogen refers to gas produced using renewable sources. The NGHM was launched in January 2023 with an initial outlay of \u20b919,744 crore, which included \u20b917,490 crore for the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) programme and \u20b91,466 crore for pilot projects.107952648Corpus may be Notified Separately | page 5 This also included Rs 400 crore for research and development and Rs 388 crore toward other components. The amount (for the funding) will depend on the final structure of the scheme,  the person said, adding that the corpus could be notified separately.Under the norms for the scheme under discussion, if financial support is provided through VGF, the government could invite bids on either the tariff offered by the project or the amount of funding.In the case of contract for difference, if a developer has bid a certain tariff for availing of the funding, it will sell the power on the exchanges at that rate with a certain permissible variation, and any difference may be settled through the corpus and vice versa, the person said.To ensure viability of the project, a comparison between the capital costs, cycle efficiencies for battery energy storage systems and green hydrogen as storage is being prepared, another person said.Power and renewable energy minister RK Singh had, in September, said a pilot project aimed at generating 100 MW of round-the-clock power using green hydrogen as storage was in the works. The minister had said that the cost of such power was estimated at around Rs 6 per unit.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's installed Renewable Energy (RE) capacity, excluding large hydro plants, is estimated to increase to 170 GW by March 2025 from a level of 135 GW in December 2023, rating agency ICRA said on Friday.  ICRA estimates that the rise in the RE capacity over the next five-six years is estimated to enhance the share of RE plus large hydro in the all-India electricity generation from about 23 per cent in FY24 to around 40 per cent in FY30,  ICRA said in a statement.  Given the intermittency associated with RE generation, the availability of Round The Clock (RTC) supply from RE sources remains important, it stated.  This can be made possible through the use of wind and solar power projects complemented with energy storage systems, it suggested.  According to the statement, ICRA expects the installed RE capacity, excluding hydro energy, in India to increase to about 170 GW by March 2025 from 135 GW as of December 2023.  Thereafter, the capacity addition is likely to be supported by the significant improvement in tendering activity in the current fiscal with over 16 GW projects bid so far, and another 17 GW bids underway by central nodal agencies, it stated.  This is in line with the 50 GW annual bidding trajectory announced by the Government of India in March 2023, it noted.  Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice-President and Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said in the statement that the tariffs discovered in the RE-RTC tenders remain higher as against the standalone solar and wind energy tenders, with recent RTC bid tariffs seen in the range of Rs 4-4.5 per unit, mainly on account of the cost associated with the storage component and higher share of wind energy component expected.  Further, based on the prevailing capital cost of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Pumped Hydro Storage Projects (PSP), the viability of the RTC projects remains relatively better with the use of PSP capacity, he said.  Nonetheless, the supply chain challenges in the wind energy segment could pose challenges for execution of RTC projects, he said.  As per ICRA, the sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices, abeyance of the Approved List of Module Manufacturers (ALMM) order till March 2024 and the timeline extension approved for solar and hybrid projects, is expected to lead to an improvement in RE capacity addition to 18 GW to 20 GW in FY24 from 15 GW in FY23.  This, along with the growing project pipeline, is likely to support the scale-up in capacity addition to 23-25 GW in FY25, as per ICRA estimates, mainly driven by the solar power segment.  However, it stated that challenges remain on the execution front with respect to delays in land acquisition and transmission connectivity, which could hamper the capacity-addition prospects.  Kadam added that the sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices by 65 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, over the past 12 months is leading to a healthy improvement in debt coverage metrics for the upcoming solar power projects.  Benefitting from this, for a solar power project with a bid tariff of Rs 2.5 per unit and sourcing modules from domestic OEMs using imported PV cells, the average DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) has improved over 35 basis points, he said.  DSCR is a measure of the cash flow available to pay current debt obligations.  While this is positive in the near term, the developers would remain exposed to movement in imported solar PV cell and wafer prices, till fully integrated module manufacturing units are developed in India, he said.  State distribution utilities (discoms) have shown an improved discipline in making payments to power generators, including RE IPPs (Power Producers), following the implementation of the late payment surcharge rules in June 2022, it stated.",

        "articleBody": "The RP Sanjiv Goenka Group, with revenue exceeding USD 4 billion, has expressed interest in exploring investment opportunities in the Northeast, including renewable energy. The group officials had a preliminary one-on-one meeting with the Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), B L Verma. He was in Kolkata for an investment roadshow for the northeast and met a few business houses from the region to understand the sectors and how the government can assist in taking forward the projects.  According to sources, the RP Sanjiv Goenka Group has expressed willingness to explore hydropower opportunities besides evaluating other sectors. Hydropower holds immense potential in the Northeast. Arunachal Pradesh government already had signed MoUs with central public sector undertakings to construct 13 projects likely to generate 13,000 MW of power and draw investment worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore. CESC Ltd, the flagship company of the group, had already announced that it was exploring possibilities to make substantial investments in renewable energy generation of up to 3 GW in a hybrid portfolio through its subsidiaries in more than one state in the country. The company's green ambition envisages a mix of solar, wind, and green hydrogen projects.  We are carrying out a study exploring increasing our renewable energy footprint and partially meeting renewables purchase obligations of our distribution business,  the company had said recently. The company was looking to acquire over 50,000 acres of land in Rajasthan and Gujarat to fuel its 3 GW green energy dream with solar power. About 250 acres in Bikaner is under physical possession and an application has been submitted for Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation registration and transmission connectivity is in advanced stages of acquisition for another 2,000 acres, the company had stated earlier. The group has interests in business sectors including power (CESC), IT services First Source), carbon black (PCBL), retail (Spencer's), FMCG, real estate, education, and sports.",

        "articleBody": "India will invite private firms to invest about $26 billion in its nuclear energy sector to increase the amount of electricity from sources that don't produce carbon dioxide emissions, two government sources told Reuters. This is the first time New Delhi is pursuing private investment in nuclear power, a non-carbon-emitting energy source that contributes less than 2% of India's total electricity generation. The funding would help India to achieve its target of having 50% of its installed electric generation capacity use non-fossil fuels by 2030, up from 42% now. The government is in talks with at least five private firms including Reliance Industries, Tata Power, Adani Power and Vedanta Ltd to invest around 440 billion rupees ($5.30 billion) each, the two sources, who are directly involved in the matter, said last week. The federal Department of Atomic Energy and state-run Nuclear Power Corp of India Ltd (NPCIL) have held multiple rounds of discussions with the private companies in the past year on the investment plan, the sources said. The Department of Atomic Energy, NPCIL, Tata Power, Reliance Industries, Adani Power and Vedanta did not respond to queries sent by Reuters. With the investment, the government hopes to build 11,000 megawatts (MW) of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2040, said the sources, who did not want to be identified as the plan is still being finalised. NPCIL owns and operates India's current fleet of nuclear power plants, with a capacity of 7,500 MW, and has committed investments for another 1,300 MW. The sources said under the funding plan the private companies will make the investments in the nuclear plants, acquire land, water and undertake construction in areas outside the reactor complex of the plants. But, the rights to build and run the stations and their fuel management will rest with NPCIL, as allowed under the law, they said. The private companies are expected to earn revenue from the power plant's electricity sales and NPCIL would operate the projects for a fee, the sources said.  This hybrid model of nuclear power project development is an innovative solution to accelerate the nuclear capacity,  said Charudatta Palekar, an independent power sector consultant who formerly worked for PwC. The plan will not require any amendment to the India's Atomic Energy Act of 1962 but will need a final go-ahead from the Department of Atomic Energy, said one of the two sources. Indian law bars private companies from setting up nuclear power plants but allows them to supply components, equipment and sign construction contracts for work outside of the reactors. New Delhi has not met its nuclear power capacity addition targets for years mainly because it could not procure nuclear fuel supplies. However in 2010, India struck a deal with the United States for supplies of reprocessed nuclear fuel. India's stringent nuclear compensation laws have hampered talks with foreign power plant builders such as General Electric and Westinghouse. The country has deferred a target to add 2,000 MW of nuclear power from 2020 to 2030.",

This will provide round-the-clock power to utilities and group captive consumers of commercial and industrial segments and help meet their renewable energy obligations,  Sinha said.The bundling will combine solar, wind and pumped hydro energy, he said.Pumped hydro storage has come into focus in recent years as the intermittent nature of renewable energy projects has been a challenge for grid stability.Both pumped hydro storage and battery energy storage solutions will gain prominence in India's electricity system, according to a report by Deloitte and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. A framework for pumped storage power projects was announced in the interim budget for 2023-24.Pumped hydro storage is a two-reservoir system at different elevations that acts like a giant battery. When a renewable project has surplus power, it uses that to pump water to the higher reservoir. Overall, there is 97 GW of pumped hydro storage potential in India, with 40 GW in the western part of the country, according to industry experts.The Central Electricity Authority estimates an on-river pumped storage potential of 103 GW in India. A large capacity of off-river pumped storage potential is also available, estimates for which are being worked out.  We have our own reservoirs, and we don't have to look outside for it,  Sinha said.",

The group may soon make a an announcement in this regard in the coming months, HFE' Global Chief Executive Officer Srivatsan Iyer told the website.Iyer said, \u201cGreen hydrogen is a focal area of interest for us. We are actively engaging with various customers across India to explore diverse project opportunities. We anticipate making some announcements in the coming months as these discussions progress and materialise into concrete initiatives.\u201d However, HFE clarified that they are not planning to produce green hydrogen electrolysers. Although they signed a strategic MoU with Ohmium, an electrolyser company based in Bangalore, they will continue to source from the market and adopt the best available technology.HFE has partnered with Ohmium International to develop 1,000 MW of green hydrogen production facilities in India, the UK, and the rest of Europe.On this year's budget allocation for green hydrogen, Iyer expressed positivity but emphasized the need for demand mandates. He suggested that the government should consider implementing certain levels of demand mandates to kickstart the sector. Currently, the major consumers in industries like refining and fertilizers are hesitant to adopt green hydrogen due to the high cost compared to traditional sources. Increasing adoption through demand mandates would help bring down the cost and accelerate the adoption of green hydrogen.In terms of making green hydrogen available to the public, Iyer proposed two possibilities. One is blending it in the city gas distribution system, starting with a low level of blending as safety standards are established. The other is using green hydrogen in heavy-duty mobility, such as retrofitting existing internal combustion engine vehicles with hydrogen fuel in long-distance trucks or buses.The company currently has a global portfolio of 3 GW of renewable energy assets while another 2 GW of projects are in the pipeline.",

        "articleBody": "The Niti Aayog is working to project the potential gap between states' renewable energy capacities and their future electricity needs under existing purchase obligations to help them plan their power resources, a senior government official said. We have assessed the potential of these states related to solar, wind or hydro to figure if they will be able to meet renewable purchase obligations (RPOs) with their own resources or depend on other states for it,  the official told ET.The timelines for the analysis and projection are for 2030 and 2047, another official said. The gap analysis is based on the power load curve of the states and available capacities, the first official said.In the latest renewable purchase obligations issued by the government, the total RPO for FY25 is at 29.9% of the total energy consumption and for FY30, it is at 43.3%. The government's policy think tank has also been working on the carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology facilitation policy. There are four subcommittees with all stakeholders in the CCUS technology comprising carbon capture, transportation and storage, utilisation, and on standards, the official said.  All these sub-committees are finalising their reports after which there will be stakeholders' consultation for policy,  the person said. CCUS involves the capture of CO2, generally from large point sources like power generation or industrial facilities that use fossil fuels.",

        "articleBody": "Scaling up demand should be a priority for countries aiming for green or clean hydrogen production and export so that such projects become successful, said Keisuke Sadamori, director, energy markets and security, International Energy Agency. We need to see the governments and industries work on expanding that consumption, otherwise those hydrogen (green or clean) projects will not be able to fly,  Sadamori told ET on Thursday.There have been a lot of announcements on the production and export of green hydrogen, but not on the offtake and demand side developments, the IEA official said. With demand-side push, the production of green or low-carbon hydrogen will gather pace, he said.India's vast renewable energy resources, along with economic growth, provides a good opportunity for the demand side to grow, he said. While India is rooting for green hydrogen, some other countries are aiming for low-carbon hydrogen, mainly through carbon capture utilisation and storage technology, also known as 'blue hydrogen'. India's National Green Hydrogen mission, launched in January 2023, has set a target of at least 5 million metric tonnes of annual production capacity by 2030.The future of hydrogen was widely discussed in the G20 summit in 2023 where India suggested green hydrogen for transition, while countries such as Saudi Arabia and the US wanted to include 'low-carbon hydrogen'.  At this moment we should not mind colours (for hydrogen) but look at the carbon intensity of the process for producing it,  Sadamori said.However, in the long term, green hydrogen should prevail because that is the most sustainable form, he said.  At least in the short term, 'blue hydrogen' may have the cost advantage,  he said, adding that as long as there is 'low carbon' hydrogen from that source, that option should be explored.",

        "articleBody": "Royal Enfield, the popular Chennai-based motorcycle manufacturer, is planning to introduce a new variant of its well-loved Classic 350 model. This new model, called the Classic 350 'Flex Fuel', was recently showcased at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in New Delhi. While maintaining the iconic design of the regular Classic 350, the Flex Fuel model will be available in different color, featuring a striking metallic green fuel tank with red livery, a single seat, and wire-spoke wheels.What sets this new model apart is its ability to run on flex fuel, which is a blend of petrol and ethanol. Ethanol is an alcohol-based biofuel derived from renewable sources such as sugarcane or corn. The ethanol content in flex fuel vehicles can be adjusted according to availability and regulations, typically ranging from 10% to 85%. Royal Enfield's Classic 350 'Flex Fuel' model, according to the company's spec sheet, can run on an ethanol mix of up to 85%. The powerful 350cc engine generates 20 horsepower and 27 Nm of peak torque, paired with a 5-speed gearbox.While the manufacturer has not yet announced a specific launch date for this new model, it is expected to hit the streets sometime next year. It is worth mentioning that there are already several models in India that can run on E20 petrol, which contains a 20% ethanol mix. As technology and infrastructure continue to advance, we can anticipate the blending percentage to increase in the future.",

        "articleBody": "Interim Budget: Coal gasification and liquefaction of 100 metric tonne will be set up by 2030, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday. In January, the government approved an outlay of Rs 8,500 crore as financial assistance for promoting coal, lignite gasification projects.  The government has also approved setting up of a coal-to-SNG (Synthetic Natural Gas) project through a joint venture between Coal India and GAIL at an investment of Rs 13,052.81 crore and coal-to-ammonium nitrate project through a joint venture between CIL and BHEL for Rs 11,782.05 crore.  The decision is a significant step as it helps reduce import of chemicals, which can be derived through coal gasification.  She said India has received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow of USD 596 billion since 2014, which is double the inflow between 2004 and 2014.  She added that the government has launched Blue Economy 2.0 to promote aquaculture in the country.",

        "articleBody": "Five years after entering the renewable energy sector in India, Canadian investor Brookfield Asset Management is looking to partially monetise its clean energy assets. Among the largest infrastructure investors in the world, it plans to offload assets with a capacity of about 1.6 GW, said people aware of the matter. A potential deal is likely to value them at `9,000-10,000 crore ($1-1.2 billion) enterprise value, inclusive of debt, they said.Currently, Brookfield has about 20 GW of wind and solar assets in operation or in the development pipeline across India. Investment bank JP Morgan has been hired to run the process, said the people cited above.Of the 1.6 GW, 1 GW is operational. Close to 600 MW of projects are under construction, expected to be completed by year-end. Brookfield may add another 500-600 MW of assets, likely to be completed in the next two years, to those on the block, the people cited said. The holdings that will be divested include capacities of 500 MW in Rajasthan, 50 MW in Gujarat, 300 MW in south India and 80 MW in Madhya Pradesh.  107302602A Brookfield spokesperson declined to comment.The Canadian company has expanded its India clean energy portfolio through multiple acquisitions and greenfield projects.In 2017, it bought US renewable energy company SunEdison\u2019s solar yieldco TerraForm Global Inc, which gave Brookfield a 300MW portfolio of renewable assets in India.In 2019, Brookfield entered the Indian renewables space with the direct acquisition of wind farms from Hyderabad-based Axis Energy Ventures for Rs 500 crore.It also picked up 51% in CleanMax Enviro in 2023, with an equity investment of Rs 3,000 crore.Brookfield Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II) has committed equity capital of up to $845 million (Rs 7,280 crore) in Brookfield-Axis Energy Ventures JV. In April, BGTF agreed to invest up to $1 billion in Avaada Ventures for its green hydrogen and green ammonia ventures in India.In 2022, Brookfield sold its portfolio of Indian road assets to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in a deal valued at Rs 9,375 crore ($1.2 billion, as per currency conversion rates at the time).INFRA INVESTMENTSBrookfield has deployed about $25 billion in India since entry in 2014. Its major infrastructure moves include a Rs 25,215-crore investment in Jio Towers, a Rs 21,000-crore deal to buy ATC India and a Rs13,000-crore buyout of East-West Pipeline (formerly Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure).Key potential deals in the Indian renewable energy space include Shell offloading a significant stake in the operational assets of Sprng Energy and Macquarie Group\u2019s sale of Vibrant Energy, which provides electricity to corporate and industrial (C&I) customers.Italian Group Enel is also exploring the sale of its 750 MW operational assets in India.India has attracted investments of Rs 1.32 lakh crore in the renewable energy sector in the past three years. Installed renewable energy capacity is expected to increase to about 170 GW by March 2025 from 132 GW in October 2023, according to research agency Icra.India is expected to see an increase of more than 83% in renewable energy investments to around $16.5 billion in 2024, as the country focuses on energy transition, according to Union minister RK Singh.",

        "articleBody": "Hydrogen Intelligence SA, a Paris-based group company of electric vehicle maker Omega Seiki Mobility (OSM), has developed green hydrogen-powered three-wheelers that it plans to commercially produce in India next year.\u201cWe will be running these vehicles for 500 kilometres on the Lemans racetrack on February 2 at an event in Paris,\u201d Uday Narang, cofounder of Hydrogen Intelligence, told ET. \u201cThese have been developed by our team of French engineers.\u201dThe India subsidiary of Hydrogen Intelligence plans to make a batch of 100 such three-wheelers by September for an extensive pilot run in various states in the country, Narang said.Subsequently, it would commence commercial production at an upcoming new facility in Chennai in early 2025, he said. The plant will have an initial capacity to make 5,000 vehicles per month, which will be doubled in the second year of operation, he added.The development is expected to complement the government\u2019s National Green Hydrogen Mission that aims to make India a global hub for production, use and exports of green hydrogen.So far, automakers in India have been considering electric and not hydrogen as the most preferred solution for small commercial vehicles like a three-wheeler to switch to zero emission technologies.Truck makers such as Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Daimler India Commercial Vehicles, though, are actively considering this fuel option for long haulage, heavy duty applications and have been running pilots of their hydrogen-powered trucks at ports and refineries for some time now.Hydrogen Intelligence is presently in talks with private equity investors in the US and Europe to raise $25 million.The Paris-based firm plans to sell its three-wheelers in India at about Rs 6 lakh each.While this is about Rs 2 lakh higher than a battery-operated three-wheeler, the total cost of ownership would be much lesser and one can recover the initial cost at a shorter time span, Narang claimed.For one, battery-operated vehicles (BOVs) need to replace their batteries \u2013 which cost one-third of the vehicle \u2013 every three years, he reasoned.Also, BOVs\u2019 batteries typically need to be recharged after every 100 km. In the case of hydrogen-powered vehicles, \u201cthe operator doesn\u2019t need to fill the tank for 3 to 4 days\u201d, Narang claimed.While several top public and private companies including Reliance Industries, Tata Group, Adani Green Energy and NTPC are investing in green hydrogen plants, the fuel is not yet readily available in the country.On how the company plans to run these vehicles after the pilot runs in India in the absence of hydrogen-dispensing infrastructure, Narang said, \u201cSomeone needs to take charge. These vehicles will act as a catalyst of change\u2026 Till a few years back, no one thought electric will catch up so fast.\u201dHe said Hydrogen Intelligence will engage with state governments and various stakeholders including Reliance and Adani for the adequate infrastructure support required.Bringing disruptive technologies is the only way a startup like Omega Seiki Mobility (OSM) can take on large manufacturers like Bajaj Auto that controls 70% of the market, Narang said.OSM currently sells electric three-wheelers under the brand Charge+ and is in the process of launching a passenger carrier version of the same in a few months. It targets sales of 8,000 e-three-wheelers in the domestic market in 2023-24.",

The study, titled  India's Transition to E-cooking  by the Centre for Science and Environment, highlights that the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana has not ensured a sustained transition to clean cooking. Globally, 2.4 billion people lack access to clean cooking solutions, resulting in significant damage to the economy, public health, and the environment. Indoor air pollution from wood-based cooking causes about 3 million premature deaths annually, with 0.6 million in India. ",

        "articleBody": "Forty-one percent of the Indian population still uses wood, cow dung or other biomass as cooking fuel and cumulatively emits around 340 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the environment every year, which is about 13 per cent of India's greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new report. The report  India's Transition to E-cooking  by the independent think tank Centre for Science and Environment also said that the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana led to a rapid expansion in access to liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in India, but it has  not guaranteed a sustained transition to clean cooking in households  that benefited from the scheme.  Around a third of the world's population - 2.4 billion people globally (including 500 million people in India) - still lack access to clean cooking solutions. This causes untold damage to the economy, public health and the environment.  Approximately three million people globally (including 0.6 million people in India) die prematurely every year because of indoor air pollution. These deaths are mostly caused by wood-based cooking, the report said, citing research conducted in the past.  Although the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG) claims that the country's household LPG  coverage  stands at 99.8 per cent, the National Family Health Survey conducted in 2019-21 (NFHS-5) shows that 41 per cent of the population still cooks on biomass, it said.   CSE's own calculations have found that this 41 per cent cumulatively emits -- when it cooks on wood, cow dung or other biomass - around 340 million tonnes of CO2 (carbon dioxide) into the environment every year, which is about 13 per cent of India's national GHG emissions,  the report said.  A review of India's last Biennial Update Report (BUR3) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change shows this particular sectoral emission is not counted as part of national emissions.  Through PMUY launched in May 2016, more than 100 million households in India received LPG cylinders by the end of March 2023.  However, over 50 per cent of the households that received new LPG cylinders under PMUY did not choose to refill it even once, the CSE said.   This was due to high costs of refill, cultural or behavioural beliefs, and a lack of significant LPG cylinder distribution networks where the beneficiaries lived,  the report said.  As of March 2023, the average cost for a refill of an LPG cylinder (14.2 kg) was approximately Rs 1,100 across India. The average Indian household requires eight such cylinders solely for cooking in a year. That translates to approximately Rs 8,800 spent on cooking fuel alone per year.  As per the NITI Aayog's Tenth Five-Year Plan, the average annual income of a Below Poverty Line (BPL) family is capped at Rs 27,000, which means an average BPL family (who are the primary beneficiaries of the PMUY scheme) have to spend one-third of their annual income on cooking fuel alone, the CSE said.",

        "articleBody": "Budget 2024: In the past few years, the Government of India has been pacing up its interventions to meet the ambitious clean energy targets, i.e. to steer the country towards 50% cumulative installed power generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030; and achieving net zero by 2070. India currently has an installed generation capacity of 187 GW from non-fossil fuel sources including 133 GW from renewable energy (RE) sources, as of November 2023.Read our full Budget 2024 coverage hereBetween 2016 and 2022, while India has seen a sharp acceleration in capacity addition of non-fossil fuel-based generation sources, the same has not exceeded 16 GW thus far on an annual basis. In comparison, the country needs an average annual capacity addition of about 49 GW, to achieve the target of 500 GW non-fossil fuel-based cumulative generation capacity by 2030. Availability of financing is a key enabler for fast tracking of RE capacity additions. The draft NEP prepared by CEA has estimated the funding requirement for solar and wind projects during 2022-2032 at Rs.20.67 Lakh crores. Budgetary measures undertaken by the Government not only play a critical role in promoting and supporting sustainable financing to accelerate implementation of RE projects but also emphasise its national significance.Annual budgets of the Government of India have provided the much needed impetus and direction to the RE sector by means of allocation of funds towards targeted programs as well as announcement of important decisions relating to taxation and import duties.Also Read| Sitharaman hints at govt's four focus areas ahead of Feb 1 For the upcoming budget for FY 2024-25, from the perspective of sustainable financing to support RE growth, a few areas such as distributed RE installations and localising the supply chain are expected to be on the priority list. Accelerating rooftop solar installations is likely to see a substantial boost in budgetary allocations, especially considering the recent announcement regarding 23% increase in per KW central financial assistance for up to 3KW installations under Phase-II of Rooftop Solar Scheme. Government\u2019s flagship schemes on RE which have social benefits also, such as the PM-KUSUM scheme and bio energy program, are also expected to receive a higher budgetary allocation. Subsidies provided under GOI schemes play a key role in improving the commercial viability of RE projects, thereby enabling their off-take, financing, and implementation.Another area of potential focus is the development of 4000 MWh of battery energy storage systems, where the Government has recently announced VGF support of up to 40% of project cost. It may be noted that allocations for green energy corridor, and capital (equity) infusions for key public sector entities relevant for RE such as Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) etc. are also likely to be covered in the budget process. Such investments allow these entities to issue more tenders (SECI) or increase the lending portfolio (IREDA), thereby driving capital investments on RE, including solar. The Government may also like to clarify its plan for further rounds of issue of sovereign green bonds to finance development of sustainable energy projects.Another important area likely to remain in focus is Government\u2019s thrust to accelerate investments towards indigenisation and innovations in the RE sector. PLI Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules is already in place and may see a further extension/ allocation of funds. Another area to watch out for will be the National Green Hydrogen Mission which may see an increased allocation in this year\u2019s budget as countries across the world have launched targeted programs with the ambition of emerging as leaders in this new energy segment.Also Read| Govt may go for big hike in PM-Kisan payout and a housing & jobs push On the taxation front, the Government has taken major decisions in the past which have substantially influenced the sector. Further interventions in such aspects will be linked to the Government's assessment of domestic manufacturing capability across the solar value chain and other RE equipment.Finally, there are more opportunities to tap, such as the use of India\u2019s startup ecosystem to drive innovations and growth in new age clean energy technologies. Considering the need for acceleration in non-fossil fuel-based generation capacity to ~50 GW per year, it is imperative that all available forms of interventions be explored through the budget as well as other instruments available with the Government.The authors are Partner, Deloitte India",

        "articleBody": "By 2030, India aims to source 50% of electric power from non-fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions by 45% from 2005 levels. To achieve this target, the 2023 National Electricity Plan by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has estimated the need for 486 GW of variable renewables (solar and wind). However, the high penetration of variable and intermittent renewable energy (RE) poses challenges such as grid balancing and underutilisation of the transmission system. These challenges can be solved through firm and dispatchable RE (FDRE) power, which is obtained by transforming the variable RE into FDRE through integration with energy storage systems (ESSs). Thus, as the name suggests, FDRE provides assured round-the-clock (RTC) power from green sources to consumers.As flexibility providers, ESSs can store surplus energy produced during peak times and release it during periods of high demand or when RE resources are less productive (the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing). Thus, ESSs empower RE to meet energy demands consistently, enhancing the efficiency and resilience of the grid. This improved reliability\u2014without compromising sustainability\u2014could be revolutionary for both industries and households.Ministry of Power (MoP) guidelines on FDRETo promote FDRE, MoP issued guidelines for competitive bidding of firm and dispatchable power from grid-connected RE projects with ESSs in June 2023. As per the guidelines, FDRE tenders will facilitate the provision of assured peak power and RTC power at any hour of the day as per demand specified by the distribution company (DISCOM). Further, RE generators integrated with ESSs need to supply power with a higher capacity utilisation factor (CUF), which is a measure of the actual output of an RE plant against its maximum possible output. In case of default, the RE generator will have to compensate the DISCOM at 1.5 times the tariff for the number of units not supplied. ESS tenders: Before and after the guidelinesPrior to the guidelines, ESS tenders were mainly issued for addressing peaking power requirements and providing RTC power. However, in these tenders, the ESS component was not mandatory, the yearly CUF of the RE varied across tenders, and there was a lack of clarity regarding the power requirement and its schedule.After the issuance of the MoP guidelines, stakeholders have gained more clarity on these aspects, leading to a noticeable increase in the number of tenders. As of today, Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) Ltd, SJVN Ltd, NHPC Ltd, and NTPC Ltd have issued FDRE tenders with a cumulative capacity of 11 GW. Among these tenders, only the SJVN tender has been concluded at a tariff of INR 4.38/kWh, which is considerably lower than that of many thermal power plants. Thus, these guidelines will now make FDRE a true competitor to conventional thermal sources.Key insights and the way forwardAnalysis of the MoP guidelines and subsequent FDRE tenders reveals two key insights. First, the emphasis on a higher CUF or a 90% demand fulfilment ratio for the month (as evident from the five FDRE tenders released by SECI Ltd) compels RE developers to structure their bids strategically. Thus, the bid design is oriented towards having the installed capacity of RE exceed the capacity committed by the generator. This strategic approach is driven by the economic advantage of RE, with both solar and wind being more cost-effective than storage (given the higher cost associated with ESSs). Consequently, this bidding strategy is anticipated to increase the overall installed capacity of RE within the grid.Second, the MoP guidelines and FDRE tenders shed light on the scheduled commencement of the projects. According to the guidelines, projects below 1000 MW are expected to commence within 24 months, while projects above 1000 MW have a 30-month timeline. This indicates that the storage component in the bid is likely to consist of battery ESS (BESS) projects rather than pumped hydro storage (PHS) projects. Due to their longer gestation periods, PHS\u2014unless close to completion\u2014may not participate in the tendering process. Thus, more FDRE tenders in the future may lead to an increase in BESS projects.To ensure and promote storage-technology-agnostic tenders, the timeline for the scheduled commencement of projects should be revisited. Further, domestic battery manufacturing should be promoted for the widespread availability of batteries in the market and for cost reduction.Going forward, FDRE is essential to steer the energy transition in the emerging era of energy resilience and sustainability. It is also vital for enhancing grid stability and unleashing the complete potential of renewable sources, which will guarantee cleaner and more dependable energy for future generations.[This piece was written exclusively for ETEnergyworld by Dr Ammu Susanna Jacob.

It will be powered by a 2 GW capacity electrolyser, which is 14,000 million units of power annually from 5 GW to 6 GW renewable energy plants, ETEnergyworld claimed quoting unnamed officials.The proposed project, near the Vizhinjam port, aims to make the produced green hydrogen suitable for export. It is planned to be executed in three phases, with the first phase having a capacity of 100 KTPA of green hydrogen derivative, followed by phases 2 and 3 with 500 KTPA capacity each. The estimated timeline for each phase is between 36 to 42 months. The investment amount of INR 26,400 crore excludes the renewable energy captive generation facility. The project is expected to require approximately 50 million liters of water per day and is projected to employ 4,000 to 5,000 skilled and unskilled workers, with 18,000 staff during the construction phase. In November 2022, the company also entered into a framework agreement with Egypt for a green hydrogen plant in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, involving an $8 billion investment. This initiative aligns with India's National Green Hydrogen Mission, which aims to establish a 5 MTPA green hydrogen production capacity by 2030 and encourage the export of green hydrogen and its derivatives. Green hydrogen production, characterized by zero carbon emissions, is considered a preferable method for decarbonizing industries that heavily rely on hydrogen. Presently, 93% of hydrogen consumption occurs in refineries and fertilizers, but by 2030, hydrogen is anticipated to play a significant role in sectors such as steel, mobility, and fuel blending.",

Meena at the Western Coal Fields headquarters here told reporters that Coal India will install integrated solar and pump storage projects in de-coaled land from where coal has been extracted fully. The move is aimed at the optimum utilisation of WCL assets and 4-5 old mines have been identified in the Chhindwara Pench area wherein integrated solar and hydropower plants would be set up to contribute to green energy production, the secretary said. He informed that he along with the WCL chairman and managing director and other officials visited and inspected the old coal mines where mining work has finished.   WCL will survey more such de-coaled assets in the region and after assessment by experts, WCL will try to make optimum use of those assets of WCL which have been de-coaled,  he said. Meena also informed that the Indian government has approved a scheme to promote coal gasification through 'Viability gap funding'. Earlier, the government has also notified two or three incentives for coal gasification. He further said the government will give financial support of Rs 1000 crore or 15 per cent of the project cost or whichever is lower for private sector initiative who want to set up their coal gasification plant.  Similarly, those private entrepreneurs who want to set up small gasification plants with a minimum investment of Rs 100 crores will be allowed viability gap funding of 15 per cent of the project cost,  he said.",

Chairing a meeting of government and industry stakeholders from the transport sector in the national capital, he emphasised the government's commitment to energy transition and India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) commitment to reduce emissions intensity.  The minister said that, if necessary, the government would be ready to allocate additional funds beyond the already earmarked Rs 496 crore for the transport sector under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, according to an official statement.  There should be a concerted series of trials for identifying the potential of green hydrogen in the transport sector so that a national roadmap for the decarbonisation of the sector through use of green hydrogen can be formulated, he said.  The roadmap should include details of pilot projects, technological advancements, and the potential for cost reduction through localized manufacturing and scaling processes, he added.  Pitching for the use of green hydrogen in pilot projects, the minister called for a comprehensive comparison of technology and cost between hydrogen-powered vehicles and battery-electric vehicles.  He also emphasised the need for developing an indigenous technology for integrating hydrogen into the transport sector.  Industry representatives expressed concerns about challenges related to the higher cost of green hydrogen, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage cylinders.  Singh assured the industry that costs will naturally come down, with progress in scaling up and development of indigenous manufacturing.  Officials from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, and representatives from the transport sector, including those from hydrogen dispensing entities, storage and transport agencies, component manufacturers, testing agencies and standard making bodies, attended the meeting.",

These incentives are likely to assist RIL achieve GH2 (green hydrogen) cost of $1-1.5/kg,  Nuvama Research said in a report dated January 20. The cost of GH2 is around $3/kg at present.The country's largest private sector company has secured sops under both rounds of solar modules PLIs - $300 million for 4 gigawatt (GW) in round one and $400 million for 6 GW in round two. The company also won PLI under advanced chemistry cell (ACC) battery storage for 5 GW capacity.  107062374Recently, RIL won incentives of $0.23/kg for green hydrogen (GH2) capacity of 90,000 metric tonnes per year and $0.3/kg for an electrolyser capacity of 300 megawatt. This sums up to an incentive of $0.5/kg, subsidising 13% of current G H2 manufacturing cost, Nuvama said in its report. At the International Climate Summit in 2021, RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani had outlined his company's vision to bring down the cost of hydrogen to less than $1 for one kg in 10 years - the '1-1-1 target' for GH2.Last week, Ambani said the company's 'new energy giga complex' in Jamnagar is all set to be commissioned in the second half of calendar 2024.  I am confident that Reliance's new energy business will play a pivotal role in the global movement for adoption of cleaner fuels,  he said.ET had on August 22 reported that RIL will commission 5 GW of its 20 GW solar modules capacity next year. The company is planning to enter solar manufacturing and generation with a target of 100 GW of solar energy by 2030. For solar, RIL can reach 100 GW of installation by 2030, which is 36% of the total 2030 India solar capacity of 280 GW,  Bernstein Research had said in a report dated December 4. RIL has signed a supply agreement with China-based Suzhou Maxwell Technologies to buy a high-efficiency production line for HJT cells for 5 GW capacity. RIL will commission 5 GW of HJT modules and 5 GWh of LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery capacity by 2QFY25. The company intends to use most of the initial production for captive set up of 20 GW of renewable capacity - enough to meet its annual energy requirement,  Jefferies India had said in a research report dated December 5.RIL has signed a supply agreement with China-based Suzhou Maxwell Technologies to buy a high-efficiency production line for HJT cells for 5 GW capacity.

        "articleBody": "Deep in the desert along the border with Pakistan, billionaire Gautam Adani is building the world's largest renewable energy park as he races to future-proof his coal-linked fortune.Gautam Adani's ports-to-airports, media and energy empire -- which critics say has benefited from his links with Narendra Modi -- made him for a brief time in 2022 the world's second-richest man, with a $154 billion fortune.A year ago his firms were hit by accusations of a  brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme  by US short-seller Hindenburg Research and their market value slumped by more than $150 billion.But they have since recovered much of their losses and the publicity-shy 61-year-old high school dropout is betting hefty sums on making billions more from the energy transition.106982168India is the world's third-biggest carbon emitter and Modi's government has been at the forefront of attempts to push back against the  phase out  of coal at global summits.But the world's most populous country and fastest-growing major economy needs ever more power, and Adani is building what he calls a  monumental  solar and wind project he boasts will be  visible even from space .As the wind whips up sand in the baking heat of the Rann of Kutch desert, thousands of labourers erect vast rows of solar panels, dig foundations for wind turbines and lay seemingly endless rolls of wires.Sagar Adani, Gautam's nephew and executive director of Adani Green Energy, told AFP that the project's teams are working  at an accelerated pace .When complete in 2027, the $2.3-billion Khavda Renewable Energy Park will cover 726 square kilometres (280 square miles) -- nearly the size of New York City.106982202The park is aimed to have the capacity to generate 30 gigawatts of solar and wind energy -- enough to power the homes of 18 million people, more than the combined populations of London and New York. Adani will produce 17GW, with the rest generated by other companies.The project is slated to produce a third more power than China's Three Gorges Dam, currently the world's biggest power-generating facility.'Proud Indian'The scheme is the showpiece of Adani Green Energy -- in which France's TotalEnergies bought a 19.7 percent stake for $2.5 billion three years ago.In Mundra, site of India's largest commercial port -- run by another arm of the Adani empire -- it is manufacturing key components for its aggressive solar and wind energy foray, including colossal wind turbine blades nearly 80 metres long.Solar panels are churned out on high-tech production lines nearby. We are creating one of the globe's most extensive and integrated renewable energy manufacturing ecosystems for solar and wind,  Adani wrote last month on X, formerly Twitter, where he describes himself as a  Proud Indian. Excited to be part of the India growth story! New Delhi has called for ambitious clean energy projects to create 500 gigawatts of renewable capacity to meet half its energy needs by 2030.Adani -- who rejected Hindenburg's charges as  maliciously mischievous  -- has said he will invest an estimated $100 billion into that energy transition.When fully operational, Adani's renewable energy park will make up the equivalent of a quarter of India's current capacity from wind and solar.But India also plans to sharply increase its coal-based power capacity and vows to become carbon neutral only by 2070, two decades later than many countries.'Mirrors India's ambitions'Political opponents have often accused Modi of abetting Adani's rapid rise, allowing the billionaire to unfairly win contracts and avoid proper regulatory oversight.Both men come from Gujarat, and Adani has often praised the PM's policies. Ashok Malik, from the Asia Group consultancy, said the Adani Group is  sitting on very solid assets  and  mirrors India's ambitions and hopes and strategy .Malik said Adani, like all of India's conglomerates and major multinationals in the country, were  broadly aligning  themselves with the government's economic strategy. It makes perfect sense for a company which is solely invested in India's energy sector to start looking at clean and renewable energy to shift from coal -- though coal will not entirely go away,  Malik told AFP.At the energy park, workers in hard hats and neon jackets wrap their faces in cloth for protection from the biting sand and blazing sun. One manager, who was not authorised to speak to the media, said the conditions were  challenging  but the scale of the construction was  awe-inspiring .The site is around 75 kilometres (47 miles) from the nearest village, and about six kilometres from the heavily militarised border with nuclear-armed arch-rival Pakistan.Such grand projects often come at a heavy environmental footprint, but local conservationist Mahendra Bhanani said that while he would like a study on its impacts to be conducted, the energy park is far from human settlements and biodiversity hotspots.  Solar energy is better than many polluting chemical industries,  he said.",

We can learn from them (Brazil) and collaborate with them to ensure that we also develop an ecosystem for ethanol and such alcohol-based fuels,  the Minister of State (MoS) for Road Transport and Highways said at the 'Assocham-Fuels of the Future 2.0' conference in the national capital.He further said that there is a need for awareness on alternative fuels to replace fossil fuels. Beside sugarcane, ethanol can also be produced using broken rice, maize and corn. There is also a push on sustainable aviation fuel and we have conducted a trial of sustainable aviation fuels powered flight. The greatest challenge before us today is what alternative fuel we adopt and how we can bring about a change in mindset towards alternative fuels,  said Singh who is also the minister of state for civil aviation.Kenneth Felix Haczynski da Nobrega, Ambassador, Embassy of the Federative Republic of Brazil, said the launch of Global BioFuel Alliance during India's G20 presidency is indeed a groundbreaking endeavour in clean energy. It heralds the beginning of a new phase, one that will consolidate bio-fuel technology as an important option for decarbonisation of our economies. The Brazilian Presidency of the G20 will push forward the implementation of the GBA,  the ambassador said. Brazil and India have been developing technological dialogue on ethanol for three years...we will further develop this partnership, this technological partnership and try to find new partners so that bio-fuel ethanol can be used in a larger number of countries and become a larger commodity. Brazil is ready to share its technology and its experience with India,  he told PTI.On government's green hydrogen mission, Singh said the mission is doing extremely well in terms of ensuring that green hydrogen becomes a fuel for running various type of vehicles.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Billionaire Gautam Adani on Tuesday said green hydrogen could be a viable alternative to fossil fuels and holds the key to India's journey to net-zero carbon emissions. However, he said that  green hydrogen relies on renewable energy, so the latter's production cost must fall faster than green hydrogen's to be viable .In a blog post for the World Economic Forum (WEF), the head of apples-to-airport Adani Group said leapfrogging to renewables and green hydrogen will help India achieve energy security and improve air quality in cities. While renewables like solar and wind have come a long way, their intermittent nature requires energy storage solutions for when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing. Decarbonization of industry, heavy-duty transportation and chemicals require a green molecule to replace fossil fuels. Green hydrogen, derived from water electrolysis using renewable energy, is the answer to both,  Adani said.Green hydrogen produced by splitting water using renewable electricity is a clean fuel with no carbon emissions. It can be used as a feedstock in industries like steel and oil refineries and as fuel in automobiles and produces water on being burnt. For India, green hydrogen presents a home-grown opportunity as it holds the promise, along with renewables, to lift the yoke of expensive energy imports from its economy \u2013 more than $230 billion per year (19.1 trillion INR) for crude imports,  he addedAdani said that while electric vehicles will contribute to emission reduction in mobility, other solutions like green hydrogen may be needed for heavy-duty transportation.  Green hydrogen and its derivatives \u2013 methanol and ammonia \u2013 have the potential to address these challenges. Green hydrogen may be the last mile in the net-zero journey for many sectors, especially in India. However, for that green hydrogen's cost have to be reduced from current $3-5 per kg, he added.Vertical integration, where a company takes on all upstream and downstream activities associated with its main offering, could significantly reduce green hydrogen production costs, Adani suggested. For India, the equitable solution is not to replace one fossil fuel with another but to leapfrog to renewables and green hydrogen,  he said.  The decrease in solar costs can be replicated in green hydrogen. The cost of electricity generated from solar panels in 2011 was Rs 15 per kilowatt-hour (or per unit), which has now fallen to Rs 1.99 per unit - the lowest in the world.",

        "articleBody": "In a path-breaking innovation, serial entrepreneur Gaurav Tiwari Tony, Head of Hydrogen Division, has introduced Hy-Box Technology, aimed at giving a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s call for National \u201cGreen Hydrogen\u201d Mission to revolutionise the energy landscape. Hy-Box has its corporate headquarters in the national capital.\u201cHy-Box technology is an outcome of extensive research and development pursuits based on reliable scientific analysis and study, which has the potential to accelerate the pace of offering a clean and sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels,\u201d said Gaurav Tiwari Tony, who has not only worked on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects but has also built a Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU)-based LNG terminal. FSRU is a floating vessel that can transport, store, and re-gasify Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) on-board.He revealed that the new Hy-Box Technology is purely a thermal heat technology where a 200-degree hard rock is used to generate steam in a closed loop, which is then directed to propel turbines to generate green power. The technology further uses electrolysers to generate green hydrogen. \u201cWe are in talks with a German company for the supply of required turbines and electrolysers. We will be doing three projects in different locations, starting with 1 MW implementation and each project will be expandable to 5 MW.\u201dGaurav Tiwari Tony revealed that once Hy-Box POC projects are implemented, a patent for thermal \u201cGreen Hydrogen\u201d production will be filed. Gaurav Tiwari Tony, holds three patents in energy and other fields.Gaurav said further, \u201cWe are in talks with companies for offtake and distribution of \u2018green hydrogen\u2019 on a city basis. What\u2019s more, our parent company BoxLNG is implementing three Compressed Biogas (CBG) projects worth 300 crores in 2024. BoxLNG has a previous tie-up with a Norwegian Fund too.\u201d\u201cWe have a very strong team. We have a Padma Shri geologist working as a consultant to ensure successful implementation of the projects,\u201d added Gaurav Tiwari Tony.In reply to a question, Gaurav said that India\u2019s requirement of five million tonnes of hydrogen can be met only through adopting innovative technologies. \u201cIndia is the second-largest importer of LNG in the world after Japan. LNG capacity is approximately 30 million tonnes and up to 3-9% hydrogen needs to be added in Re-gasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG),\u201d added Gaurav Tiwari Tony, who was in the USA for the last 20 years before returning to India to contribute to his motherland\u2019s green energy generation needs.Asked if green hydrogen can be produced with the present power generation systems like solar or any other energy, Gaurav Tiwari Tony, who has three patents already in energy and other sectors, said, \u201cHy-Box Technology\u2019s innovation to generate \u2018green hydrogen\u2019 is best suited as it can be implemented in any part of the country as 200-degree hot rock is everywhere. This is based on a 200-degree hot rock closed loop thermal system and will run 24 hours as base load green power to produce green hydrogen.\u201dGaurav expressed happiness over the fact that the National \u201cGreen Hydrogen\u201d Mission, approved by the Union Cabinet in January 2023, has an outlay of Rs. 19,744 crore, and aims to create a capacity of 5 metric million tonnes per annum (MMTPA) by 2030. Referring to Prime Minister Modi\u2019s model of 2 kg carbon for 1 kg hydrogen, Gaurav said that Hy-Box Technology will obviate any need to produce carbon as it will produce 100% green hydrogen production with zero carbon emissions.It is worth mentioning that by 2030 Reliance Industries plans to create or enable the capacity to generate at least 100 gigawatts of electricity from renewable sources, which can be converted into carbon-free green hydrogen. Reacting to a news report based on Reliance Industries' statement that the company can produce green hydrogen at $1 per kg, Gaurav said that $2 per kg for the long-term and $3 per kg till the project cost looks more feasible.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India\u2019s G20 Sherpa and former NITI Aayog chief executive Amitabh Kant emphasized the country's strategic shift towards a circular economy, citing its potential to foster environmental conservation, economic growth, and job creation. Speaking at the \u2018FICCI Circular Economy Symposium\u2019, Kant set forth an ambitious target for India to reduce the cost of green hydrogen production to $1 per kg by 2030, down from the current rate of $4.5 per kg.Kant underscored the urgency for India to accelerate its growth rate from the current 7.5 percent to between 9 and 10 percent per annum in the coming years, with a particular focus on renewable energy and green hydrogen. \u201cIndia is climatically blessed to produce green hydrogen,  he stated, highlighting the country's unique position in the global push for renewable energy.In his address, Kant stressed the importance of transitioning to a circular economy - an economic system that emphasizes recycling and reusing inputs to minimize environmental emissions and facilitate sustainable production. \u201cWe need to achieve the circularity of inputs. India is currently not circular, and the economic model is linear. There is a radical need to transit to a circular economy as it opens a huge possibility of innovation, disruption, and help reduce greenhouse emissions,\u201d he added.The transition to a circular economy, according to Kant, is crucial for India to become a global leader in sustainable development. This includes investing in infrastructure and fostering innovation to accelerate the transition process.Contributing to the symposium, Michael Bucki, Counsellor, Head of Section \u2013 Delegation of the European Union to India, acknowledged the significant opportunities for mutual learning and collaboration between India and the EU in the circular economy domain.Janardhanan Ramanujalu, Vice President, Regional Head- South Asia & Australia, SABIC, pointed out the challenges posed by rapid urbanization, deforestation, and population growth, leading to carbon dioxide imbalance. He advocated for a focus on the circular carbon economy, including steps like carbon capture and utilization, recycling of carbon-based products, and innovation in materials.",

        "articleBody": "Biogas is the most viable fuel for small cars in India given the abundant availability of the bio waste in the country, RC Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India, said. According to him, battery-powered vehicles at present have many limitations for users of small cars, including price and charging facilities, and are more suitable for those with higher income levels. His comments come against the backdrop of Suzuki Motor Corp committing investment in biogas. Biogas is the best fuel as it is renewable and has zero emission. It's the best solution for small cars in India. Depending on the way various technologies develop, particularly the way the battery prices come down, the situation may change in the future,  Bhargava told ET on the sidelines of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit.Unlike homegrown manufacturers such as Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, which are largely banking on electric vehicles to achieve carbon neutrality, the local arm of the Japanese car maker is looking at multiple technologies including hybrids, EVs and bio-CNG to achieve the goal. It would launch its first EV in FY25 as part of a plan to have a portfolio of half a dozen EVs at various price points by 2030. As of now, Tata Motors Tiago.ev and MG Motor India's Comet are the only EVs that have their prices starting from below \u20b910 lakh. Even Maruti's first pure electric offering will have a premium price positioning.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Green Hydrogen and Green Chemicals, ACME Cleantech Solutions, and Greenko Zero are among the nine firms that have emerged as successful bidders for government's incentives for setting up facilities to produce up to 4.50 lakh tonnes of green hydrogen. On July 10, state-owned Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) had invited bids for selection of green hydrogen producers for setting up production facilities of 4,50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Scheme (Mode-1-Tranche-I).  As many as 12 companies' bids were qualified for incentives to set up production facilities of 5,49,500 tonnes of green hydrogen, against the offered capacity of 4,50,000 tonnes.  A SECI statement issued on January 9 showed Reliance Green Hydrogen and Green Chemicals Ltd has been selected to receive incentives for production of 90,000 tonnes of green hydrogen at a three-year average rate of Rs 18.9 per kg.  Similarly, ACME Cleantech Solutions Private Ltd and Greenko ZeroC Private Ltd have bagged incentives for production of 90,000 tonnes each at a three-year average rate of Rs 30 per kg.  Torrent Power has won the sops for 18,000 tonnes of capacity at an average rate of Rs 28.89 per kg, while HHP Two Private Ltd has won incentives for producing 75,000 tonnes at an average rate of Rs 25.04 per kg and Welspun New Energy bagged the benefit for producing 20,000 tonnes at the rate of Rs 20 per kg of green hydrogen.  Besides, CESC Projects Ltd will get incentives for 0,500 tonnes of output and UPL Ltd for 10,000 tonnes of capacities.  JSW Neo Energy Ltd has been selected to get government sops for the production of 6,500 tonnes at an average rate of Rs 34.66 per kg of the green energy.  In total, these nine firms have bagged incentives to set up 4,10,000 tonnes of green hydrogen production facilities under Bucket-1 (Technology Agnostic Pathways).  Under this bucket, Sembcorp Green Hydrogen India Private Ltd, Avaada GreenH2 Private Ltd and GH4INDIA Private Ltd have not been allocated any incentives.  Sembcorp Green Hydrogen India had quoted the a three-year average incentive of Rs 36 per kg, while Avaada GreenH2 and GH4INDIA Private Ltd had quoted Rs 39 per kg and Rs 40 per kg, respectively.  Also, state-owned refiner Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd has been selected for receiving incentives at an average rate of Rs 30 per kg to set up 2,000 tonnes of production facility under Bucket-2 (Biomass Based Pathways).  In January last year, the Union Cabinet had approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore with an aim to make India a global hub for manufacturing this clean source of energy.  The mission is expected to lead to the development of 5 million metric tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030.  The mission aims to develop India as a global hub for production, usage and exports of green hydrogen and its derivatives. It is expected to promote multilateral engagements and collaborations with various international efforts in hydrogen and fuel cells.  The mission provides for setting up of two green hydrogen hubs in the initial phase.  The ministry of ports, shipping and waterways has identified three major ports -- Deendayal, Paradip and V O Chidambaranar (Tuticorin) Ports -- to be developed as hydrogen hubs.",

        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI - India's trade department has backed lowering taxes on hybrid vehicles to help the transition to cleaner energy sources, following demands by Japanese car makers, five government and industry sources told Reuters. The move could irk some local carmakers.  India's combined sales and additional taxes on hybrid vehicles sales are as high as 43%, based on the size of the car, compared with the highest rate of 50% imposed on petrol and diesel cars. India taxes electric vehicles (EVs) at just 5%.  Hybrid vehicles are less polluting than diesel vehicles and there is merit in taxes on hybrid vehicles being somewhere between what's levied on diesel vehicles and electric vehicles,  one of the government sources, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. The move could boost the prospects in India of Japan's Toyota Motor, the world's largest carmaker, which has been lobbying for months for lower taxes for hybrid cars, arguing such vehicles are far less polluting than petrol cars. According to two government sources, India's trade promotion and industry ministry has asked the heavy industries ministry to  rationalise cess  on hybrid cars, two government sources said. Cess is an additional tax typically levied on the sale of products identified as  luxury goods  by New Delhi. Cess on hybrid cars goes up to 15% based on the size of the vehicle. The move would eventually need a nod from the ministry of finance. In a letter written last month to Indian heavy industry secretary Kamran Rizvi, the country's trade promotion and industry secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh cited representation by a  foreign  carmaker that hybrids attract higher levies than electric vehicles. The letter stated that India needed hybrids and EVs to meet its climate goals and stakeholders should work in sync to meet the targets, a government and an industry official said. The move would, however, be a shift from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government's stance of heavily incentivising EVs. India aims to shift 30% of its fleet by 2030 to electric vehicles.  Such policy flip-flops will delay the transition to EVs and hurt investment sentiments,  the industry official said. The Indian electric cars market is dominated by local players Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. India's industry and heavy industry ministries did not respond to emails sent by Reuters requesting comment. None of the officials quoted wanted to be identified since the proposal has not been announced. Japanese car markers including Honda Motor and Suzuki Motor's India partner Maruti Suzuki, which has the largest market share, have publicly sought government support for hybrids.",

        "articleBody": "Green hydrogen in India can not only provide energy for sectors such as fertilizers, chemicals, refining and iron, but also save carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels, the World Economic Forum said on Wednesday. In a detailed analysis of what it will take to make green hydrogen a credible energy pathway in India, the report said,  Green hydrogen can enable energy transition as India takes its net-zero journey towards 2070 while supporting its growing energy needs. The report by the World Economic Forum, written in collaboration with Bain & Co, recommended five areas that can benefit from public-private interventions in expediting the adoption of green hydrogen in India.Hydrogen produced through the electrolysis of water and powered by renewable energy, which is known as green hydrogen, is considered a clean, flexible and versatile energy carrier that can also help address the tension between energy supply and climate change, the report said.India is currently the third-largest economy in the world in terms of energy needs, and the country's demand for energy is set to surge. The demand is estimated to grow 35 per cent by 2030.In 2022, India's energy import bill was pegged at USD 185 billion, a figure that is sure to rise if the country continues to supply its growing energy demand through traditional methods.At the same time, India set a commitment to achieve net zero by 2070 at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), held in 2021.At the Glasgow summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said,  Today, the whole world believes that India is the only big economy which has delivered both in letter and spirit on the Paris commitment. We are making every effort with determination. The WEF report said green hydrogen is critical to help meet India's energy security needs while reducing emissions in hard-to-abate sectors on the path to net zero.The government had launched the National Green Hydrogen Mission in early 2022 with an aim to spur green hydrogen production and consumption through incentive funding of roughly USD 2.3 billion to be distributed between 2022 and 2030.Currently, India produces 6.5 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) of hydrogen, predominantly for use in crude oil refineries and fertiliser production.Most of the country's current hydrogen supply is grey hydrogen, which is produced using fossil fuels in a process that creates CO2 gas emissions.The National Green Hydrogen Mission has set a target for the production of 5 MMTPA of green hydrogen by 2030 - equivalent to roughly half of India's projected overall hydrogen demand of 11 MMTPA at that time.Green hydrogen production requires an ample supply of renewable energy for the electrolysis process.According to the report, India's renewable energy potential can support its goals for green hydrogen growth but needs rapid capacity addition.Also, there is limited on-the-ground traction for green hydrogen in the country, and key players have indicated that most are in a  wait-and-watch  phase.Many expect sizeable production of green hydrogen to take effect beginning in 2027 and after, according to the report.",

        "articleBody": "EverEnviro, a wholly owned subsidiary of Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF), is in the process of hiring investment banks and discussions are ongoing with firms such as Standard Chartered and Avendus. Once materialised, this would be the first private equity investment in the fast-growing CBG sector. EverEnviro Resource Management, set up by Eversource Capital in 2019, offers comprehensive solutions for the management of various waste streams, including urban municipal waste, agro waste and hazardous waste. Eversource Capital is an equal joint venture between Everstone Group and Lightsource bp.At present, EverEnviro has an operational Bio-CNG plant in Indore with 550 tonnes per day capacity and supply CBG into Avantika Gas\u2019 piped natural gas (PNG) grid since September last year. It plans to add 5 more plants operational by FY24 - in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh with a total capacity of 60 MT CBG per day.When contacted, Mahesh Girdhar, MD and CEO, EverEviro Resource Management, declined to comment on the fundraising plans.  We have backing from the leading banking institutions such as PNB, Tata Capital and HDFC and we are in the process of further expansion. As the first player in the industry to have 5 CBG plants operational, we are setting a value proposition for the industry,  he said.States like Punjab, Haryana face a lot of smoke issues during September -October time, due to the burning of the residue. So, we want to be part of the solution and we plan to set up multiple more plants based on the rice residue. Same way in UP, we have plants based on the sugarcane press mud, Girdhar said. EverEnviro plans to attain a daily CBG output of 1,000 tonnes on a pan- India scale within the next 4-5 years, with spending Rs70-100 crore per plant, he added. However, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) provides just Rs 4 crore for plants producing 4.8 ton per day of CBG, capped to Rs 10 crore per plant for 12 ton per day or more per CBG plant. As per the latest data, about 48 CBG plants were commissioned till date, with CBG quantity of 9548 tonnes sold in FY 2023-24.In order to promote the production and consumption of CBG in the country, the National Biofuels Coordination Committee (NBCC) had introduced phase wise mandatory blending of CBG in CNG (Transport) & PNG (Domestic) segments of the City Gas Distribution (CGD) sector. CBG Blending Obligation (CBO) shall be kept as 1%, 3% and 4% of total CNG/PNG consumption for FY 2025-26, 2026-27 and 2027-28 respectively. From 2028-29 onward, CBO will be 5%, according to Rameswar Teli, the petroleum & natural gas minister. In September, EverEnviro had entered into a JV with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) to set up Compressed Biogas Plants (CBG) in the country, as part of EverEnviro's mission to establish over 100 CBG plants across India based on diverse feedstock, including municipal solid waste (MSW), agro waste, and agro-industrial waste. Another Bengaluru based CBG player Trualt Bioenergy had tied up with Gail India to establish 10 compressed biogas (CBG) plants, with an investment exceeding $72 million. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries plans to set up about 100 CBG plants across the country over the next five years, consuming more than 5.5 million tons of agricultural residue and organic waste, leading to about 2 million tons reduction in carbon emissions annually.",

During the brief test aboard POEM, 180 W of power was generated from hydrogen and oxygen gases stored in high-pressure vessels, offering valuable insights into the performance of various static and dynamic systems within the power system, as well as the underlying physics, according to ISRO.Hydrogen Fuel Cells produce electricity directly from Hydrogen and Oxygen gases, along with pure water and heat. It is an electric generator which works on electrochemical principles, as in batteries, as against the combustion reactions employed in conventional generators. The ability to produce electricity directly from fuels without any intermediate step renders them very efficient. With water as the only byproduct, they are totally emission free. These features make them ideal candidates for space missions involving humans where electric power, water and heat are essential since a single systems can meet multiple requirements in the mission.ISRO also said that the fuel cells have  significant societal application potential .  They are also considered to be the most appropriate solution to replace the engines of various types vehicles in use today and to power standby power systems. Fuel Cells can provide range and fuel recharge time equaling that of today\u2019s conventional engine, which gives them a distinct advantage over batteries, and are expected to facilitate emission free transportation,  it added. Fuel cell is an ideal power source for the space station as it provides both power and pure water, ISRO added.",

India is promoting the use of maize as an alternative to sugar to boost ethanol production and ensure sufficient supply of the sweetener in the market. In December, India directed sugar mills not to use cane juice to produce ethanol as the country's sugar production is expected to decline in the 2023/24 marketing year that began in October. Last week, state fuel retailers raised the procurement price for ethanol made from C-heavy molasses, a cane by-product that has hardly any sugar content in it, by 8.87 Indian rupees per litre. Ethanol makes up about 10.2% of petrol sold in India and the government aims to raise blending to 20% by 2025. The Indian Sugar Mills Association, a producers' body, said last month that India's sugar production is likely to fall to 32.5 million metric tons in the 2023/24 marketing year, down from its previous estimate of 33.7 million tons. In the preceding marketing year, India is estimated to have produced 36.6 million tonnes of sugar.",

        "articleBody": "Blending of ethanol into petrol has resulted in savings of over Rs 24,300 crore of foreign exchange in the supply year 2022-23, said Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Puri on Wednesday.Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) have saved about 509 crore litres of petrol on account of ethanol blending during the ethanol supply year 2022-23, besides leading to an expeditious payment of about Rs 19,300 crore to farmers.It is estimated that a net reduction of net carbon dioxide to the tune of 108 lakh metric tonnes was seen during the period.Notably, as recently as last week, oil marketing companies in the public sector announced an incentive of Rs 6.87 per litre for the production of ethanol from C-heavy molasses.The oil companies believe this incentive would maximise ethanol production from the C molasses route and improve the overall availability of ethanol for the ethanol blended petrol programme. C-molasses is a by-product of sugar factories and its use for ethanol production is an effective way to promote a green economy.India has already rolled out 20 per cent blended fuel, though in a phased manner, in April 2023 and widespread availability is expected in days to come.The government is ambitious of attaining 20 per cent ethanol-blended petrol by 2024-25 and 30 per cent by 2029-30. The government has advanced the target of E20 fuel from 2030 to 2025.E20 blending in petrol was introduced by the Centre to reduce the country's oil import cost, energy security, lower carbon emissions and better air quality.The number of retail outlets retailing E20 fuel is now more than 9,300 and will cover the entire country by 2025, Puri said today.The Food Ministry in early December directed sugar mills not to use cane juice or syrup to produce ethanol.In a U-turn, the central government in mid-December allowed the utilisation of juice as well as B-heavy molasses to produce ethanol but capped the diversion of sugar at 17 lakh tonnes for the current marketing season.Notably, at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to an ambitious five-part  Panchamrit  pledge, including reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion metric tonnes by 2030.India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070.The minister also noted that the growth-energy correlation is evident in India as it is now the world's 3rd largest energy consumer, 3rd largest consumer of oil, 3rd Largest LPG consumer, 4th largest LNG importer, 4thlargest refiner and 4th largest automobile market in the world.Underscoring that India has taken a global leadership role in the Biofuels supply chain with the launch of the Global Biofuels Alliance in September 2023, the minister said that India has been successful in promoting GBA as a pivotal path in the sustainability journey at COP 28 held in December 2023.During the conference, Hardeep Singh also mentioned about government's steps to increase share of Natural gas from the present 6.3 percent to 15 percebt in the primary energy mix, saying there will be an investment of $67 Billion in Natural Gas infrastructure in the next 5-6 years. This will translate into increase in the gas consumption by over three-fold, from the present level of around 155 MMSCMD (Million Metric Standard Cubic Meters per Day)to over 500 MMSCMD by the year 2030,  the minister noted.

These partnerships will be for both, manufacturing in India as well as abroad.\u201cWe are, therefore, in advanced stages for partnering with technology providers for green hydrogen electrolyser manufacturing,\u201d he said.The firm launched a 100-megawatt (MW) electrolyser manufacturing plant a few months back, which it now plans to raise to one gigawatt capacity, added Ogra. The company is also in touch with maritime shipping lines to supply them with green methanol on ports. \u201cWe are always wanting to target 8-10 per cent of the overall mix of the total production of green molecules which is in the form of methanol, ethanol,\u201d he said.It is executing a 10-tonnes-per-day green methanol production plant with NTPC where it is capturing carbon dioxide from flue-gases of thermal power plants, making hydrogen through electrolysis, mixing it with reactor and producing green methanol. The plant will get commissioned by the last quarter this year, he added. Methanol is considered a cleaner alternative fuel, which can be used for various purposes, including power generation and transportation.The company has set a target of 0.5 mmtpa capacity of green hydrogen and its derivatives production by 2030 and is participating in bids. \u201cWe are right now participating in a bid for a port land allocation at one of the green hydrogen hubs in India,\u201d he said. He added that the current scale of investments are not capital-intensive, since they are primarily pivoted around very early stage development processes such as environmental impact assessment, identification, getting into soft lease arrangements with the respective stakeholders, securing the load connectivity, preparing the DPR for the project.\u201cThese early-stage developments are critical and would attract a healthy pool of partners. For us right now the outgo is very meager in terms of the capital. We have been talking to a host of players to partner with us on both the equity as well as the debt side of it. So, our outgo would be the developmental costs which are very minimalistic,\u201d said Ogra.Apart from the company\u2019s recent MoU with the Rajasthan government to set up a green hydrogen and green ammonia project in phases, they are also looking at states such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Orissa for export oriented scale up, he added.",

This has come along with a marked shift away from diesel to more environment-friendly options like CNG, electric and strong hybrid vehicles.The share of diesel in new car sales in the NCR declined to 5.8% this fiscal year from 7.5% in FY23 and 8.8% in FY22. CNG, once used mostly in buses and taxis, now accounts for 20.7% of new vehicle sales. Demand for hybrid vehicles too is on the rise, pacing ahead of the electric segment where worries over availability of public charging infrastructure are weighing on sales.Arnab Kumar (name changed), an employee at a public sector bank in Delhi, is looking to sell his diesel-powered Mahindra XUV 700. While his vehicle meets the latest BS-VI emission standards, he is worried about the increasing restrictions on diesel vehicles in the national capital. I am planning to change the car soon,\u201d Kumar said. He is considering replacing it with either a strong hybrid vehicle or an entry-level petrol car from Audi or BMW.In addition to the restrictions on the movement of old diesel vehicles at times of severe pollution, they can be run only for 10 years in the NCR, which has been prompting many like Kumar to move away from the fuel.Strong hybrids come with a combustion engine and electric motor and can run on either of these or a combination of both, offering high fuel efficiency.\u201cWe are seeing higher replacement buying in the NCR, when compared to the national average,\u201d said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer (marketing and sales) at car market leader Maruti Suzuki. \u201cConsumers want new vehicles, clean vehicles. And it is not only in Delhi, the sentiment is spreading to other parts of the country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is an increasing awareness among car buyers that pollution-related actions taken by authorities are only going to get more stringent making them look at more sustainable options.\u201dOn a national level, while the share of diesel vehicles in overall sales of passenger vehicles dropped to 17.5% this fiscal year, from about 19% two years back in FY22, that of CNG increased to 14.5% (from 8.6%). Strong hybrid and electric vehicles comprise 2% of sales currently.Shailesh Chandra, managing director at Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, said cities like Delhi-NCR, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai have emerged as front-runners in this transition to e-mobility. Tata Motor is the market leader in electric cars in India.Customer awareness and acceptability of electric vehicles have improved dramatically over the last couple of years \u2014 about 50,000 electric cars were sold last fiscal year versus 1,200 units in FY20.Chandra said once adequate charging infrastructure is available, the pace of adoption of electric vehicles will accelerate. \u201cNow product is not a problem, and price is also not a big problem because products have proven themselves to be much punchier. Running costs, maintenance costs are low. So, what is stopping people (from purchasing EVs)? Primarily, there are bottlenecks around charging. (That) is what holds a person back to not go for their only and first car as an EV,\u201d Chandra said.Uday Chawla, managing partner at Transearch India and a resident of an upscale residential complex in Gurgaon, said he was debating between purchasing an electric vehicle and a hybrid, anticipating restrictions on vehicle movements to get further stringent. He eventually zeroed in on the Toyota Innova Hycross, a strong hybrid that allayed concerns related to range anxiety. \u201cI deliberately went in for a hybrid vehicle this time. There was a long wait. I had booked it more than six months back,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cEvery year, and at least twice a year we are hit by severe pollution and many of my cars cannot be used due to restrictions on BS-IV diesel and BS-III petrol vehicles \u2026So I decided on a hybrid.\u201dAs per the Graded Response Action Plan \u2014 a set of emergency measures undertaken to prevent deterioration in NCR\u2019s air quality \u2014 movements of BS-IV diesel and BS-III petrol vehicles are restricted once the air quality index reaches the \u2018severe category'.",

        "articleBody": "State-owned SJVN Ltd has secured Rs 10,000 crore construction finance facility to fund its upcoming renewable energy projects from a group of leading domestic and international lenders. The construction finance facility is a unique and first-of-its-kind transaction undertaken by a PSU entity and Public Sector Banks, a company statement said on Friday. According to the statement, SJVN has secured Rs 10,000 crore (USD 1.2 billion) construction finance facility to fund its upcoming renewable power projects from a group of leading domestic and international lenders. SJVN Green Energy Limited (SGEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SJVN Ltd, undertook this initiative in association with SBI Capital Markets Ltd (SBI CAPS). SBI CAPS acted as the sole advisor and arranger for the transaction on behalf of SGEL. Construction finance attracted a tremendous response from lenders and was over-subscribed. After detailed discussions and deliberations, proposals from five banks -- Deutsche Bank, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India and MUFG Bank -- were accepted. This credit facility is of a revolving nature that allows SJVN to draw down funds on an ongoing basis as per the construction requirements of its projects. This facility will help SJVN to fast-track the development of its under-construction RE projects. The facility will enable SJVN to contribute towards the government's target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. The construction financing facility will be deployed strategically to develop state-of-the-art solar and wind energy projects across India, the statement said. The details of this first-of-its-kind transaction undertaken by a PSU entity and public sector banks have been declared in an event organised by SBICAPS. Currently, SJVN's renewable energy portfolio stands at 5,090.5 MW, out of which 179.5 MW is under operation, 1,860 MW is under construction, and 3,051 MW is under various stages of implementation. The company is marching forward with vigour to achieve its mission of 12,000 MW by 2026 and shared vision of 25,000 MW by 2030 and 50,000 MW installed capacity by 2040.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Various government-owned entities including NTPC and GAIL are taking a number of steps to aid the ambitious National Green Hydrogen Mission by setting up projects, Parliament was informed on Thursday. In January, the Centre approved the mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore.  The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is implementing the mission which aims to make India the global hub for production, usage and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives, Union Minister R K Singh told the Lok Sabha in response to a question.  On the present status of adoption of green hydrogen in the country, the minister for new and renewable energy said, GAIL Ltd has started India's maiden project of blending hydrogen in city gas distribution grid.  He said two per cent by volume of hydrogen is being blended in CNG network and 5 per cent volume of hydrogen is being blended into PNG network at city gas station of Avantika Gas Limited (AGL) at Indore in Madhya Pradesh.  Oil India Limited has developed a 60-kW capacity hydrogen fuel cell bus.  NTPC Limited has initiated blending of green hydrogen up to 8 per cent (vol/vol) in PNG Network at NTPC Kawas Township, Surat, Gujarat from January 2023.  In addition, several entities have announced plans to set up production facilities for green hydrogen/green ammonia in India.  Since green hydrogen adoption in the country is at an initial stage, through demonstration projects, its impact on job creation, reduction in dependence on oil and exports has been limited so far.  However, the mission aims to reach 5 million metric tonne per annum ((MMTPA) of green hydrogen capacity, contributing to reduction in dependence on import of fossil fuels.  Achievement of mission targets is expected to reduce a cumulative Rs 1 lakh crore worth of fossil fuel imports by 2030. This is likely to leverage over Rs 8 lakh crore in total investments and create over 6 lakh jobs.  Under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) scheme (Mode - I, tranche - I) of the National Green Hydrogen Mission, Singh said, requests for proposals have been invited for selection of green hydrogen producers to set up production facilities of 4,50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen in the country.",

Gautam Adani, billionaire and chairman of Adani Group, during an event at the Port of Haifa in Haifa, Israel, on Jan. 31, 2023.An Adani Group representative didn\u2019t offer an immediate comment on the founders\u2019 investment.The company board will consider fundraising proposals on Dec. 26, including evaluating options such as selling shares or convertible securities, it said in a filing Wednesday without sharing any more details. \u201cAn equity raise could boost deleveraging and lower refinancing risk, though governance concerns may linger,\u201d Sharon Chen, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a Dec. 15 note. The company, which has a goal of 45 gigawatts of green energy capacity by 2030, also has bond maturities worth $1.2 billion coming up next year and it has already begun outlining plans for repaying or refinancing those. It also raised a loan from eight banks earlier this month.All these efforts underscore Adani Group\u2019s attempts to draw a line over damaging allegations of corporate fraud levied by Hindenburg Research in January that plunged the ports-to-power conglomerate into crisis for months. Clawback ModeDespite strongly denying these allegations, Adani companies lost over $150 billion in market value at one point. The conglomerate has since then been in clawback mode \u2014 it has lowered debt, got marque investors and secured US funding for its Sri Lanka port project \u2014 winning back investor and lender confidence. The group\u2019s stocks saw a relief rally in its shares last month after India\u2019s top court said it won\u2019t take media reports on the conglomerate as the \u201cgospel truth\u201d while reserving verdict on its probe into Hindenburg\u2019s allegations.

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries is building a green energy business to supply the equipment India will need for its green energy revolution, according to analysts. For solar, RIL can reach 100GW of installation by 2030, which is 36% of the total 2030 India solar capacity of 280GW. For batteries, it could also achieve a similar market share of 36% with a battery capacity of 50GWh versus expected battery capacity of 139GWh in 2030. For hydrogen, RIL can capture about 19% of the market with 16GW of cumulative electrolyzer capacity by 2030,  said Bernstein Research in a report dated 4 December.At at 44th AGM in June 2021, RIL announced its plan to spend Rs 75000 crore over the next three years in a  New Energy  business. As part of this, RIL is spending Rs 60,000 crore to construct four  giga factories  to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolyzers, fuel cells, and batteries to store energy from the grid. These plants will be located at the new 5,000-acre Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar. An additional 15000 crore will be used for investments across the value chain, technology, and partnerships for the New Energy business.ET had on 22 August reported that RIL will commission 5GW of its 20GW solar modules capacity next year. Reliance is planning to enter solar manufacturing and generation with a target of 100GW of solar energy by 2030. RIL will commission 5GW of HJT modules and 5 GWh of LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery capacity by 2QFY25. The company intends to use most initial production for captive set up of 20GW of renewable capacity- enough to meet its annual energy requirement,  said Jefferies India in a research report dated 5 December.RIL will begin production at its solar PV (photovoltaic) and module factory, based on REC technology in Jamnagar. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar, RIL acquired a 100% stake in Norway-headquartered REC Solar in 2021 for $771 million (\u20b95800 crore).REC provides the high-efficiency solar panels with Heterojunction Technology (HJT). RIL targets to increase the HJT module efficiency to 26% by 2026 from the current 23% and further improve it to 28% through innovations like perovskite-tandem cell technology, the company said in its annual report for 2022-23, adding that it also aims to extend the life of PV modules from 25 to 50 years.RIL has signed a supply agreement with China-based Suzhou Maxwell Technologies to buy a high-efficiency production line for HJT cells for 5 GW capacity.Bernstein added that RIL will have integrated manufacturing starting from raw silica and polysilicon to ingot, wafers, to finished cells and modules.  For batteries, Reliance is looking to build large-scale grid batteries and will collaborate with global leaders on the technology. The first plant will start up in 2023-24 and scale up to 50GWh by 2027. On hydrogen, Reliance will build and install electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, which can be used for transport andstationary power applications through its self-produced fuel cells.RIL could potentially achieve $10bn of revenue from the New Energy business in 2030, which represents 40% of the total addressable market or TAM. By 2030, we estimate RIL could capture 60%, 30%, and 20% of solar, battery, and hydrogen TAM, respectively. RIL plans to have 100GW of installed solar capacity by 2030, which is 35% of India's targeted capacity of 280GW,  said Bernstein Research, adding that the biggest risk for investors is that Reliance has limited expertise in the technology required for batteries, fuel cells, solar PV, or electrolyzers. This will have to be acquired through investments or partnerships with key technology leaders. It also has no experience in mass manufacturing of New Energy equipment.RIL's scrip was trading at Rs 2524.05. up 1.16% on the BSE, Monday afternoon.",

A committee is being set up that will have representation from all stakeholders, including industry, and based on the recommendations, a lending framework for the sector will be worked out that will help bring more funding to the sector,  an official said. The committee will work under the aegis of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the person said.A common framework will also help in consortium lending where foreign lenders including multilateral institutions can participate as various parameters such as project appraisal and post-disbursement supervision will be clearly defined, helping in faster loan sanctions, a bank executive said. The European Investment Bank is already exploring a partnership with state-run Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (Ireda), a non-banking finance company (NBFC), for financing green hydrogen projects.A preliminary meeting on the issue of a lending framework was held in November, another official said.  These three banks have been nominated and will soon give their recommendations,  he said. Issues regarding financing for the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) will also be looked at by this new committee, the official said. Launched in January 2023, NGHM has a total outlay of \u20b919,744 crore. A senior executive with SBI confirmed the development but did not elaborate. An email sent to ICICI and HDFC Bank did not elicit any response as of press time Sunday. The finance ministry has already made a recommendation to the banking sector regulator, the Reserve Bank of India, to include green hydrogen in the priority sector lending (PSL) framework.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries Ltd has joined hands with DBS Bank India to launch a financing program for compressed biogas (CBG) plants.The financing will enable the ecosystem development for vendor partners to aggregate agri-residue as inputs for the Reliance Compressed Biogas (CBG) production plants across India, the company said, adding that the funding structure will ensure that the logistics are designed in a way that this new stream remains competitive and achieves enhanced commercial scale.India produces a significant amount of agricultural residue which is usually burnt in the absence of required processing infrastructure and logistical support. The agricultural residue supply chain has so far been unorganized as farmers and aggregators have not been adequately incentivized and financed. Reliance Industries, identifying this as an important element in their net zero road map, has plans to invest across the country to produce CBG as an alternative to imported CNG and other fossil fuels making India a prominent source of bio-fuel,  the company said, adding that though the technology for CBG has evolved, commercialization requires new infrastructure and value chain engagement involving farmers across the states.RIL has planned to set up around 100 CBG plants over the next 5 years which would consume more than 5.5 million tonnes per annum of agricultural residue and organic waste and lead to a projected reduction of nearly 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The CBG industry is highly fragmented in nature and predominantly dependent on agriculture and is affected by seasonal variations. These modalities required DBS Bank India to introduce significant customizations to the standard supply chain financing model to meet the requirements of the project,  the company said.Rajat Verma, Managing Director and Head of Institutional Banking, at DBS Bank India, said,  \u201cIndia's green energy sector, which includes solar and wind, as well as emerging areaslike biogas, will be one of the key pillars of the country\u2019s net-zero strategy. Transition financing plays a crucial role in enabling businesses to identify and scale new technologies that can accelerate the path to decarbonization. Harindra K Tripathi, Head of Bio-energy Business, Reliance Industries Limited said, \u201cCompressed Biogas plants are one of the key ways to utilize the massive organic waste that our society produces, the burning of which is one of the major contributors to air pollution. In addition to the mitigating effect on carbon emissions, the Reliance CBG plants will also contribute towards the production of Fermented Organic Manure (FOM) which will enhance soil fertility and reduce consumption of chemical fertilizers over a period.\u201dRIL is setting up biogas facilities at multiple locations at Uttar Pradesh by using surplus agro residue and organic waste. These facilities will be linked to a network of biogas dispensing stations operated by Reliance Jio BP.A flagship CBG production facility has been set up in Barabanki, a city with historical significance in Uttar Pradesh. The Barabanki plant alone is expected to cut down CO2 emissions by 40,000 tonnes annually, an effect comparable to the carbon absorption of a 15,000-acre rainforest, highlighting Reliance's commitment to spearheading India's bioenergy transformation.DBS Bank is renowned for its expertise in supply chain financing and goes beyond traditional banking to enable responsible solutions for large enterprises, their supplier networks as wellas small and medium businesses that empower them to streamline operations for enhanced efficiency. The bank's extensive Asian network and deep expertise in customising sustainable solutions enable businesses to mitigate risks and seize growth opportunities.",

        "articleBody": "Keppel Corporation\u2019s infrastructure division and AM Green, which is wholly owned by the founders of Hyderabad-based Greenko, have decided to jointly explore opportunities in producing biogenic carbon-based sustainable fuels in South-east Asia and the Middle East.These sustainable fuels can serve as an environmentally sustainable alternative to fossil fuels to support the decarbonisation of heavy industrial operations and the aviation sector. The companies estimate that these two regions can harness and aggregate at least a million tonnes of biogenic carbon dioxide per year. The companies signed an MoU against the backdrop of COP 28 in Dubai.In addition, Keppel and Greenko will also identify areas for collaboration in the value chain of a bio-methanol project in India. The project aims to produce 500,000 tonnes of bio-methanol annually.Biofuels, which are derived from organic material such as plant and animal biomass, make up the largest source of renewable energy in use globally, accounting for 55% of renewable energy and over 6% of the world\u2019s energy supply. The production and combustion of sustainable fuels significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making them effective cleaner sources of energy.Keppel currently operates a 273,750 tonne per year anaerobic digestion and composting plant in Qatar which was designed and built by Keppel in 2012. This is the world\u2019s largest composting plant, and has the capacity to generate close to 110,000m3 of biogas daily, which is converted into green electricity for operational use, as well as export to the grid. Keppel is also involved in industrial carbon-capture feasibility studies for waste-to-energy facilities in Singapore and the United Kingdom. Cindy Lim, CEO of Keppel\u2019s Infrastructure Division, said, \u201cBiofuels have an important role to play in decarbonising industrial operations and the aviation sector. Keppel\u2019s experience in handling and treating domestic waste and organic feedstock, as well as our know-how in effective carbon cycling will benefit this collaboration with AM Green. This partnership aims to spur the development of next-generation biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel in the region, which can serve as substitutes for fossil fuels.\u201dThe abovementioned collaboration is not expected to have any material impact on the earnings per share and net tangible asset per share of Keppel Corporation for the Company\u2019s current financial year, the company said.\u201cThis partnership will propel the transformation of India towards being an exporter of renewable-energy derived products such as green methanol and SAF. AM Green will utitlise Greenko\u2019s Intelligent Renewable Energy Storage Platform (IRESP) to combat climate change, and establish us as a reliable, sustainable source of low-cost green molecules to catalyse India\u2019s and the world\u2019s decarbonisation,  said Mahesh Kolli, President of AM Green.This partnership is an extension of the collaboration between Keppel and Greenko that was signed in October 2022 to explore the feasibility of jointly developing a green ammonia production facility of at least 250,000 tonnes per year in India. The facility is envisaged to be powered by a portfolio of up to 1.3 GW of solar and wind energy projects, firmed by pumped hydro-storage.",

        "articleBody": "Adani group will spend Rs 7 lakh crore in capital expenditure over the next 10 years and its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani has shared some details of the plans which will further consolidate the conglomerate's position as infrastructure leader in India.Adani in posts on X, formerly Twitter, has over the last few days detailed 'green' initiatives of the investment plan across some verticals of the apples-to-airport conglomerate. The portfolio recently announced its plan to invest over Rs 7 lakh crore over the next 10 years to consolidate its preeminent position as the largest infrastructure player in India,  Adani Energy Solutions said in a stock exchange filing.While flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd incubates and develops new businesses spanning mining, airports, defence and aerospace, solar manufacturing, roads, metro and rail, data centres and resource management, its ports business is on a greening drive. By 2025, we will set a national benchmark being the only carbon-neutral port operations and be net zero for APSEZ by 2040. Our climate-friendly transformation includes electrifying all cranes, switching all diesel-based internal transfer vehicles to battery-based ITVs, and installing an additional 1000 MW of captive renewable capacity,  Adani said in a post on X.Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone is the nation's largest seaport operator in the country, with ports on both east and west coasts. Our dedication to protecting the environment is also reflected in our expanding mangrove plantations, aiming for a remarkable 5000 hectares by FY 25. This is yet another step towards a greener future and further testament of our commitment to climate stewardship,  he said.This is alongside the fast-expanding renewable energy business.Sharing pictures of the massive construction work in Kuch desserts in Gujarat, Adani said his group is building  the world's largest green energy park . This monumental project, covering 726 sq km in the challenging Rann desert, is visible even from space. We will generate 30GW to power over 20 million homes. Also, just 150 km away, in our Karmabhoomi Mundra, we are creating one of the globe's most extensive and integrated renewable energy manufacturing ecosystems for solar and wind,  he said. This marks a significant milestone in India's journey towards sustainable energy, underlining our commitment to the Solar Alliance and the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Continuing on the green business, he said Adani Total Gas Ltd - the group's city gas firm - is on a  massive expansion  with  CNG and piped natural gas, compressed biogas, and e-mobility.ATGL retails CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to households for cooking and industries across several cities in the country. Alongside this, it is setting up electric vehicle (EV) charging stations as well as building plants that will turn agri waste into gas that can be used in city gas operations. We are on target for installing 75,000 EV charging stations by 2030. All of our own 50 sites are now powered by rooftop solar panels. Our operations vehicle fleet, covering 37 million km yearly, completely switched from diesel to CNG,  Adani said.Adani group has in recent years ventured into newer businesses including data centres, cement, telecom and media.It ventured into the airport business in 2019, after it won operation and management contracts for six airports of Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram. Besides, it holds 73 per cent of Mumbai International Airport Ltd, which, in turn, holds 74 per cent of Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd. Adani's #MumbaiAirport is redefining excellence in aviation! It's now the best in Asia Pacific for Services according to ASQ, in the 40 million+ passenger category,  the chairman said in a separate post.With the feat of handling 1,032 flights in a single day on one runway, the airport is also leading in sustainability. We proudly operate on 100 per cent green energy, making us an entirely sustainable airport. Moreover, we are 3rd in Asia Pacific to reach Level 4+ 'Transition' of ACA Program of ACI, aligning our CO2 management with global climate objectives. Our next goal? Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2029!  he added.Being the electricity supplier to Mumbai, Adani said group firm  Adani Electricity stands out with its green initiatives . We are on course to provide 60 per cent renewable electricity to Mumbai by 2027, setting a global record for a major city. Currently, over 38 per cent of our supply is green. This Diwali, we achieved a landmark by fuelling Mumbai entirely with 100 per cent renewable energy, demonstrating our dedication to a sustainable future,  he said.On the cement business, he said Ambuja and ACC are leading a sustainable revolution in the cement industry. Over 90 per cent of our cement production is now blended cement recycling waste fly ash and slag. This significant shift not only enhances the environmental footprint of our cement but also marks a substantial step towards sustainability. Additionally, we are committed to powering 60 per cent of our cement production with renewable energy sources by 2028. This ambitious goal will establish us as a frontrunner in the global arena of sustainable cement production,  he added.Adani said the group is  committed to plant 100 million trees by 2030, one of the most ambitious pledges by an Indian corporate globally. Already at 29 million, we continue to give our best for enhancing biodiversity, climate resilience, and rural livelihoods. Our goal: 37 million mangroves on India's coasts and 63 million inland trees.  ",

        "articleBody": "The government on Friday asserted that it is committed to meeting the 20 per cent ethanol blending target by 2025-26 and said the ban on the use of sugarcane juice and sugar syrup has been imposed as a  temporary  step due to lack of clarity on cane output for the current season. However, the government has a plan in place to promote ethanol production through various feedstock such as B and C-heavy molasses, damaged rice and maize. The government also said the situation has not reached a stage for the country to undertake the import of ethanol. In 2022-23 ethanol supply year (November-October), the government achieved 12 per cent blending of ethanol with petrol. The target for the current year is 15 per cent for which 690 litres of ethanol would be required. On Thursday, the food ministry banned the use of sugarcane juice and sugar syrup for making ethanol in the 2023-24 ethanol supply year amid a likely fall in cane production owing to drought and rainfall in key producing states. In a joint media briefing, Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra and Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain dispelled market rumours regarding the adverse impact on the ethanol blending programme because of the ban.  The government is fully committed to the ethanol blending programme. Absolutely, there is no question of dilution of our commitment to that programme,  Jain said. In 2021-22 supply year, the government had achieved 10 per cent ethanol blending well in advance. In 2022-23 despite concerns over rice supply which FCI had stopped, the ethanol blending of over 12 per cent was achieved. The ethanol blending target for 2023-24 is 15 per cent for which 690 litres of ethanol would be required. The oil marketing companies have already secured bids for a supply of 500 crore litres for this supply year, he said. Both Petroleum and Food Secretaries also clarified that the B-heavy molasses will be allowed for the current offers received by the OMCs. Additional B-heavy molasses will be allowed in the future subject to monthly review.  OMCs have secured bids for supply of B-heavy molasses for the first cycle. As and when they float bids for the second cycle, by then a better picture will be available not just to the government but also for sugar mills,  Jain said. However, the long-term plan is intact.  What we are seeing now is a temporary pause and this is subject to a review,  he added. According to Food Secretary Chopra, the country's total sugarcane production is estimated to be quite less as compared to last year. As per the first advance estimate of the agriculture ministry, sugarcane production will be lower at 434.8 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as against 494.2 million tonnes.   We were anticipating cane production to be low but didn't anticipate it will go down further. The recent rains have brought the recovery per cent further down. The drought in Maharashtra and Karnataka is worrying,  he said.  As of now, we are estimating sugar production of 32.3 - 33 million tonne for the 2023-24 season (October-September), as against 37.3 million tonnes in the previous season,  Chopra said and added there would be 22-40 per cent reduction in sugar production in Karnataka and Maharashtra this season. On the promotion of maize as feedstock for ethanol making, the Secretary said the agriculture ministry is working with the Ludhiana-based Institute of Maize and Distilleries to come out with a scheme to increase productivity and production from the current 36 million tonnes. Meanwhile, the committee of ministers has approved a scheme whereby cooperatives Nafed and NCCF will procure maize directly from farmers at a minimum support price (MSP) and supply to grain-based distilleries at MSP plus mandi tax. The incidental expenditure incurred by NAFED and NCCF will be borne by the Food Ministry. This will kick start and nudge everybody to adopt maize as feedstock for ethanol production, he said. There are about 120 grain-based distilleries in the country which can use maize as feedstock for making ethanol.  We are coming into that phase of the ethanol blending programme where we will focusing on much more on maize. The simple reason is we do not have much area under cultivation of sugarcane,  the Petroleum Secretary added.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The last date to submit bids for green hydrogen and electrolyser manufacturing projects under the government's SIGHT Scheme ends on December 12, Parliament was informed on Thursday. In January 2023, the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore with an aim to make India a global hub for manufacturing this clean source of energy.  The mission is expected to lead to development of 5 Million Metric Tons per annum of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030, New and Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said in Lok Sabha.   Request for selection (RfS) has also been issued for selection of green hydrogen producers for setting up production facilities of 4,50,000 tonnes for green hydrogen in India under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Scheme (Mode-1-Tranche-I) on July 10, 2023. Last date for submission of bids is December 12, 2023,  he said.  Singh further said that December 12, is also the last date for submission of bids for the selection of electrolyser manufacturers for setting up 1.5 GW annual electrolyser manufacturing capacities under SIGHT Scheme (Tranche-I) issued on July 7 2023.  The mission aims to develop India as a global hub for production, usage and exports of green hydrogen and its derivatives. It is expected to promote multilateral engagement and collaboration with various international efforts in hydrogen and fuel cells.  Singh further said that India and Saudi Arabia signed an MoU in the fields of electrical interconnection, green/clean hydrogen and supply chains on October 8, 2023.  This strategic collaboration is expected to be advantageous for both countries, as they can leverage each others' capabilities to foster the growth of Green Hydrogen ecosystem within their respective nations, he said.  The G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration affirmed 'G20 High Level Voluntary Principles on Hydrogen' to build a sustainable and equitable global hydrogen ecosystem that benefits all nations. The Declaration also emphasised a free and fair trade of hydrogen in line with WTO rules supported by resilient and diversified supply chains, Singh said.  In a separate reply, Singh said the mission provides for setting up of two green hydrogen hubs in the initial phase.  The Ministry of Ports, shipping and Waterways has identified three major ports -- Deendayal, Paradip and V.O. Chidambaranar (Tuticorin) Ports to be developed as hydrogen hubs, he said.  A Working Group has been constituted under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) for establishment of a robust framework of regulations, codes and standards for green hydrogen, which forwarded its first set of recommendations to the concerned regulatory agencies in May, 2023, which covers Hydrogen Storage dispensing also.",

        "articleBody": "India's installed renewable energy capacity is expected to increase to about 170 GW by March 2025 from the level of 132 GW as of October 2023, according to research agency ICRA.Thereafter, the capacity addition is likely to be supported by the significant improvement in tendering activity in the current fiscal with over 16 GW projects bid out so far and another 17 GW bids underway by the Central nodal agencies. This is in line with the 50 GW annual bidding trajectory announced by the Government of India in March 2023.\u201cThe sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices, abeyance of the ALMM order till March 2024, and the timeline extension approved for solar and hybrid projects is expected to lead to an improvement in RE capacity addition to 20 GW in FY2024 from 15 GW in FY2023,  said Vikram V, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, adding that this along with the growing project pipeline is likely to support the scale-up in capacity addition to 25 GW in FY2025, mainly driven by the solar power segment.However, challenges remain on the execution front concerning delays in land acquisition and transmission connectivity, which could hamper the capacity addition prospects.The sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices by 65% and 50%, respectively, over the past 12 months is leading to a healthy improvement in debt coverage metrics for the upcoming solar power projects.Benefitting from this, for a solar power project with a bid tariff of Rs. 2.5 per unit and sourcing modules from domestic OEMs using imported PV cells, the average DSCR has improved by over 35 bps. While this is a positive in the near term, the developers would remain exposed to movement in imported solar PV cell and wafer prices, till the development of fully integrated module manufacturing units in India.ICRA said the rise in the RE capacity over the next six years is estimated to increase the share of RE plus large hydro in the all-India electricity generation from 23% in FY2023 to around 40% in FY2030. Given the intermittency associated with RE generation, the availability of RTC supply from RE sources remains important.This can be made possible through the use of wind and solar power projects complemented with energy storage systems.\u201cThe tariffs discovered in the RE-RTC tenders so far remain highly competitive against the conventional sources, with recent bid tariffs in the range of Rs. 4.0-4.5 per unit, well below the Rs. 5.2 per unit discovered in the recent medium-term bid for supply from coal-based projects,  said Vikram adding that the share of RE-based RTC projects is expected to rise in the upcoming bids as already seen from the tenders issued by the Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) in the current fiscal.The returns for the winning developer under the RTC bids remain linked with the cost of the storage component, apart from the cost associated with the wind and solar components. Further, based on the prevailing capital cost of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and pumped hydro storage projects (PSP) projects, the viability of the RTC projects remains relatively better with the use of PSP capacity.The state distribution utilities (discoms) have shown an improved discipline in making payments to power generators, including RE IPPs, following the implementation of the late payment surcharge (LPS) rules in June 2022.Discoms in most key states are clearing dues within three months from the billing date to RE IPPs over the past 15 months. Moreover, the past dues are being cleared through installments under the LPS scheme. The sustainability of this trend would depend on the improvement in the financial profile of the discoms, which in turn is linked to the implementation of reform measures by the states.",

        "articleBody": "Indian billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s conglomerate is set to shed light on its plans for $1.25 billion of Adani Green Energy Ltd. notes that come due next year.The group, whose interests stretch from ports to solar energy and coal, is expected to come up with the first blueprints for redeeming or rolling over its overseas bonds since the scathing fraud claims by shortseller Hindenburg Research. That\u2019s because the contractual documents of two Adani Green securities require several months advance notice. In one case, the deadline for a refinancing plan is on Friday.\u201cWe are coming close to timelines where we would like to see a concrete and definitive plan\u201d Abhishek Dangra, a Singapore-based infrastructure analyst at S&P Global said.While there have been no suggestions Adani won\u2019t meet the deadlines and the conglomerate even pre-paid debt this year, its finances are under scrutiny after Hindenburg\u2019s allegations of malfeasance triggered a spike in its dollar bond yields. Adani relies on the global market for 80% of its debt raising, according to its chief financial officer. The group denied all of Hindenburg\u2019s claims and called them \u201cbogus.\u201dThe group and its bankers have begun exploratory talks about financing plans, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The group is exploring multiple options for the Adani Green bonds due in 2024, such as refinancing them with new notes or taking out a loan, they said.The first note to come due in 2024 is one by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd., while debt issued by Green matures on Sept. 8. That bond requires a roadmap be submitted nine months ahead of the date of maturity. That\u2019s on Friday.The security sold by Green and its subsidiaries due on Dec. 10 mandates a finance plan be submitted to noteholders at least 12 months and one day in advance of the due date, according to the offering circular seen by Bloomberg. That deadline would be on Saturday.A spokesman for Adani did note respond when asked by Bloomberg about plans for the maturing bonds and whether investors had been informed of them. The representative also didn\u2019t comment on the talks with bankers.While S&P doesn\u2019t rate Adani Green, it does rate the December 2024 debt issued by its subsidiary companies under the Adani Green Restricted Group 1 umbrella. Dangra, the analyst, said the Ports business had enough cash on hand and a healthy cash flow so as to redeem its 2024 bond from its own funds.Group CFO Jugeshinder Singh already touched on the conglomerate\u2019s objectives, saying at an event in Mumbai on Dec. 1 that Adani Green would be one of the firms issuing dollar bonds over the next year. The group will also infuse money to repay that unit\u2019s bonds maturing in September and December next year, potentially in July to avoid a prepayment penalty, Singh said.He also told reporters on Friday that the Adani Green December bond \u201cis the one we need to refinance.\u201d When asked about the September bond, he said a refinancing plan had been announced in July, without elaborating.The Adani Ports debt will be redeemed \u201cout of its cash,\u201d he said.The company spokesman didn\u2019t respond to Bloomberg\u2019s request for clarifications on the CFO\u2019s remarks, including details on the refinancing plan announced in July.Having been forced to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale as a result of allegations of fraud and malfeasance levied by Hindenburg Research in late January, Adani and his lieutenants have sought to burnish their image as reliable borrowers.They prepaid debt, held in-person meetings from Hong Kong to London to reassure investors, and spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying back the debt of units including Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd. and Adani Ports.Adani successfully refinanced the debt to purchase Ambuja Cements Ltd. and ACC Ltd., and it also won fresh equity capital from GQG Partners LLC.Just this week, Adani Green Energy raised a $1.4 billion loan for a renewable energy project in Gujarat. Its shares surged by a record 20% in a single day on the news.\u201cThe group has demonstrated access to equity funding,\u201d Dangra said. \u201cWe have seen external lenders extending credit lines. We now have to see capital market access - that is the next step.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Guwahati: Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu reiterated that hydropower is one of the most potential resources for a aatma-nirbhar (self-reliant ) Arunachal Pradesh and the way forward to development.Joining the joyous celebration of Podi Barbi of the Bokar (Adi) community at Monigong in Shi-Yomi district, Khandu said that the hydropower potential of the state if utilized sensibly and scientifically can become the game-changer for a revenue-starved state like Arunachal Pradesh.\u201cYes, we have challenges in terms of difficult terrains and topography. We need to convert these challenges into resources and hydropower is one way of doing it,\u201d he said.Khandu revealed that as many as five hydropower projects are in pipeline in the district, specifically in the region adjoining Tato, the district headquarters. These are Tato-I Hydro Electric Project (186 MW), Tato-II (700 MW), Heo (240 MW), Naying (1000 MW) and Hirong Hydro Electric Project (500 MW).He informed that all the five projects will be executed by the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited (NEEPCO), a Government of India enterprise, replacing private agencies engaged earlier.\u201cThese projects, in fact, were to be executed by private companies that had entered into MoUs with previous state governments, but they failed. We made it a point that only trustworthy agencies with expertise and central government back-up will be engaged. Hence, with the support of the central government under Narendra Modi, we are roping in only central government enterprises like NEEPCO, NHPC, SJVN and others to develop hydropower potential in the state,\u201d he said.Urging the people of the area to support and cooperate with the executing agencies, Khandu said that while the state as a whole will benefit, especially with its 12% share of free power, Shi-Yomi district will exclusively benefit from the 2% - 1% from the state government and 1% from the project developer - as incorporated in the state power policy for local area development.He pointed out that a 2% share from about 2500 MW of power generation would be huge and can entirely change the scenario in the district. \u201cOur objective is the development of our villages. The more we (state government) earn, the more we invest in developmental projects,\u201d Khandu added.He informed that in order to bring in development in rural areas of the state, the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) are being strengthened with more power and finance. Expressing hope that proposed hydropower projects will start functioning soon, Khandu assured that once it happens, funds allocated to PRIs will exponentially grow each year.\u201cThe state\u2019s revenue in 2016 was Rs 900 crore. Then we formed our government and went for drastic reforms. You will not believe, in 2023 our state-owned revenue clocked Rs 3500 crore!\u201d he informed.Responding to a four-point memorandum demanding upgradation of the Monigong General Ground, construction of a new festival ground, a multipurpose hall and gallery in Pidi circle and creation of a new administrative circle called Pangja submitted by the locals, Khandu assured that all will be fulfilled.\u201cI assure that the new administrative circle will be approved next year but let us develop this General Ground for multipurpose uses. Instead of going for a new festival ground, this General Ground can be developed in such a way that it can also be used for all festivals and functions. Rest assured, a multipurpose hall and gallery in Pidi circle will also be sanctioned soon,\u201d he said.",

In January 2023, the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore with an aim to make India a global hub for manufacturing this clean source of energy. Green hydrogen has the potential to replace fossil fuels including natural gas, either as a source of energy or as a feedstock, thereby contributing to reduction in dependence on import of fossil fuels, the Minister for New and Renewable Energy informed the Rajya Sabha. The mission envisages substitution of grey hydrogen with green hydrogen in industries such as fertilizer production, petroleum refining, steel, shipping etc. reducing carbon footprint and dependence on imported fossil fuels, he said.  The quantum of such reduction in imports is estimated at Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030,  Singh said. The minister also said that for production of 1 kilogramme of green hydrogen via electrolysis, around 10 litres of demineralized water is needed. Accordingly, the demineralized water requirement for 5 MMT of green hydrogen production per annum will be about 50 Million Cubic Meter (MCM) per annum. A majority of the green hydrogen production plants are expected to come up near port locations as per the industry feedback. In such cases, desalinised sea water could also be used for green hydrogen production. Since water is a state subject, the project developers will have to comply with the state regulations for securing the water supply, Singh said.",

The catalytic grant funding from the BFET program, expects to mobilize a total of over $1.4 billion of capital through two fund managers, including Eversource, to advance emerging markets\u2019 energy transition efforts and help limit global average temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.The grant funding program, announced first in April, intended to make one or two awards of non-repayable catalytic capital from the U.S. government, totaling up to $15 million.Eversource, in a statement, said that it will launch innovative financial vehicles to deploy capital in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and other South and Southeast Asia markets. Investments will address both the supply (renewable energy, energy storage, energy efficiency, waste-to-energy sectors) and demand (e-mobility, urban sustainability, sustainable food and agriculture) sides of transition to clean energy, the fund manager said in its statement.\u201cEversource\u2019s selection for the catalytic concessional capital by USAID and IFU, Denmark was the result of a rigorous process of evaluation of over 30 fund managers from across the globe. This catalytic capital will provide the impetus to mobilize private capital at scale and deploy in climate business across developing Asian economies driving twin outcomes of financial returns and climate impact,\u201d said Dhanpal Jhaveri, CEO, Eversource Capital.The grant funding was announced at the COP28 by John Kerry, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate.\u201cThe BFET programme is a demonstration of how blended finance can be scaled effectively and how more money can be raised for climate impact. I am convinced that this is the most significant economic opportunity presented to the world in all human history. I congratulate Eversource Capital to be one of the two winners here,\u201d said Kerry.Eversource has raised and deployed over $740 million via India\u2019s largest climate impact fund.

        "articleBody": "Rising from the bare expanse of the large salt desert that separates India from Pakistan is what will likely be the world's largest renewable energy project when completed three years from now. The solar and wind energy project will be so big that it will be visible from space, according to developers of what is called the Khavda renewable energy park, named after the village nearest to the project site.  At the site, thousands of laborers install pillars on which solar panels will be mounted. The pillars rise like perfectly aligned concrete cactuses that stretch as far as the eye can see. Other workers are building foundations for enormous wind turbines to be installed; they also are transporting construction material, building substations and laying wires for miles.  When completed, the project will be about as large as Singapore, spreading out over 726 square kilometers (280 square miles). The Indian government estimates it will cost at least $2.26 billion. Shifting to renewable energy is a key issue at the ongoing COP28 climate summit. Some leaders have voiced support for a target of tripling renewable energy worldwide in any final agreement while curbing use of coal, oil and natural gas, which spew planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. What makes this heavy industrial activity peculiar is that it's taking place in the middle of the Rann of Kutch in western India's Gujarat state. The Rann is an unforgiving salt desert and marshland at least 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) from the nearest human habitation but just a short army truck ride away from one of the world's most tense international borders separating the two South Asian nations. GROUND ZERO OF INDIA'S CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION When The Associated Press visited the renewable energy park, two days of unseasonal heavy rains had left the ground muddy and water logged since the only escape for water in this rough terrain is evaporation. This made it even harder for the workers to do their job.Also Read: Adani Green seals its largest project financing of $1.36 billion Notwithstanding the tough conditions, an estimated 4,000 workers and 500 engineers have been living in makeshift camps for the better part of the past year toiling to get this project up and running. Once completed, it will supply 30 gigawatts of renewable energy annually, enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes. As India aims to install 500 gigawatts of clean energy by the end of the decade and to reach net zero emissions by 2070, this project site will likely contribute significantly to the world's most populous country's transition to producing energy from non-carbon spewing sources. As things stand, India is still mostly powered by fossil fuels, especially coal, which generate more than 70% of India's electricity. Renewable energy currently contributes about 10% of India's electricity needs. The country is also currently the third-largest emitter of planet-warming gases behind China and the United States.  There are people working here from all over India,  said KSRK Verma, project head for Adani Green Energy Limited, the renewable energy arm of the Adani Group, which the Indian government has contracted to build 20 gigawatts of the project. Verma, with over 35 years of experience building dams across turbulent South Asian rivers and enormous natural gas tanks under the Bay of Bengal, says this is one of the most difficult projects he's undertaken.   It's not at all (an) easy site to work at, there is no habitation, the land is marshy, there are a lot of high winds, rains and this is a high earthquake prone area,  said Vneet Jaain, managing director of Adani Green at its headquarters in the city of Ahmedabad.  Jaain who has overseen multiple ambitious projects for the Adani Group said the first six months were spent just building basic infrastructure.  From April this year is when we started working on the actual project,  he added. The Adani Group has been in the limelight this year ever since the U.S.-based short-selling Hindenburg Research firm accused the Group and its head, Gautam Adani, of  brazen stock manipulation  and  accounting fraud.  Adani Group has called the allegations baseless. Jaain of Adani Green says the allegations have had little impact on its ongoing projects including work at the Khavda renewable energy park. AN EXAMPLE TO EMULATE  Twenty years ago, India was exactly where a vast expanse of (the) developing world was,  Ajay Mathur, director general of the International Solar Alliance, said of the country's renewable energy production. The alliance has 120 member countries and promotes renewable energy - primarily solar - across the world.  About 200 kilometers (124 miles) away in the industrial city of Mundra, also located along the Gujarat state's coastline, the Adani Group is manufacturing the solar and wind energy parts needed for the project. It's one of the few locations in India where most solar energy components are made from scratch. Some of the factories are run like laboratories, with protective gear, face masks and head covers required to avoid dust particles that can compromise solar cells. The nearby wind energy factory aims to produce 300 turbines a year, with each blade stretching nearly 79 meters (86 yards) and weighing 22 metric tons (24 tons). Each wind turbine generator is capable of producing 5.2 megawatts of clean energy. They will be India's biggest.  As Mathur of the solar alliance said,  India has traveled a long way,  and its largescale renewable energy projects including the Khavda park will be inspiring for other developing countries.  Here is a country that was exactly where they are today and was able to make the change,  he said. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT While acknowledging the importance of transitioning to renewable energy, environmental experts and social activists say India's decision to allow clean energy projects without any environmental impact assessments is bound to have adverse consequences.  The salt desert is a unique landscape  that is  rich in flora and fauna,  including flamingos, desert foxes and migratory bird species that fly from Europe and Africa to winter in this region, according to Abi T Vanak, a conservation scientist with the Bengaluru-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment. Vanak has overseen multiple environment-related research projects in the Kutch region. Kutch and other similar regions are classified as  wastelands,  by the Indian government - and Vanak says this is extremely unfortunate.  They are not recognized as valid ecosystems,  he said. With renewable energy projects exempt from environmental impact assessments,  There is no system in place  to determine the best places for them, according to Sandip Virmani, an environmentalist based in Kutch.  At a little over 45,000 square kilometers (17,374.5 square miles), the Kutch district is as big as Denmark and is India's largest district. Given this, Virmani said there is enough land in Kutch for various renewable energy projects. But he fears that dairies and other local businesses in the region might be impacted by large-scale projects.  It has to be in the context of not compromising on another economy,  he said. Meanwhile, longtime residents are still waiting to see how this huge project near their village will affect them.  Hirelal Rajde, 75, who has spent most of his life in Khavda, is mindful of the upcoming energy project as well as the increase in tourism in recent years in this otherwise desolate region.  I think these developments are both good and bad,  said Rajde.   I think overall though it will benefit more than it will cause problems,  he said.  I tell everyone who lives here to hold onto their land, don't sell it. In a few years, I tell them they'll have so much business that they won't be able to rest even at night. ",

The quantum of green ammonia will be up to 20 per cent of the total fuel requirement, the company said in a statement.   Adani Power has undertaken a ground-breaking green ammonia combustion pilot project at its Mundra plant as part of its multipronged decarbonization initiatives. As part of the project, the Mundra plant will co-fire up to 20 per cent green ammonia in the boiler of a conventional coal-fired 330 MW unit,  the statement said.  Green ammonia, produced from green hydrogen, which in turn is produced through electrolysis using renewable energy, would be a feedstock for the boilers.  Ammonia does not contain carbon and there will be no CO2 emission from its combustion, making it a long-term carbon-neutral alternative to fossil fuels.  Adani Power has partnered with IHI and Kowa-Japan for the pilot project and examine its expansion to other APL units and stations as well. Kowa is active in energy saving and energy creating products, while IHI is a heavy industry company which has ammonia firing technology.  Combustion tests at IHI's facility in Japan have begun with 20 per cent ammonia blending, simulating Mundra Power Station equipment. Mundra plant is the first location outside of Japan to have been selected for this cutting-edge green initiative.  The APL project has been selected under Japan's research agency New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).   Adani Power is fully committed to reducing its carbon footprint through adoption of latest technologies and proactive measures across our business value chain. In furtherance of this vision, we are happy to partner with IHI and Kowa for blending green ammonia for our Mundra plant, which will reduce CO2 emissions.   We will continue to integrate cutting-edge technologies increasingly to reduce emissions in the intermediate term,  said Anil Sardana, Managing Director, APL.",

Kennedy (JFK) International Airport, according to the official website of the UK government.UK's Transport Secretary travelled on the flight alongside Virgin Atlantic's Chief Executive Shai Weiss and Virgin's founder, Sir Richard Branson, making the carrier the first commercial airline to fly across the pond without the use of any fossil-based jet fuel.Further, according to the UK government, the flight marks a major milestone towards making air travel more environment-friendly as the world moves towards its goal of net zero by 2050.The historic trip is powered by fuel made from waste fats that cannot enter the food chain. Repurposing waste products into jet fuel to cut emissions provides the most immediate solution to help decarbonise skies. In December 2022, the UK government awarded Euro 1 million in funding to Virgin Atlantic to support the industry in achieving the first transatlantic flight on a commercial aircraft powered by 100 per cent SAF.The funding helped support fuel testing and the flight's operational delivery while also providing an opportunity to generate important data that will accelerate SAF approval and boost our understanding of its efficiency.SAF has a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of around 70 per cent when compared to standard jet fuel over its life cycle, allowing greener travel and keeping the UK connected to the world.With the world about to convene in Dubai COP28 this week, Tuesday lays down a marker that the UK is already taking action when it comes to tackling the decarbonisation challenges that face the transport sector, the UK government said.The government said the flight shows the future of flying, following in the footsteps of John Alcock and Arthur Brown, who flew the first non-stop transatlantic flight in 1919, opening the eyes of the world to the potential of long-haul air travel.

        "articleBody": "India will for the first time on November 29 invite bids for 20 critical mineral blocks, including lithium and graphite. This is not only seen to boost economic development but also a part of the nation's strategy to ensure adequate domestic resources of essential raw materials cruciual for powering the green energy transition. Twenty blocks of critical and strategic minerals being auctioned are spread across the country. This is a landmark initiative that will boost our economy, enhance national security and support our transition to a clean energy future,  the government said in a statement.The auction will be held online, using a transparent two-stage ascending forward auction process. Eligible bidders will be chosen based on the highest percentage of the quoted value of dispatched minerals they offer, the government said.Details of the mineral blocks, auction terms, timelines etc. can be accessed on MSTC auction platform at www.mstcecommerce.com/auctionhome/mlcl/index.jsp from 6 pm on 29th November, 2023.Critical minerals serve essential roles in various sectors, including renewable energy, defense, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, high-tech electronics, telecommunications, transportation, and the establishment of gigafactories.Moreover, India aims to reach a milestone of 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030. This ambitious energy transition plan is poised to stimulate demand for electric cars, wind and solar energy projects, as well as battery storage systems, consequently amplifying the need for critical minerals.India changed its mining rules in July in a bid to boost exploration of some critical minerals like lithium by allowing private miners to search for the materials. The reforms will be key for auctioning lithium blocks recently identified in Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka state.In October, India's cabinet had approved royalty rates for three critical and strategic minerals. The approved royalty rates for lithium, Niobium and REE are 3 per cent, 3 per cent and one per cent, respectively.State-run enterprises have been actively scouting the globe in search of these valuable mineral resources. Meanwhile, prominent energy giants like Coal India Ltd. and NTPC Ltd. are meticulously strategizing their foray into the mining sector to tap into these essential materials.Additionally, the establishment of Khanij Bidesh India Ltd., a joint venture involving three government-owned companies, further underscores India's commitment to securing critical mineral assets on an international scale, with a primary focus on regions such as Australia and South America.The scarcity of these minerals in select nations may create vulnerabilities within the supply chain. The future of the global economy hinges on technologies reliant on minerals like lithium, graphite, cobalt, titanium, and rare earth elements, the government said today. India has been exploring ways to secure supplies of lithium, a critical raw material used to make electric vehicle batteries. In February, India found its first lithium deposits in Jammu and Kashmir with estimated reserves of 5.9 million tonnes.Lithium-ion battery costs rose last year for the first time in the EV era, according to BloombergNEF. Elon Musk bemoaned lithium\u2019s \u201cinsane\u201d rally and said high raw material costs were among Tesla Inc.\u2019s biggest headwinds.As the world moves away from gasoline-fueled combustion engines, demand for lithium, nickel, cobalt and other metals that go into lithium-ion batteries is soaring.",

Initially, 1 per cent of biogas will be blended in gas used in automobiles and household kitchens for cooking from April 2025, a government statement said. The share will be increased to around 5 per cent by 2028.The government also plans to have 1 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in aircraft turbine fuel by 2027, doubling to 2 per cent in 2028. The SAF targets will initially apply to international flights, the statement said.This is in line with the aim of achieving net zero emissions targets by 2070. CBG Blending Obligation (CBO) will promote production and consumption of Compressed Biogas (CBG) in the country,  it said.  The key objectives of the CBO are to stimulate demand for CBG in city gas distribution sector, import substitution for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), saving in forex, promoting circular economy and to assist in achieving the target of net zero emission. The CBO will encourage investment of around Rs 37,500 crores and facilitate establishment of 750 CBG projects by 2028-29, the statement said. The CBG blending will be voluntary till FY 2024-2025 (April 2024 to March 2025) and the mandatory blending obligation will start from FY 2025-26.  CBO shall be kept as 1 per cent, 3 per cent and 4 per cent of total CNG/PNG consumption for FY 2025-26, 2026- 27 and 2027-28 respectively. From 2028-29 onwards CBO will be 5 per cent,  the statement said. A Central Repository Body (CRB) shall monitor and implement the blending mandate based on the operational guidelines. Also, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF/Bio- ATF) initial indicative blending percentage targets were set.  Based on the comments received from the stakeholders, the capacities of Sustainable Aviation Fuel plants coming up in the country and projected ATF sales, the following initial indicative blending percentages of SAF in ATF are approved - 1 per cent SAF indicative blending target in 2027 (initially for international flights), 2 per cent SAF blending target in 2028 (initially for international flights),  the statement added.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India on Friday invited Global South to join the recently launched Global Biofuels Alliance, saying it is willing to share its expertise with developing and less developed nations. A global alliance for promoting biofuels was launched at the Group of 20 leaders meeting in September with a view to reducing emissions in the transportation and industrial sectors.  The Global Biofuel Alliance, which includes top producers Brazil and the US, will help build the worldwide market for trade in biofuel, which is obtained from biomass.  Speaking at the 2nd Voice of Global South Summit, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said India achieved the target of mixing 10 per cent ethanol in petrol in May 2022, five months ahead of the deadline, and has advanced the deadline for doping 20 per cent ethanol in petrol by five years to 2025.  Turning biomass into fuel helped the world's third largest energy consumer provide an additional source of income for farmers as well as cut emissions.   The Global Biofuels Alliance is a multi-stakeholder alliance of governments, international organisations and industries which is intended to expedite global uptake of biofuels. The alliance presently has 22 member countries and 12 international organisations and is continuously expanding. I invite countries of the Global South, those who have already not joined the GBA, to join us where we can collaborate further towards a cleaner and greener future,  Puri said.  Going up from a 1.4 per cent biofuels blending in petrol in 2014, India achieved 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol in May 2022, helping boost farmers' income with a payment of USD 8.7 billion and also lowering carbon dioxide emission by more than 40 million metric tonnes in last 9 years, he said.   India is keen to collaborate with countries of the global south, including for knowledge sharing, technology transfer, joint R&D activities, and development of human capabilities to name just a few areas,  he said.  Puri said India stands committed to achieving net zero by 2070, reaching the nation's non-fossil energy capacity of 500 GW and meeting 50 per cent of our energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030.  Today, India has become the world's largest producer of renewable energy with 40 per cent of its installed electricity capacity coming from non-fossil fuel sources, he said, adding that solar tariffs have come down from around Rs 7 per unit in 2014 to Rs 1.99 a unit now. Similarly, wind power has fallen from Rs 3.5 per unit in 2014 to Rs 2.77.  India has also launched a national green hydrogen mission with a target of producing 5 million tonnes by 2030, making India a global hub for the production, usage and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives, he said.   In recent times, the world has faced a truly global energy crisis born out of increased energy demand from the post-Covid recovery and geopolitical disruptions, resulting in spikes in conventional fuel prices,  he said.  Effects of these extreme volatility are magnified in developing economies.   Against this backdrop, achieving energy transition is contingent on global partnerships.  Such a collaborative approach will result in optimum resource distribution, technological tie-ups and the sharing of best practices,  he said.  Currently, India ranks as the third largest energy consumer globally.  We are on the rapid trajectory of becoming a 5 trillion dollar GDP economy by 2025. Consecutively, our energy demand is poised to grow exponentially. It is estimated that India alone will account for 25 per cent of the global energy incremental demand growth between 2020 and 2040, the largest incremental share by any nation.   The minister said India has taken  a pragmatic and astute middle path that underscores commitment to mitigating climate change while supporting national interests and meeting India's energy demand.    India's broad diversification of its energy policy will help facilitate enhanced energy security. Towards this, the government of India has taken several steps including transformational policy reforms while focusing on waves of future that are non-conventional energy such as biofuels, compressed biogas, green hydrogen, solar and wind,  he added.",

A key change which prompted the rejig in plans and indeed opting for a ramp-up was introduction of the infrastructure investment trusts (Invits), Mahindra and Mahindra's managing director and chief executive Anish Shah said. Speaking at a Ficci event, Shah said the renewables business, for which the company has partnered with a global investor, will grow 5x in the next five years. He said the diversified grouping, which has interests in the automotive and tech businesses, looks at scale when looking at a new business and prefers not to be in a business at all if it cannot do anything on a large scale. With the renewables business, the capital was a  problem  because of the consumption of resources and also piling up of debt. Shah said the company has a clear plan for the business now, and will be aiming to grow the same going ahead. As per the group's website, the renewables business has a capacity of 1.55 GW. Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board had last year announced to buy a 30 per cent stake in Mahindra Susten Private Limited at an equity value of Rs 2,371 crore and also proposed to set up the Invit as part of the same transaction. Meanwhile, Shah said India has made its place of leadership well known on the world stage and pointed out that strong governance and vibrant capital markets are a necessity for every leadership nation.",

        "articleBody": "Chennai: The Confederation of Indian Industry and Indian Green Building Council have come together to launch IGBC-Nest to the individual housing sector, aimed at controlling and limiting carbon emissions, an industry official said here on Wednesday. The move was toward achieving the country's net zero goal by 2070. IGBC has launched a framework specifically developed for residential units to build green homes that control and limit carbon emissions. 'IGBC Nest' is a first-of-its-kind eco-friendly, self-developed framework and certification that aims to bring awareness and drive the individual owners to build a sustainable home with no or meager additional cost,  CII-IGBC said in a press release. The initiative encourages the house owners to adopt green measures that are simple and have impacts on addressing resource efficiency and occupant's health and well-being.  Our mission is to ensure every building in India is a green building that will not only uplift the economic status of every homeowner but also increase life expectancy with better health benefits. IGBC's Nest framework and certification has been developed specifically for the individual homeowners to help them reduce energy cost by 20-30 per cent and reduce water requirements by 30-50 per cent,  IGBC Chennai chapter Chairman Ajit Kumar Chordia said in a press release.  We foresee this initiative playing a significant role in building a green India not for this generation but for future generations as well,  he said. The IGBC Nest framework throws light on water and energy efficiency besides harnessing solar energy. Meanwhile, officials of IGBC announced the IGBC Green Building Congress 2023 supported by the World Green Building Council scheduled to be held from November 23 on the theme --  Advancing Net Zero through decarbonization.  IGBC aims to provide a platform that brings industry leaders, policymakers, and technology providers together to exchange insights and visions on sustainable building practices during the conference.",

        "articleSection": "Industry",
        "articleBody": "Hydrogen is the most abundant gas in our universe, though its availability in its elemental form on earth is infinitesimally small. As we begin to understand its potential to mitigate climate change by acting as a reservoir of energy storage, deciphering cost-effective ways to generate, store and transport green hydrogen is amongst the top priorities for the world in the immediate future.Around 75% of all mass in the universe is made up of hydrogen and 90% of all atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Despite its abundance, harnessing its vast potential has remained elusive for mankind, at least until recently. Ever since its discovery, scientists have been experimenting to unlock the versatility of Hydrogen. Even so, it wasn\u2019t until the mid-20th century that we started looking at it as a clean and very efficient fuel source, when experimented with Hydrogen fuel cells for the Apollo missions. The potential of Hydrogen as an alternative to fossil fuels has been acknowledged and grown manifold since. Furthermore, if produced using green energy, Hydrogen can contribute to global decarbonisation and mitigating climate crisis. According to a McKinsey analysis, hydrogen could contribute to more than 20% of annual global emissions reductions by 2050. As of May 2023, more than 1,000 large-scale hydrogen projects have already been announced globally, amounting to USD 320 billion in direct investments.India\u2019s current hydrogen demand is around six million tonnes per annum, which is expected to reach 12 million tonnes by 2030. Cognizant of the need to fulfil this need through a green growth strategy, the GOI has presented its roadmap and vision for Hydrogen in the policy document of the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Under this mission, the government plans to achieve 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production by 2030 with over INR 8 lakh crore of investments, resulting in the creation of over 6 lakh jobs. The policy is a welcome step and one that was required post-haste, as the development of a green hydrogen economy will be a key component of India\u2019s ambitious economic and environmental agenda.Indigenous production and self sufficiencyIndia currently imports 40 % of its energy requirements, shelling out around USD 90 billion per year. If the National Green Hydrogen mission takes off, it could pivot India from an energy importer to a net energy provider and exporter, besides reducing our import bills for fuel. While all of this sounds great, there are certain techno-commercial challenges that need to be overcome before we can realise this dream.The key to harnessing green hydrogen lies in the electrolysers used in to generate Hydrogen. We need to support indigenous manufacturing of electrolysers through policy formulations. Local manufacture of electrolysers that meets global quality control standards will give India an important edge in the global market. Worldwide electrolyser sales have more than doubled from 200 megawatts (MW) in 2020 to 458 in 2021. As this trend is expected to continue its upward trend in the near future, the time is opportune for India to aggressively capture this market.Additionally, as Hydrogen elicits immense interest from industry and government, it makes sense to collaborate for maximising impact, and create pilot projects for green hydrogen. Creating PPP models will help to optimise resources to fullest and minimise risks. The European Commission (EC) in 2020, announced the Clean Hydrogen alliance, a PPP of multiple stakeholders to develop Europe\u2019s clean energy and zero emissions cars mission. India Inc. must work with government bodies like CII and FICCI to form such partnerships.Uninterrupted supply of water and green powerAside from the considerable capital cost in terms of the manufacture of electrolysers, the amount of fresh water and electricity needed to generate the quantities of Hydrogen required also poses a significant challenge. As a thumb rule, one needs about 10 litres of freshwater and 50 kWh of electricity to generate 1 kg of hydrogen. The cost of production of green Hydrogen ranges from USD 4.10 to USD 7 per kg.At this rate, we would need to ensure a steady supply of 50 billion litres of fresh water to achieve 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen production as stated in the National Green Hydrogen Mission policy document. This poses a major ecological and social challenge, with falling ground water levels already causing water stress across the country. We need to promote research to build technology that looks at alternatives to freshwater in the electrolysis process. Utilising grey and wastewater to channel this will further boost our circular economy aspirations.Additionally, given the intermittency of renewable energy, ensuring a continuous and consistent supply of electricity for hydrolysis will almost be impossible unless we upgrade our transmission and distribution systems, in addition to adding to renewable electricity generation infrastructure. India currently has 168.96 GW installed capacity of renewable energy, which generated 3,16,754.86 Million Units (MU) of electricity was during the year 2022-23. Not only must we exceed the Government\u2019s target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030 to become a green hydrogen surplus country, we also need to invest heavily in modernizing the grid infrastructure and using AI and other technologies to minimise variability and optimise green energy availability.Logistics of transporting HydrogenOne of the other major concerns inhibiting the scalability of hydrogen apart from production costs are the huge logistics costs involved in transportation. Hydrogen is also a flammable gas which needs to be transported in cryogenic tankers. One solution to this would be the development of generation-on-demand hydrogen, which would replace the transportation of hydrogen with the transport of raw materials like water and hydrocarbons which would then be converted to hydrogen as and when required. However, the technologies to separate Hydrogen are still developing at scale and require considerable investment.From an energy delivery standpoint as well, currently, there are charges and levies involved in transmission and procurement of green power between states and a dissonance between central and state RE policies. If we are to foster a smooth transition and uptake of green hydrogen, we need to rethink these regulations and ensure seamless nationalised transport of green energy. Akin to SEZ corridors that the GOI has promoted to foster industrial growth, we need to emulate this model and create \u201cGreen Hydrogen Industrial Parks\u2019, coupled with speedy approvals and clearances for businesses and groups who indicate interest in investing in Green Hydrogen.Overall, a robust green Hydrogen economy can unlock six lakh jobs, reduce fuel import bills, offer indigenous options for fertilisers, and reduce GHG emissions. The Government of India has already taken several steps to promote uptake of green energy. Going by the current market tailwinds, green hydrogen is slated to gallop from a brilliant theoretical idea to a massive \u201cBrahmastra\u201d against climate change! Countries that can produce green hydrogen to meet domestic consumption and export surplus have the potential to dominate the market in the coming future.",

        "articleBody": "London: Britain's aviation regulator announced Monday it has issued Virgin Atlantic with a permit for a  world-first  transatlantic flight powered entirely by sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said permission for the planned November 28 flight from London to New York follows successful  technical reviews  of the request by the British airline, which was supported by a consortium of companies.They include Boeing, Rolls-Royce, BP, and others.The aviation industry produces high levels of both carbon dioxide and non-CO2 emissions that contribute to climate change, according to scientists.Airlines are pinning their hopes on SAF -- a biofuel that produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel but is currently more expensive to produce -- to decarbonise the sector.But they have warned the transition will be gradual and costly -- and could push up ticket prices, slowing passenger demand growth. As the UK's aviation regulator, it's important that we safely enable the industry to embrace more sustainable practices and push the boundaries of what's possible to create a greener aviation industry,  CAA chief executive Rob Bishton said. This permit not only allows Virgin Atlantic and others to showcase their commitment to sustainability, but also serves as an example of how the industry is always exploring new technologies. The CAA said the permit paves the way for Virgin Atlantic to submit approval applications to regulators in the United States, Ireland and Canada, given the flight will travel through each country's airspace.The UK regulator analysed various aspects of the planned flight, including undertaking ground testing with Rolls-Royce on a Trent 1000 engine running on 100 percent SAF.The initiative, which is partly funded by the UK government, is aimed at testing and showcasing the feasibility of powering planes by sustainable fuels, according to the CAA.As part of its efforts to boost the switch, the UK government last December handed Virgin Atlantic up to \u00a31 million ($1.2 million) earmarked to support the industry achieve the first transatlantic flight powered entirely by SAF.Virgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss said getting to this point had  taken radical collaboration across our consortium partners and government .He noted the airline was committed to using 10 percent SAF by 2030, but urged the government to help create  a UK SAF industry .  We know that if we can make it, we can fly it,  Weiss added.",

        "articleBody": "MUMBAI: For the Indian auto industry, green sustainable mobility a.k.a. carbon neutrality is the new buzzword as companies go beyond electric vehicles. Passenger vehicle launches in the alternative fuel space \u2014 hybrids, CNG, electric have seen a sharp increase with traditional fuel vehicles experiencing a relative slowdown.The industry saw 24 CNG PV launches this fiscal as compared to 14 in FY 20. In the case of electric, there were 31 PV launches as compared to 7 models in FY20. Strong hybrids have also seen increased traction, with sales outpacing electric for the first time in last 2 months. Petrol model launches at 111 were lower by 21% and diesel at 54 down by 61%, according to Jato Dynamics.Even though EVs will play an important role, there seems to be a co-existence of various technologies with a substantial share of NEVs (new energy) and ICE (internal combustion engines) vehicles, say leading car makers. Maruti Suzuki senior executive director Shashank Srivastava expects 15% of the portfolio for the country's largest carmaker to be electric by 2030, with 25% strong hybrids and 60% a mix of petrol, CNG, biofuels and flexi-fuels.At the moment, CNG vehicles account for 26% of Maruti sales, with strong hybrids at 1%. The company doesn\u2019t have any electric models as of now, so the balance comprises ICE models. 104993008It is expected that the adoption rate of electric, hybrid & CNG vehicles will increase because of their lower running costs. But due to the higher cost of acquisition of electric vehicles and the lack of charging infrastructure it is the CNG & hybrid vehicles which have seen more traction with consumers, say experts.Currently 70% of vehicle sales for Hyundai come from cars with petrol and turbo technologies. This is followed by diesel at 18% and CNG at 11%. At present, electric cars account for less than 1% of total passenger car sales for Hyundai. Going forward \u201cwe believe electrics contribution will grow with higher localisation and more new models in the electric space,\u201d said Tarun Garg, COO, Hyundai Motor, which has allocated `20,000 crore over a phased 10-year period from 2023 to 2032. In the case of MG Motor, \u201cwe will have a huge focus on sustainable mobility  said deputy MD Gaurav Gupta. As the second largest EV seller in India, \u201cour EV portfolio contributes 25% of total sales volumes,\u201d he said.India's large and growing population, heavy reliance on imported oil, limited budget for new transportation infrastructure, and lack of battery raw materials necessitate a multipronged approach to fuel diversification, said Ravi Bhatia, president, Jato Dynamics.",

A representative of Adani Group declined to comment.The transaction hasn\u2019t been finished and the terms could still change. If signed before late December, it would be the one of the 20 biggest major currency loans in Asia this year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.The potential borrowing is taking place just a few weeks after Adani Group completed a $3.5 billion funding package to refinance debt used to purchase Ambuja Cements Ltd. and ACC Ltd. The capital raising is another sign the conglomerate has at least partially rebuilt investor confidence after suffering a scathing shortseller attack earlier this year that caused some banks to balk on debt refinancing.(With assistance from Divya Patil and Jacqueline Poh)",

Puri also rejected theories that biofuel will create food insecurity, saying ethanol can be made from a variety of sources.Puri said that India needs about 1,000 crore liters of ethanol for 20 per cent blending but it is achievable as India is already producing 600 crore liters of ethanol. Citing production ethanol from agricultre waste in Panipat, the minister said that ethanol could infact a support system for agriculture economy. The petroleum minister also said that India is currently blending petrol with 12 percent ethanol.  Today, no one is questioning whether we will achieve 20 percent blending by 2025. They are asking if we can go beyond it,  he said. On green hydrogen, Puri said it is the fuel of the future and will succeed in India.  Green hydrogen will succeed where there is proximity between consumption and production centres,  Puri said.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Petroliam Nasional Bhd, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the founders of Greenko Energy Holdings are investing $2 billion in AM Green, a platform that's being established for green molecules, including green hydrogen, green ammonia and other chemicals. Of this, $1.5-1.7 billion is likely to come from Malaysia's state-owned energy company, said people aware of the development. AM Green is being set up by Greenko founders Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli. Once concluded, this will be the largest foreign direct investment till date in the rapidly growing sector as corporates and governments seek ways to decarbonise their energy and consumption footprint. AM Green will act as a holding company for these green initiatives. It will be kept separate from Greenko Energy, which is one of India's leading renewable power producers. Petronas and GIC will be minority shareholders in the green ammonia unit of AM Green , said the people cited above. GIC is also the single-largest shareholder of Greenko Energy Holdings, with 52% equity ownership. Other investors are Orix Corp of Japan (22%) and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (14%). Chalamalasetty and Kolli own 12%. Petronas will be a new strategic partner in the AM Green's ammonia vertical while the Singapore fund is doubling down. The investments will go into the production of 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of green ammonia (NH3) by 2028-2030 across four-five locations such as Kakinada, Tuticorin, Mangaluru and Kandla. This will make it among the world's largest green ammonia production network with an estimated capital expenditure of $6-6.5 billion.In comparison, the $8 billion Neom green hydrogen and ammonia complex in Saudi Arabia is expected to produce 1.2 mtpa of NH3 by the end of 2026. Ammonia is a high-value molecule. Countries such as Japan and South Korea - with limited renewable energy sources - break it down and use the hydrogen for their industrial net-zero targets.   104809079 Interest AreasEurope, struggling with food inflation since the Ukraine war, wants it to make fertiliser, a legacy use case. Today, farmers use the lion's share of the 175 million tonnes of ammonia produced annually but it comes at a high environmental cost due to carbon dioxide emissions. So for players like AM Green, the interest lies in ammonia as a carrier of three hydrogen atoms, but cleanly produced. Both as feedstock and fuel, hydrogen (H2) is the next big frontier. ET was the first to report on BP and Petronas being in the race to invest up to $2 billion in AM Green platform on May 26. A formal announcement is expected this week. Greenko's founders and Petronas spokespersons were not immediately available for comment.Such scaled ammonia facilities will also lead to 1 MTPA of green hydrogen produced through 7 GW of electrolysers that will split water into hydrogen and oxygen. A similar 7 GW of renewable energy along with 42 gigawatt hours of pumped storage facility will power those electrolysers round-the-clock to ensure firm, dependable and schedulable supply of green electricity. The renewable energy for AM Green's ammonia sites will come from at least four upcoming mega projects, including the Pinnapuram Integrated Renewable Energy Storage plant in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. Similar projects are lined up in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. One mtpa of green H2 is about a fifth of the country's 2030 target under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Greenko is looking to industrialise proven technologies like storage, electrolysers to build unsubsidised, low-cost green hydrogen at $3 per kg produced with round-the-clock renewable power,  said a Hong Kong-based energy consultant.  In the US, the IRA Bill gives $3 per kg subsidy. And as electrolyser, solar panel prices drop further, the hydrogen price will drop further. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani wants to sell green H2 at $1 within a decade.Decarbonisation exercisesThe clean energy will be supplied and the electrolysers will be manufactured by other arms of AM Green, which will act as an umbrella platform for all such large-scale decarbonisation exercises. For example, in March 2022 a partnership had been set up with Belgium-based John Cockerill to build a giga factory to make electrolysers. That partnership will be housed in AM Green and get scaled up to supply 6.5-7 GW electrolysers to the ammonia vertical.The green ammonia will be exported abroad and also supplied to local customers. AM Green already has offtake agreements with Uniper SE of Germany, Posco of South Korea and state-owned ONGC for green molecules from 2025. It has also signed an agreement with Keppel Infrastructure Holdings Pte of Singapore to explore building a factory together.From lubricants to renewables to rooftop solar and import of LPG, Petronas' India footprint is wide and growing. It acquired Amplus Energy Solutions, one of India's largest rooftop solar power producers, in 2019 for Rs 2,700 crore. With an eye on net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, this July, its wholly owned subsidiary Gentari, tied up with ReNew Energy for a 50:50 joint venture for 5 GW of renewable capacity in India. The collaboration follows Gentari's initial investment for a 49% equity stake in ReNew's 403 MW Peak Power project in May.",

        "articleBody": "Billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s Adani Group is seeking to raise as much as $4 billion to help develop manufacturing plants that would produce low-cost green hydrogen, according to people familiar with the matter.Adani New Industries Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd., will take the lead raising the money from domestic and international banks and is in early-stage talks with several lenders, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private.Representatives for Adani didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.France\u2019s TotalEnergies SE and Adani said in June they plan to invest $5 billion to produce green hydrogen and related products in India, as the world\u2019s third-largest polluting nation seeks to decarbonize. Gautam Adani has said in the past that 75% of the group\u2019s forecast capital expenditure will be in green businesses and his companies plan to invest $20 billion over the next decade in renewables, green component manufacturing and related infrastructure.Tycoons like Adani and his rival Mukesh Ambani are betting on green hydrogen as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to establish India\u2019s leadership in the transition toward cleaner technology.\u201cGreen hydrogen holds a strong promise for India\u2019s future energy self-reliance,\u201d Adani\u2019s website states. \u201cIt is not too difficult to imagine a scenario where green hydrogen at a price of less than $1/kg \u2014 coupled with the projected reduction in the cost of combined cycle hydrogen turbines and fuel cells \u2014 will not only allow the country to make a transition from fossil fuels, but also free India from the debilitating financial burden of energy imports.\u201dAdani New Industries will conduct the fresh capital raising independent of Total, the people said. One of the first projects that the money will be put toward is a 1 million metric tons per annum green hydrogen facility being built in Gujarat, they said. Production from that plant is expected to start in 2027.A successful project finance close would demonstrate the ports-to-power conglomerate is winning back the support of lenders after corporate fraud allegations levied in late January by Hindenburg Research. While Adani Group strongly denied the accusations, its bonds and shares plunged and most are yet to reach their prior peaks. A court-mandated probe by India\u2019s market regulator is underway to assess if the conglomerate violated any local securities laws.",

        "articleBody": "For the first time Australia's main electricity grid reached a share of over 70% for renewable energy this week, an achievement that showcases the rapid rise of solar and wind generation, but also highlights several challenges. Australia is a world leader in renewable electricity generation and has the world's highest penetration of rooftop solar systems per capita. At around 1.05 pm Australian Eastern Daylight Time on Oct. 24 the grid that supplies the five of the nation's six states was powered by 72.5% renewables, with solar and wind providing 70.9% and hydro the other 1.6%. That may sound like a remarkable achievement in a country that until recently was largely powered by coal, but it could have been even higher, possibly above 90%. The reason total generation from renewables didn't reach over 90% on Oct. 24 was that some renewables were curtailed, largely due to negative wholesale electricity prices, according to the website Renew Economy. The rising share of renewables illustrates a wider problem for Australia's grid, and those in other countries that are also seeking to transition away from fossil fuels. Australia generates excess solar during the middle of the day, which in turn forces the ageing fleet of coal-fired generators to ramp down, before they ramp up again as the sun sets and renewable generation slides. There are solutions to this, and all of them are variations on the theme that as the grid is fed by more and more variable renewables, you need fast-acting and variable back-ups. In Australia this role has fallen to natural gas-fired peaking plants, battery storage and hydropower. Natural gas, while cleaner than coal, still emits carbon and ultimately isn't a long-term solution if the goal is to reach net-zero electricity generation. Hydropower has limited scope in Australia, and plans to develop pumped storage solutions have been delayed, or face massive cost blowouts, which undermine their economic case. That leaves batteries, and Australia already has several utility-scale battery farms, using mainly lithium-ion units. These have the advantage of being rapid response and also able to help with frequency control on the grid. But they also have disadvantages, including they are costly, they don't last long and if there is a fire, they are difficult to extinguish. One of the lessons of the energy transition is that there is room for numerous different solutions and to meet the need for extended storage, it's possible that iron-flow batteries may be the answer. This is a type of redox-flow battery and typically consists of two tanks for a negative and positive electrode and pumps. They can operate for up to 25 years, require minimal maintenance and can work over a wide temperature range. JOURNEY STARTSIron-flow batteries were developed decades ago but have yet to be deployed as a grid-scale energy storage solution. However, Stanwell Corp, an electricity generator owned by the Queensland state government, has entered into an agreement with Energy Storage Industries Asia Pacific (ESI) to develop a 1 megawatt (MW)/10 megawatt-hour (MWh) pilot plant. This comes in the form of 20 12-metre (39 foot) batteries that will be installed at the Stanwell power station in the Queensland regional city of Rockhampton. The agreement, announced on Oct. 5, also gives Stanwell the right to purchase up to 200 MW of storage a year from 2026. The project plans to have a 150 MW battery in commercial operation by 2029. Iron-flow batteries can provide electricity for longer durations than typical lithium-ion alternatives, lasting up to 10 hours, meaning an 150 MW battery plant could power 50,000 homes overnight. ESI Managing Director Stuart Parry believes iron-flow batteries are an idea whose  time has come.  With the retirement of coal-fired generators over the coming decade, iron-flow batteries can fill in the gap, Parry told Reuters in an interview on Oct. 20.  There hasn't been a need for them up to now, you need to see large-scale generators drop off,  he said. Parry doesn't see iron-flow batteries replacing lithium-ion units, rather they are complementary with lithium batteries able to arbitrage power prices by acting rapidly, while iron-flow units are more likely to act as baseload firming for the grid when renewables tail off. Parry also says iron-flow batteries work out about a third cheaper than lithium ion units when looking at the cost on a MWh basis. They do have some disadvantages, namely being they are much larger than equivalent capacity lithium units, meaning they need space to be installed. They also are too large for residential use, although if regulations were amended it's possible they could work on a neighbourhood basis, or in remote towns unconnected to the main grid. On the surface, iron-flow batteries seem like a solid solution to how to run an electricity grid dominated by variable renewables. But to be deployed at scale they will need a supportive regulatory environment that will enable sufficient land, grid connections and economics that make sense to utilities.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Sterlite Power Transmission (SPTL), a privately held Vedanta Group company, is joining hands with Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, to create a $1-billion joint venture platform to tap the growing demand for power evacuation networks in the country on the back of the renewable energy boom, multiple people aware of the plans told ET.SPTL is currently in the process of demerging into two businesses. One part will house the infrastructure division that develops and operates power transmission assets on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis, typically in 30-year concessionaire agreements.The other business will house the domestic manufacturing business of cables, conductors and optical phase ground wires.  This is on a turnkey basis for third-party buyers such as state transmission utilities. This division has over 34,000 km of optical phase ground wires-based communication projects under live line condition completed, or under execution, with 108 critical corridors across 15 states.GIC will be deploying $500 million in the infrastructure business for a 49% stake. The investment will take place in tranches, with an initial $100 million and $400 million to come in over the next two to three years on a need-to-draw down basis. This will be linked to Sterlite Power winning transmission project tenders and planned capex.GIC's plan is to be the exclusive partner of Sterlite in India in the transmission segment to try and gain a larger share of the market, which has seen annual cumulative projects worth Rs 10,000-12,000 crore bid out every year during 2010-22, according to industry estimates.There is also a commitment to deploy capital even beyond the $500 million initially earmarked.Meanwhile, Sterlite Power will transfer four assets with an enterprise valuation of Rs 6,000 crore ($722.60 million) into this JV. Additionally, the company is expected to invest around Rs 1,700-Rs 2,500 crore (up to $300 million) in cash over a similar two to three year timeframe, as well as deploy its capabilities to maintain its 51% stake in the alliance.Two of the assets are in Rajasthan, and one each in Assam and Kashmir. Together, they cover 700 km, with three substations and a transmission capacity of 800-2000 MW. With these four seed assets, the plan is to aggressively bid and build more,  said one of the executives in the know, on the condition of anonymity as the talks are in private domain.  GIC is a permanent pool of capital and is very bullish on the Indian infrastructure story. SPTL has historically maintained 25% market share in concession projects and wants to gain a bigger toehold.  Transmission is a scale game, and the size and tenure of a patient capital provider like GIC is key,  said the official.  They have built similar platforms with Greenko in renewable energy and IRB in roads. So, this is familiar territory for them too.    104683836Raise Debt to Build BigBased on this $1-billion equity funding, the plan is to raise three to four times debt to fully capitalise the platform into a $4-billion scaled operation. The JV is aiming to win projects worth Rs 10,000 crore annually, which would need Rs 3,000 crore ($361 million approximately) of equity every year.SPTL - itself formed through a demerger from Sterlite Technologies Ltd in 2016 - is 75% owned by Vedanta's Anil Agarwal family, with the remaining quarter held by minority shareholders. Pratik Agarwal, managing director, is Anil Agarwal's nephew.An SPTL spokesperson declined to comment. Mails sent to GIC on Tuesday remained unanswered until the time of going to press.Both sides are believed to have signed the JV agreement a fortnight ago and are awaiting the mandatory regulatory, lender and customer approvals. Deutsche Bank is the adviser to the transaction.In September 2022, SPTL announced that it had withdrawn its draft red herring prospectus for a listing and deferred the plans due to unfavourable market conditions. While the GIC JV is unlikely to get listed, the product manufacturing business is likely to be listed in future said officials in the know.Larger PortfolioOutside of the JV, SPTL is also the sponsor of the first listed power sector infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) in India - the India Grid Trust (IndiGrid) that has a market value of Rs 9,400 crore ($1.2 billion).SPTL has transferred 11 assets to the InvIT over time, starting with just two. IndiGrid, backed by KKR, has also made independent acquisitions to grow, including the buyout of the operating solar portfolio of Virescent Renewable Energy Trust in May for a Rs 4,000-crore enterprise value. The cumulative asset base of IndiGrid is around $3 billion.Independently, SPTL also has a $1-billion JV with Australia's AMP Capital for a set of four transmission assets, but the venture has been capped at that number.Since March 2022, Pratik Agarwal has also launched Serentica, a renewables-focused independent power producer catering to commercial and industrial customers.Serentica, which has also received $650 million from KKR for a significant minority stake, has outlined a $3.2-billion capex plan. Phase one would entail supplying 1.6 GW of round-the-clock green power to Vedanta Group companies, which would require 4 GW of wind and solar assets to be developed. Of this 4 GW, 600 MW is getting commissioned in the second quarter of FY25 in Rajasthan and Karnataka.With the push toward greener energy - with plans to have 500 GW renewable energy by 2030 - industry officials believe 80% of new generation and transmission capacity will come up in Rajasthan and Gujarat. During 2023-30, the industry estimates an average annual tender bid-out of around Rs 45,000 crore.This pace in the electricity sector thus puts a huge premium on robust grids. As such, there would be a growing need for energy storage plants to smoothly integrate these renewable capacities in the grid and stabilise them.The Centre has released a transmission network plan for the integration of more than 500 GW of non-fossil capacity addition by 2030. The plan details the various transmission schemes that provide connectivity from renewable energy potential zones, implementation phases, financing needs as well as a 25-year waiver of inter-state transmission system charges for sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned by June 30, 2025.",

        "articleBody": "Tensions from the war in Gaza could help accelerate the move away from planet-warming fossil fuels like oil and gas and toward renewable energy, electric cars and heat pumps - similar to how sharp increases in the price of oil during the 1970s unleashed efforts to conserve fuel, the head of the International Energy Agency said.  Today we are again facing a crisis in the Middle East that could once again shock oil markets,  said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. That comes on top of the stress on energy markets from Russia's cutoff of natural gas to Europe over its invasion of Ukraine, he said.  Put these two things together, and no one can convince me that oil and gas are safe and secure energy choices for countries or consumers,  Birol told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the publication Tuesday of the IEA's annual world energy outlook, which analyzes the global picture of energy supply and demand.   This could further accelerate the energy transition around the world,  with renewable sources like wind or solar offering a  long lasting solution  to energy security issues as well as climate change, he said. The attack on Israel by the militant organization Hamas and the ensuing Israel military operations have raised fears of a wider Mideast conflict. So far oil price rises have been relatively moderate. International benchmark Brent crude traded at $90.17 per barrel Tuesday, up from around $84 on the eve of the Hamas attack. So far the fighting has not led to a supply interruption. Fossil fuel prices are down from 2022 peaks, but  markets are tense and volatile,  said the IEA in the report.  Some of the immediate pressures from the global energy crisis have eased, but energy markets, geopolitics, and the global economy are unsettled and the risk of further disruption is ever present,  it said.  Birol pointed out that there was  a major government response  to the energy supply concerns that arose 50 years ago from the Arab oil embargo imposed during the 1973 Yom Kippur war.  It sent oil prices nearly 300% higher and led to the founding of the IEA in 1974 to help shape a collective response to the disruption. That was followed by the 1978 Iranian revolution, which added another price shock. At the time, the solutions included the rollout of nuclear power plants and the imposition of mileage standards for cars.  This time, we have all of the available technologies,  Birol said.  We have solar, wind, nuclear power, electric cars. They will extend significantly around the world and it will be an additional boost to the energy transition.  He pointed to the rapid rollout of electric cars, saying that in 2020 only one in 25 cars was electric but in 2023 it was one in five. Meanwhile the share of fossil fuels in electricity generation has fallen from 70% ten years ago to 60% today and should reach 40% by 2030, he said.  Concerted international action at the upcoming United Nations climate conference is needed to expand use of clean technologies and find new ways of financing the massive investment that is needed, especially in the developing world, the IEA said.  The report also pointed to a shifting role for China, once a leading source of increased demand for energy due to rapid industrialization and growth. The report said energy demand there could peak as soon as 2025 amid slowing growth and  impressive  shifts to clean energy like solar and nuclear. The IEA estimates that demand for fossil fuels will peak before 2030 under current policies but says governments will have to increase their efforts to speed up the transition if the world is to meet the global goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).",

The minister for power, new and renewable energy made the remarks during a meeting with the green hydrogen developers on October 19, an official statement said on Friday.  With our single unified grid and large renewable capacity, India can produce the cheapest green hydrogen in the world. We will do everything in our power to make India competitive in producing green hydrogen and to achieve the targets set out in the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM),  the minister was quoted as saying in the MNRE statement. The meeting aimed to understand the issues faced by the developers and how the government can help overcome these issues like SEZ policies, regulatory provisions for enabling dual connectivity, certain contractual conditions, and demand charges being levied by states among others. A presentation at the meeting showed that for producing 1 million metric tonnes of hydrogen, 25 GW renewable energy is required while for producing 1 million metric tonnes of green ammonia, 5 GW renewable power is needed.  The industry representatives were requested to share the locations of their upcoming green Hydrogen/Ammonia plants and the corresponding withdrawal capacity required so that the required transmission infrastructure can be planned accordingly,  the statement said. The minister assured the industry the government will take all possible steps for the resolution of their issues at the earliest. The Union Cabinet on January 4 approved the mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore to make India a global hub for the manufacturing of this clean source of energy, and development of a production capacity of at least 5 MMT (Million Metric Tonnes) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.",

Under this collaboration, HEID, the subsidiary company of Japanese automobile giant Honda Motor, will provide OSM (Omega Seiki Mobility) swappable batteries for its EVs and set up a network of quick interchange stations in Tier-I cities pan-India, OSM said in a statement.  Honda's battery swap service enables auto rickshaw drivers to swap discharged batteries with fully-charged ones at strategically located battery stations, OSM said, adding that the technology significantly reduces initial EV purchase costs, alleviates concerns about range limitations, and minimizes downtime associated with battery recharging.   The swappable battery technology represents a paradigm shift, offering unparalleled efficiency and environmental advantages. It perfectly aligns with our vision of rapid, clean, and accessible electric transportation,  said Uday Narang, founder and Chairman of Omega Seiki Mobility.   In the next two years, we intend to implement Honda's swap technology in over 10,000 vehicles in both passenger and cargo segments,  he added.  OSM also said its upcoming EV three-wheelers -- both cargo and passenger ones -- will be equipped with Honda's intelligent swappable batteries utilising advanced lithium-ion technology.  HEID said it intends to develop an extensive battery swap network, initially in Bengaluru and expanding it to other Tier 1 cities.  The lithium-ion battery technology and know-how that Honda has cultivated over many years in the global four-wheeler market were concentrated in its swappable battery pack, said Tomohide Haraguchi, Vice President of Technology and OEM development at HEID.   We welcome our collaboration with Omega Seiki Mobility. This safe and reliable lithium-ion battery pack offering will surely accelerate the expansion of OSM's innovative electric vehicles,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "Stalled spending on electrical grids worldwide is slowing the rollout of renewable energy and could put efforts to limit climate change at risk if millions of miles of power lines are not added or refurbished in the next few years, the International Energy Agency said. The Paris-based organisation said in the report Tuesday that the capacity to connect to and transmit electricity is not keeping pace with the rapid growth of clean energy technologies such as solar and wind power, electric cars and heat pumps being deployed to move away from fossil fuels. IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told The Associated Press in an interview that there is a long line of renewable projects waiting for the green light to connect to the grid. The stalled projects could generate 1,500 gigawatts of power, or five times the amount of solar and wind capacity that was added worldwide last year, he said.  It's like you are manufacturing a very efficient, very speedy, very handsome car - but you forget to build the roads for it,  Birol said. If spending on grids stayed at current levels, the chance of holding the global increase in average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - the goal set by the 2015 Paris climate accords -  is going to be diminished substantially,  he said. The IEA assessment of electricity grids around the globe found that achieving the climate goals set by the world's governments would require adding or refurbishing 80 million kilometers (50 million miles) of power lines by 2040 - an amount equal to the existing global grid in less than two decades. Annual investment has been stagnant but needs to double to more than USD 600 billion a year by 2030, the agency said. It's not uncommon for a single high-voltage overhead power line to take five to 13 years to get approved through bureaucracy in advanced economies, while lead times are significantly shorter in China and India, according to the IEA. The report cited the South Link transmission project to carry wind power from northern to southern Germany. First planned in 2014, it was delayed after political opposition to an overhead line meant it was buried instead. Completion is expected in 2028 instead of 2022. Other important projects that have been held up: the 400-kilometer (250-mile) Bay of Biscay connector between Spain and France, now expected for 2028 instead of 2025, and the SunZia high-voltage line to bring wind power from New Mexico to Arizona and California. Construction started only last month after years of delays. On the East Coast, the Avangrid line to bring hydropower from Canada to New England was interrupted in 2021 following a referendum in Maine. A court overturned the statewide vote rejecting the project in April.",

        "articleBody": "Indian Oil Corporation, the nation's biggest oil firm, will invest Rs 1,660.15 crore as equity in a newly set up joint venture with energy major NTPC Ltd for setting up renewable power plants. In June, IOC and NTPC had formed a 50:50 joint venture company, IndianOil NTPC Green Energy Pvt Ltd, to set up renewable energy projects to meet round-the-clock power requirements of refineries of the oil company.  In a stock exchanging filing, IOC said its Board in a meeting on October 13,  has accorded approval to the investment plan of the joint venture company for setting up of renewable energy power plants and approved the equity contribution of up to Rs 1,660.15 crore towards Indian Oil's share of 50 per cent in the equity share capital of the JVC.   On June 2, IOC incorporated the joint venture company (JVC) with NTPC Green Energy Limited, (a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTPC Limited).   IndianQil NTPC Green Energy Private Limited will develop renewable energy-based power projects (viz. solar PV, wind, any other renewable energy, energy storage or any combination of the same), to meet the round-the-clock (RTC) power requirements of new projects of IndianQOil Refineries,  the firm had said at that time.  The aim is to generate a minimum capacity of 650 MW of round-the-clock renewable power to fulfill the energy requirements of IOC refineries.  NTPC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NGEL, has set an ambitious target of building a renewable generation portfolio of 60 GW over the next decade to aggressively pursue its green energy business.  In March, IOC had announced consolidation of its green assets under one umbrella for better synergy.  It is aiming to build a portfolio of 3 GW renewable energy and 0.6 million tonnes of biofuels by 2025.  The renewable energy portfolio is to be expanded to 35 GW by 2030, and 200 GW by 2050. Alongside, it plans to raise capacity to produce biofuels from agri and municipal waste to 7 million tonnes and biogas to 9 million tonnes by 2050.  Its renewable energy portfolio currently stands at 239 MW, which is being expanded through new wind, solar, hydel and pumped hydro projects. It is collaborating with NTPC to augment its renewable energy capacity by around 2.8 GW.  IOC is also solarising 20,705 petrol pumps with an installed capacity of 121 MW. Initiatives in EVs are being intensified by setting up 4,700 charging stations and 66 battery swapping stations.  It has collaborated with Israeli start up Phinergy for a battery joint venture.  IOC has also firmly etched its presence in the nascent green hydrogen ecosystem of the country. The company has a firmed-up collaboration with ReNew Power Private Limited (ReNew) and Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) for green hydrogen business.  A 7 kilo-tonnes per annum green hydrogen capacity is under development at the Panipat refinery.",

Talking to PTI, IBA Chairman Gaurav Kedia said  Indian Biogas Association (IBA), an industry association comprising operators, manufacturers, and planners of bioenergy plants, has received a commitment of investment worth Rs 2,755 crore during the Renewable Energy India Expo 2023.   The association has signed joint ventures (JVs), MoUs (memorandum of understanding) and received LoIs (letter of intent) commitments during the recently concluded Renewable Energy India (REI) Expo held at Greater Noida from from October 4 to 6.  The industry has made this promise, which is expected to be realised in the next three years, Kedia said.  Kedia informed that there was a huge interest from companies from various countries like Germany, Sweden and Italy.   We have signed several MoUs amounting to more than Rs 1,000 crore of JVs and could get an interest for an additional 54 LoIs for setting up of compressed biogas plants in the country...,  he stated.  The IBA is the first nationwide and professional biogas association for operators, manufacturers and planners of biogas plants, and representatives from public policy, science and research in India. The association was established in 2011 and revamped in 2015 to promote a greener future through biogas.  The IBA is working with many international organizations like the German Biogas Association to foster the development of the Bio-energy sector in India.  The Bio-energy pavilion was supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and several leading national and international industry players.  The expo is one of the largest trade expositions and events focusing on renewable energy (bio-energy, solar, and wind) and energy efficiency technologies, including electric vehicles and battery storage.  The objective of the exhibition is to accelerate India's pledge towards net zero emission.  IBA President A R Shukla said,  This year's REI expo was a huge success considering the announcement of the Global Biofuel Alliance by the G20 Nations. This has brought in a positive sentiment within the industry.   The sector has been demanding a nodal ministry or organization on the lines of the National Skills Development Organisation, from the government, considering there is huge potential to be self-sufficient in energy in the years to come, Shukla noted.  The Biogas industry can provide a solution that can help replace fossils completely, if the right kind of push is made towards the sector's development, Shukla said.",

        "articleBody": "Any specific country\u2019s dominance of critical minerals\u2019 global value chain isn\u2019t a matter of worry, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri has said.As the world transitions to renewable energy, the demand for critical minerals has risen, with debates raging around the control of supply chains. China has emerged as the dominant force with immense control over the global value chain, primarily due to the large processing capacity of minerals it has developed over the years.\u201cI wouldn't worry too much about these things. You're often told\u2026it can't be done because country X has already bought the next 20 years, 30 years of stock. It doesn't work like that,\u201d Puri said at an industry event in response to a query on his thinking over supply chain dominance by some countries.\u201cWhen I was posted as ambassador to Brazil in 2006, I was told, you know, you are about 10 years late, the one particular country\u2026has already bought off all the assets,\u201d he said, without naming any country. \u201cWe today have $4 billion of investment there. I don't think that particular country has anything like that. So, these things are not correct.\u201dThe US and European Union have launched major policy initiatives to diversify the global supply chain and loosen Chinese control over the critical mineral and renewable energy supply chains. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is the biggest ever capital incentive programme the US has launched to attract clean tech investments.Puri said Indian companies should aim to take advantage of the boost the IRA will bring to the green hydrogen business. \u201cIf green hydrogen production gets a boost, either through the Inflation Reduction Act or some action by the Europeans, \u2026 I would expect that Indian companies will also participate and take advantage of that boost that green hydrogen is going to get,\u201d he said.Puri said he favoured green hydrogen over blue hydrogen. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water leaving no emissions while blue is produced by reforming natural gas and capturing the carbon emissions produced in the process.A mandate to use green hydrogen will come but if it comes before an adequate supply is made available, it would only add to the cost for businesses, Puri said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India and Saudi Arabia on Sunday inked an initial pact to collaborate in the field of electrical interconnections, green/clean hydrogen and supply chains. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aims to establish a general framework for cooperation between the two countries in the field of electrical interconnection and exchange of electricity during peak times and emergencies.  Besides, both the countries aim for co-development of projects, co-production of green/clean hydrogen and renewable energy, and also establishing secure, reliable and resilient supply chains of materials used in green/clean hydrogen and the renewable energy sector.  According to a power ministry statement, India and Saudi Arabia signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Riyadh on Sunday.  The MoU was signed between the visiting Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy R K Singh and Minister of Energy, Government of Saudi Arabia, Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud on the sidelines of the MENA Climate Week in Riyadh, it stated.  It was also decided between the two energy ministers that B2B Business Summits and regular B2B interactions between the two countries will be conducted to establish complete supply and value chains in the above-mentioned areas of energy sector cooperation.  Earlier, an Indian delegation led by Singh participated in the high-level segment of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Climate Week 2023, which is being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during October 8 - 12, 2023.  The MENA Climate Week 2023, will discuss climate solutions ahead of COP28 and is being hosted by the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Addressing a session, Singh said that MENA Climate Week is extremely important in exploring and sharing opportunities to shape the future of energy production, consumption and sustainability on a global scale.  He said that the gathering at MENA CW holds great significance for the MENA region and collectively possesses immense potential in influencing the current and future narrative of energy transition.  Singh said green hydrogen is a promising alternative for accelerating India's energy transition.  ... the government of India has launched the National Green Hydrogen Mission for harnessing hydrogen energy and has approved an initial outlay of USD 2.3 billion for this Mission.   The Minister called upon MENA countries to join the Global Biofuel Alliance, in order to advance international cooperation in sustainable biofuels to realize the full potential of the Alliance.  He said that the Alliance aims to facilitate cooperation in intensifying the development and deployment of sustainable biofuels, to facilitate trade in biofuels and much more, in collaboration with international biofuels organizations.  The Minister underlined that India firmly believes that all nations must recognize that the energy transition will have different challenges and opportunities for developing countries and the global south in particular.  Singh asserted at the MENA Climate Week that individual actions and sustainable behavioural choices are crucial to achieve the energy transition in a sustainable manner.   In this regard, I call upon the MENA region to join India's initiative on Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE),  said the Minister.  The high-level GST (Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement) regional dialogue at the Middle-East and North Africa (MENA) Climate Week will further serve as a platform to discuss the challenges, barriers, solutions and opportunities for enhancing climate action and support within the context of MENA and for enhancing international cooperation.  The GST allows countries to periodically take stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement to assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of the Agreement and its long-term goals.  The first GST started in Glasgow in 2021 and will conclude at the climate change conference in Dubai, UAE (at COP 28).",

        "articleBody": "India recorded an estimated 988,000 renewable energy jobs in 2022, according to a recent report of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).As per the report, hydropower emerged as the top employer with 466,000 jobs, according to the data. Solar photovoltaic (PV) followed closely, engaging 282,000 individuals in both on-grid and off-grid systems.India's solar capacity witnessed a remarkable increase, with 13.5 GW of solar PV added in 2022, surpassing the previous year's 10.3 GW. Furthermore, India experienced a significant boost in its domestic solar module production capacity, soaring from 10.4 GW in 2021 to an impressive 24.7 GW in 2022. Despite this expansion, production rates did not match the increased capacity, with utilization dropping from 36% to 28%, as reported by Wood Mackenzie in 2023.Indian solar module exports saw an extraordinary surge in 2022, multiplying over five times. This surge can be attributed to the import restrictions imposed by the United States on Chinese products, as outlined in a 2023 report by Gulia and colleagues.IRENA's analysis highlighted a 47% increase in grid-connected solar PV jobs in India in 2022, totaling 201,400 positions, a substantial rise from the previous year. The off-grid solar segment also contributed significantly, employing 80,000 individuals. The fiscal year 2022 witnessed the creation of 52,100 new jobs in the solar industry, primarily in project development.Utility-scale solar projects experienced a boost, with an 83% increase in solar PV capacity, resulting in 72,700 jobs, up from 42,900 in 2021. Simultaneously, rooftop solar employment surged to 65,400 positions, a considerable jump from the previous year's 43,000 jobs.However, wind energy experienced a slower growth rate in 2022. India added a modest 1.9 GW to its wind capacity, a figure significantly lower than the peak installation of 4.1 GW in 2017, as noted by IRENA in 2023. The wind sector introduced only 600 new construction and installation jobs in 2022. Despite this slow growth, the sector holds immense potential, with India possessing an annual wind turbine generator manufacturing capacity of 10-12 GW, as per GWEC's 2023 report. IRENA's estimates indicate that the Indian wind sector provided 40,000 jobs in 2022, with operations and maintenance jobs constituting nearly half of this figure.",

        "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is set to disrupt India\u2019s fledgling market for electric vehicle chargers by launching its own range of EV chargers and removable batteries. The company expects that battery swapping will help reduce the upfront and operating costs of electric vehicles, crucial for its widespread adoption in India, one of the world\u2019s largest automobile markets.The Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate is looking to tap into the entire ecosystem of EVs ranging from cells and batteries to charging and battery swapping as it seeks to \u201cdemocratize EVs and make them more affordable,\u201d a company executive said requesting anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media.As part of the plan, RIL has developed a removable lithium-ion battery that can power an electric scooter, electric three-wheeler and a light commercial vehicle, besides lighting up homes during a power outage. The batteries can be changed at RIL's battery swapping stations or re-charged by households using rooftop solar panels, which it also plans to sell.104168144The company is demonstrating the integrated energy ecosystem --- the battery technology in an electric two-wheeler, swappable battery and charging station that is capable of charging the batteries using both solar power and electricity at the Renewable Energy India Expo, the two-day show that began in Delhi on Wednesday.This is the first time RIL is showcasing its own battery in an e-scooter designed and developed for the purpose and the way it will function in an integrated eco-system. It highlights how the company\u2019s ambitious $10 billon strategy for the New Energy business will pan out, said a person aware of the plans. RIL is in talks with multiple electric two-wheeler makers--mostly start-ups--who could be interested in adopting the removable battery for their upcoming EV models, the executive cited above stated.While the cheaper cost of solar energy at Rs5/kilowatt as compared to Rs12/kilowatt for electricity will make charging EVs cheaper, the removable batteries will ensure that EV users will no longer have to bear the upfront cost of batteries. Batteries account for as much as 40% of the cost of an EV.\u201cThe fundamental idea is to popularize battery as a service to ensure that the battery can be used for various vehicle categories \u2013 two wheelers, three wheelers and light commercial vehicles. Unless there is some degree of standardization, the swap stations will not be viable as the usage will be limited,\u201d said the RIL executive cited above.Users of swappable batteries will be able to buy a monthly subscription plan from RIL and manage the subscription from their Jio phones via an app.Almost one and half years after the government released the draft note on battery swapping to bring down upfront costs of EVs, the policy has been in a limbo amid stiff opposition from EV makers who say that standardization would unfairly benefit a particular manufacturer.\u201cToday, EVs are selling due to subsidy support. Once the subsidy is reduced further, sales will falter and survival will become a struggle for all the e-two-wheeler makers apart from the top four,\u201d the executive said, adding that this was the issue RIL is looking to address with its removable battery.To be sure, RIL has been working on building capabilities for its New Energy business. In 2021, it acquired UK's Faradion Ltd, a global battery technology company, for an enterprise value of $100 million. Faradion boasts of extensive IP portfolios covering several aspects of sodium-ion technology. RIL will use Faradion\u2019s state-of-the-art technology at its proposed fully integrated energy storage giga-factory as part of the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Giga Complex project at Jamnagar, Gujarat where it is investing Rs 75,000 crore with plans to double the investment going forward. The batteries of EVs that are available today have a lot of limitations in terms of technology and life. RIL's product will be a differentiator in technology and design. It has to do with the capacity, the drainage and the life of the battery. They are tying up on a large scale with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to further the reach,  said an industry official aware of the development.RIL MD and Chairman Mukesh Ambani said at the company's annual general meeting in August. that the company's current priority is to set up its battery giga factory by 2026. It will manufacture battery chemicals, cells, and packs, leading all the way up to containerized energy storage solutions, and will include a battery recycling facility to deliver a truly integrated ecosystem.",

        "articleBody": "In a move to expedite India's goal of becoming a significant player in the global hydrogen market, the Ministry of Shipping and Ports has identified three key ports\u2014Kandla, Paradip, and Tuticorin\u2014as focal points for the export of green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol within the next seven years, a TOI report stated.The primary objective now is to establish the essential infrastructure at these ports, facilitating the storage, handling, and bunkering of these eco-friendly fuels and their derivatives. India's ambitious target is to create a capacity for exporting approximately 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen and its derivatives annually by the year 2030.This strategic initiative aligns with the objectives outlined in the National Green Hydrogen Mission, which seeks to harness hydrogen's potential in various industrial sectors, including fertilizers and petrochemicals. Furthermore, hydrogen derivatives, as a low-carbon fuel alternative, have immense potential in transportation sectors like shipping, metro rail, and trains.Sources told TOI that the Odisha government is currently in the process of allocating land in the vicinity of Paradip Port to manufacturers specializing in green hydrogen and its derivatives. The port authority is also planning to develop shared infrastructure facilities for the green hydrogen project, including the dedicated handling of ammonia and its derivatives. To support these efforts, a grant of Rs 325 crore has been requested from the Ministry of Shipping.Meanwhile, the Deendayal Port Authority in Kandla has taken an innovative step by inviting global Expressions of Interest (EOI) to gauge the interest and participation of developers and market players in the production, storage, and sale of green hydrogen and green ammonia.In a similar vein, the VOCPA port in Tuticorin has allocated a substantial 500 acres of land for the establishment of a green hydrogen hub. Port authorities have submitted a proposal to the government, seeking grant and viability gap funding to facilitate the development of the necessary infrastructure.(The article was originally published in TOI)",

Brookfield, through the Brookfield Global Transition FundII (BGTF II), has committed to provide equity capital of up to $845 million (Rs7280 crore) towards the development and construction of the power projects, stated a press release.Axis Energy Ventures will contribute their existing development pipeline of wind and solar power projects which are spread across the country and at various stages of development. Since 2019, Brookfield and Axis Energy Ventures through their earlier joint venture have collaborated to develop over 1.8 GW of solar and wind assets.Under this new strategic partnership, both partners will leverage their expertise and resources to jointly provide curated energy solutions to various industry participants, including government entities, corporate customers, and emerging industries such as green hydrogen, it added.Brookfield has more than 16 GW of wind and solar assets in operation or in the development pipeline across India. Axis Energy group has a renewable development portfolio of over 10 GW across the country at various stages of implementation.\u201cBuilding on our successful collaboration, we are delighted to be partnering again with Axis Energy Ventures to develop high-quality renewable power projects with best-in-class capabilities,  said Nawal Saini, Managing Director at Brookfield. We foresee strong growth in India on the back of the Government\u2019s target of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030, and its stated objective of energy security.In April, Brookfield Global Transition Fund (BGTF) had committed $1 billion in Vineet Mittal led Avaada Group to fund its green hydrogen and green ammonia ventures in India. Brookfield Renewable had also invested $360 million in CleanMax, a Mumbai-based renewable energy company, through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund recently.Last year, Brookfield Asset Management had raised $15 billion for its Global Transition Fund. Brookfield is the single largest sponsor of the fund having deployed $2 billion itself.Governments and corporations around the world are under pressure to decarbonize either due to stakeholder, economic or regulatory pressure or penalties in some markets, Connor Teskey, managing partner and CEO-Renewable Power & Transition at Brookfield told ET in an exclusive interview last year.\u201cAnd there are some great businesses out there, great counterparties out there that need either an operating partner or a capital provider to help them reach those goals. And we are increasingly being reached out to be that counterparty, having a pool of capital to support those initiatives,\u201d Teskey said.\u201cThrough this new platform, we will together accelerate the development of renewable energy projects in India with a strong commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility,  said Kataru Ravi Kumar Reddy, Chairman and Managing Director of Axis Energy Group.Brookfield's energy arm -Brookfield Renewable Partners owns approximately 31 GW of installed renewable energy capacity and a development pipeline of approximately 134 GW of renewable power assets.According to the data released by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, India\u2019s green energy capacity reached 120.85 GW, till December 2022. Solar energy contributed for 52 per cent share in the total renewable energy segment, making it the major contributor followed by wind energy with 35 per cent, said the JMK Research report.According to the Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh, India will achieve its 500 GW renewable energy target before the 2030 deadline.",

Its' current portfolio in India is valued at $2.2 billion with investment in over 290 businesses. Last year, BII agreed to invest up to $250 million in automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd's new electric vehicle unit.  India has produced the best returns of any geography we have invested in,  said O'Donohoe, citing buoyant stock markets and a stable political environment in the country. The company has about 8.2 billion pounds ($9.98 billion) worth of assets through its investments in around 1,500 businesses in emerging economies across 65 countries. On total portfolio investment, the company got 5% in annual return over a rolling 7-year period, he said, declining to give detail on returns on Indian investments. He, however, said the Indian economy was going through a  good phase  compared with BII's investments in some African nations, where high debt, inflation and weakening currencies had impacted returns.

        "description": "Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C is still possible, but it has become more challenging, says the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA's updated report to the 2021 Net-Zero Roadmap states that meeting these goals will require tripling renewable energy capacities to 11,000 GW by 2030 and increasing annual investment in clean energy to $4.5 trillion by the early 2030s.

        "articleBody": "Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and restricting rise in global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C is still possible but tougher now, according to International Energy Agency (IEA).Meeting these goals will require tripling renewable energy capacities to 11,000 GW by 2030, increasing annual investment in clean energy from $1.8 trillion in 2023 to $4.5 trillion by the early 2030s, driving large portion of the investment to emerging and developing economies, the IEA said its updated report to the 2021 Net-Zero Roadmap. Ensuring investments in clean energy and infrastructure, driving investment flows beyond developed countries and China are among the many challenges to achieving the goal of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C globally.Yet, what presents the biggest impediment, according to the IEA chief Fatih Birol, is the \u201cgrowing geopolitical fragmentation\u201d. Speaking to ET, Birol described fraying international cooperation as the \u201cAchilles heel of reaching our global climate targets\u201d.\u201cWe also know that no country can address the impacts of climate change by itself. And I believe we must find a way to isolate global action for climate change from geopolitical tensions,\u201d said Birol, adding that he hoped the COP28 UAE presidency will provide the necessary cooperation.\u201cOf course, every country has different routes to reach their net-zero target but there is no route to reach global net zero without fair and effective international cooperation,\u201d he said. The IEA report lays out the criticality of international coordination and cooperation if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.  103970037 Stressing the importance of ensuring that the pathway to global net zero is equitable, the report states that by 2035, emissions need to decline by 80% in advanced economies and 60% in emerging markets and developing economies compared to the 2022 level. It will also require almost all countries to advance their targeted net-zero dates. With the differential timelines proposed in the report, the developed economies are leading the way in achieving net zero in 2045, followed by China in 2050 and the other emerging markets and developing economies after 2050. The call to step up climate action comes close on the heels of major emitters slowing down or diluting their efforts to cut down emissions. Last week, the UK backtracked on key elements of its climate plans such as deferring the ban on sale of petrol and diesel cars by five years to 2035, even as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that the country would meet its target of achieving net zero by 2050.Another major emitter, China has made it clear that it will not countenance any talk of phasing out fossil fuels. Increasing the clean energy deployment will require a quantum jump in annual investments in the space by the early 2030s and the main issue \u201cis whether or not the emerging countries will be able to finance the clean energy investments. This is in my view the fault line of the overall investment challenge,\u201d Birol said.The IEA chief said, \u201cWe are well aware of the difficulties that the emerging countries, including India, are facing when they are transforming their energy sectors, which is why we have suggested differential timelines for countries to achieve net zero.\u201d ",

We are evaluating exciting businesses in sectors such as bio-fuels, circular economy ... as part of the vision for the 2030 roadmap agreed between India and the UK,  Nick O'Donohoe, CEO of BII told Reuters on Tuesday. In India, BII invested over $300 million in climate finance last year in sectors such as renewable energy, electric mobility and sustainable agriculture. Its' current portfolio in India is valued at $2.2 billion with investment in over 290 businesses. Last year, BII agreed to invest up to $250 million in automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd's new electric vehicle unit.  India has produced the best returns of any geography we have invested in,  said O'Donohoe, citing buoyant stock markets and a stable political environment in the country. The company has about 8.2 billion pounds ($9.98 billion) worth of assets through its investments in around 1,500 businesses in emerging economies across 65 countries. On total portfolio investment, the company got 5% in annual return over a rolling 7-year period, he said, declining to give detail on returns on Indian investments. He, however, said the Indian economy was going through a  good phase  compared with BII's investments in some African nations, where high debt, inflation and weakening currencies had impacted returns. BII wants to invest in new entrepreneurs and companies that are struggling to raise funds for their emission-cutting projects, he said.",

Hydrogen is deemed as the fuel for future with immense potential in helping India meet it's decarbonisation targets and its global demand for hydrogen is expected to increase by four to seven times to 500-800 million tonnes by 2050,  Puri said at the launch. He said that the domestic demand is expected to increase by four times, from current 6 million tonnes at present to 25-28 MT by 2050. PSUs under the ministry shall be able to produce around 1 MMTPA of green hydrogen by 2030, Puri further informed. This green hydrogen powered bus is going to transform the face of city transport in the country. I shall be closely monitoring the project and wish you all the very best for successfully executing this project of national importance,  he said.The ministry has been accelerating its efforts by taking up pioneering initiatives to produce and utilise green hydrogen in the refineries.The Minister also informed that the projects are aggressively being pursued pertaining to hydrogen blending in natural gas pipelines, localisation of electrolyzer based technologies, promotion of bio-pathways for green hydrogen production.In the hydrogen buses, the fuel cell utilises hydrogen and air to generate electricity to power the bus and the only effluent from the bus is water and the fuel cells are highly efficient as compared to IC engines, Puri explained.Unlike the conventional buses that run on diesel and petrol, these are possibly the most environmentally friendly mode of transportation.When compared to thermal efficiency of conventional IC engines which is 25 per cent, the electrical efficiency of fuel cells is 55-60 per cent.Puri said that these buses will have a high fuel economy of 12 km/kg of hydrogen as compared to 2.5-3 km/litre of diesel buses.Moreover, the hydrogen fuel-powered vehicle can be refilled in a few minutes.

        "articleBody": "It looks like big global investors can't get enough of Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), India's largest renewable power producer.French giant TotalEnergies SE's $300 million investment in clean energy of the Adani group company has taken the total investments made in by global investors in India's largest renewable power producer to $1.63 billion or about Rs 14,000 crore, PTI reported on September 24 citing sources.Total announced last week that it would hold a 50% stake in the new JV firm, and Adani Green Energy would hold the rest. The JV will boast of a portfolio of 1,050 MW, including 300 MW of already operational capacity, 500 MW under construction and 250 MW under-development assets with a blend of solar and wind power, the report said.Total already has a 19.7 per cent stake in AGEL. It also has an equal joint venture with AGEL, called AGE23L that holds a portfolio of 2,353 MW.Total's $300 million investment is the first since the Hindenburg report in January put the spotlight on Adani Group's debt pile and alleged accounting fraud and stock manipulation by the company. Adani denied these allegations.According to the sources cited by PTI, AGEL is one company within the Adani Portfolio, which has attracted a range of investors over the past few months including repeat strategic investor Total, one of the largest emerging market funds GQG Capital Partners and one of the world's largest sovereign funds Qatar Investment Authority.Together, these three investors have put in $1.63 billion (close to Rs 14,000 crore) over the past few months, taking advantage of the attractive valuations post the short-seller report, data shows.GQG Partners has taken a 6.8 per cent stake in AGEL while QIA picked up 2.7 per cent. IHC International Holding Company has another 1.3 per cent stake.Explaining the rationale behind the investment flow, sources said India is now a leader in the renewable energy space, with many solar and wind projects in the pipeline. Adani is the largest renewable power producer in India, and with its strong execution ability and great track record, it is in a sweet spot.This has turned Adani into the India's largest solar power producer as also one of the lowest-cost renewables players in the world. Average portfolio tariff is as low as Rs 3.02 per unit as against average procurement price of the country of Rs 3.75 per unit.It already has a portfolio of 20.4 GW across operational, under-construction, awarded and acquired assets.Sources told PTI that the company has given a capex guidance of Rs 14,000 crore for this year for around 3 GW of projects. Next year, it is likely to do at least 5 GW, which would mean another Rs 23,000-24,000 crore.With its capacity target to reach 45 GW, it has the potential to deliver 6x growth from FY23 and FY30, the sources told the news agency.Around 40 GW worth resource assessment has already been completed \u2014 sites, geotechnical studies, sourcing equipment etc. With constantly upgrading technology, there are chances that there could be an upside surprise in terms of output, the sources added.Inputs from PTI",

        "articleBody": "By the end of 2023, China will control half the world's installed capacity of electrolysers for producing low-carbon hydrogen amid a slowdown in new projects due to inflation, according to an International Energy Agency report released Friday.  After a slow start, China has taken the lead on electrolyser deployment,  the IEA report on hydrogen said.China's installed electrolyser capacity has jumped significantly in recent years, and is expected to reach 1.2 gigawatts -- 50 percent of the global capacity -- after having accounted for just 10 percent of the global capacity in 2020. Electrolysers are devices used for the industrial separation of hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules, using electricity obtained through renewable energy sources such as solar, wind or nuclear.With the green energy transition underway, electrolysers are becoming essential to replace traditional methods of producing industrial hydrogen.These have relied on polluting methane gas in a process linked to the petrochemical industry which is inexpensive but results in greenhouse gas emissions.The production of low-carbon hydrogen could reach 38 million tonnes by 2030 as long as all projects that have been announced are implemented, the IEA said. But the IEA is concerned about rising equipment costs due to inflation which are  putting projects at risk and reducing the impact of government support for deployment .  Several projects have revised their initial cost estimates upwards by up to 50 percent,  it said. The agency is also concerned about the slow replacement of traditionally produced grey hydrogen for green hydrogen worldwide. Low emission hydrogen accounted for less than one percent of the world's demand in 2022, the agency said, meaning hydrogen use accounted for 900 million tonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions.  Low-emission hydrogen use is still far from what is needed to meet climate goals,  the report said, while calling for greater international cooperation to avoid market fragmentation.",

        "articleBody": "France's TotalEnergies is close to investing about $300 million in a new joint venture company with Adani Green Energy that will house around 1 GW of renewable energy projects, said people in the know.It will be an equally owned joint venture between the two companies and will hold a mix of solar and wind power assets, the people said. The assets will comprise 250 MW of operational capacity, 500 MW of under-construction facilities and 250 MW of planned projects.The development marks a shift in the French energy major's stance since it put on hold a $4 billion green hydrogen project with the Adani Group in February after Hindenburg Research published a report on the group. 103794818 50% of capital investment Hindenburg had accused the Adani Group of stock price manipulation of listed companies through offshore entities and undisclosed related party transactions. The Adani Group has denied all allegations.While TotalEnergies will put in a $300 million equity investment into the project, Adani Green will contribute with the renewable energy assets, the people said, requesting not to be identified as the matter is private. TotalEnergies will also contribute 50% to the capital investment required for the 750 MW of under-construction and upcoming assets.The discussions between the two companies have reached an advanced stage and the joint venture is likely to be announced in a few days, the people said.The Adani Group and TotalEnergies did not immediately respond to ET's queries sent on Tuesday evening.TotalEnergies has a 19.75% stake in Adani Green Energy and is the second largest shareholder after the promoters who hold about 56.27%. TotalEnergies and the Adani Group also have an existing listed joint venture, Adani Total Gas.Shares of Adani Green closed 0.16% lower at Rs 1,004.55 Monday on the BSE. Markets were closed Tuesday on account of Ganesh Chaturthi.The stock has lost over 45% since the beginning of the year, but has climbed nearly 130% since hitting a 52-week low of Rs 439.35 in late February after the Hindenburg report.In July, the renewable energies arm of the Adani Group said it will be raising Rs 12,300 crore from a public sale of shares to institutional investors.",

        "articleBody": "The share of fossil fuels in Rajasthan's energy mix hit record low levels at just 50 per cent from April to July, according to data released by global energy think-tank Ember. This is the first time that such low levels of fossil fuel reliance have been sustained for over a quarter of the year. During the January-July period, fossil fuels contributed to the production of 34 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, showing no growth (-1.6 per cent) when compared to the corresponding period in 2022. In contrast, solar and wind power generation experienced substantial growth, recording a 28 per cent year-on-year increase and generating a total of 27 TWh during the same period in 2023. It is worth noting that just two years ago, solar and wind power generation represented less than half of this year's output. When combined with other clean energy sources, including nuclear, hydro, and bio-energy, clean power generation in Rajasthan now equals fossil fuel generation in capacity, the data showed. From January to July, electricity generation in the desert state increased by 4.4 TWh compared to the same period in 2022. This growth was entirely driven by the expansion of solar and wind power generation. Consequently, the carbon emissions intensity associated with power production in Rajasthan for July 2023 stood at 422 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO2e/kWh), representing a 10 per cent reduction compared to July 2022, according to Ember. Rajasthan has actively promoted the deployment of solar and wind power fleets through the implementation of its Solar Energy Policy and Wind Hybrid Energy Policy. Also, the increasing demand for clean energy from neighbouring places such as Delhi has attracted substantial investments in Rajasthan, which has the highest solar potential across the country. From January to July, Rajasthan successfully added 1.7 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity and 0.5 GW of wind capacity. As of July, the state's combined solar and wind capacity reached 23 GW, constituting 20 per cent of India's total solar and wind capacity. This expansion has elevated Rajasthan's status as a leading supplier of clean electricity in the country. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel generation capacity, specifically coal and gas, remained unchanged since 2022. On a national scale, India continued to rely on fossil fuels for over 70 per cent of its electricity generation throughout 2023 up to July, consistent with its energy mix in 2022. Ember's Data Analyst Uni Lee said,  To limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, it is imperative that the world must triple renewable capacity by 2030.  The G20 countries have committed to meeting this goal under India's presidency, she said. The remarkable growth in renewables in Rajasthan demonstrates that it is possible. India can lead by example through successful delivery on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to reach 500 GW of non-fossil generation capacity, Lee said.",

        "articleBody": "Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor Company and Eicher Motors are among Indian automakers working on range of eco-friendly technologies, including biogas, flex-fuel and ethanol, to achieve the government\u2019s goal of clean mobility in line with the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) announced at the G20 Summit.While two-wheeler makers such as Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, and TVS are looking to commercially launch one model each running on flex fuel by October 2024, carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki are developing vehicles powered by biogas which would be carbon neutral.For passenger vehicles, the timelines for mass introduction of flex fuel vehicles have been set at April 2027 given the complex product mix and volume constraints.Vinod Aggarwal, president of industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) said there has been significant progress in biofuels and alternate fuels. \u201cThe industry has showcased flex fuel vehicles on pilot basis in both two wheelers and passenger cars. Now, with the formation of Global Biofuels Alliance at the recently concluded G20 Summit, bio fuels will get a further boost as the country works in close cooperation with leading bio fuel producing countries\u201d, Aggarwal said.103739377 There has already been noteworthy shift to CNG in the passenger vehicle, and light and medium duty commercial vehicle segments, Aggarwal said, adding \u201ca lot of work is happening in LNG fuel for long haul trucks\u201d. Additionally, work is on to accelerate electrification in the bus, two-wheeler, three-wheeler and passenger vehicle segment.Maruti Suzuki chairman R. C. Bhargava said in a country where car users have diverse slab of incomes and usage patterns, India has a range of possibilities for generating environmentally friendly sources of fuel for automobiles. Bhargava said the automaker \u201cwill develop powertrains that use all available technologies from hydrogen to electricity to ethanol and biogas\u201d.Maruti Suzuki is aiming to launch six electric vehicles across segments over the next seven years. The company has also sharpened its focus on CNG post the transition to BS VI emission norms in 2020, when it stopped production of diesel vehicles. CNG currently accounts for about a quarter of the company\u2019s sales. Maruti Suzuki is also on track to launch its first EV in the upcoming fiscal year.In the two-wheeler and commercial vehicle segments, Siddhartha Lal, managing director, Eicher Motors said the company is making \u201csignificant investments for decarbonisation\u201d at Royal Enfield and VE Commercial Vehicles.\u201cWe also see significant potential for incentivising dense public mobility such as high-capacity buses on dedicated bus lanes, and lighter footprint personal transport such as two-wheelers. These will go a long way to improve access and equity of mobility as we reduce emissions,\u201d Lal said.Meanwhile, TVS Motor managing director Sudarshan Venu said while the company has been investing in accelerating adoption of electrification in the two-wheeler space, efforts are on to become sustainable across the value chain. \u201cWhile electrification is of course at the core where we have been investing for more than 10 years and shaping the EV transition, sustainability for us is all encompassing, including our energy footprint, bio-diversity conservation in and around our premises, recyclability.\u201d Overall, TVS is looking at investing Rs 3,900 crore over the next 4-5 years to boost its green portfolio. Automakers' renewed commitment to green mobility comes close shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to boost the use of cleaner fuels. The alliance, with the US and Brazil as its founding members, is intended to accelerate global efforts to meet net zero emissions targets by facilitating trade in biofuels derived from sources including plant and animal waste.The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global production of sustainable biofuels would need to triple by 2030 to put the world's energy system on track towards net zero emissions by 2050.India is the world's third-biggest importer and consumer of oil. The country imports about 85% of its crude needs and is gradually building capacity to increase its biofuel output. The country is targeting becoming carbon neutral by 2070 and is expanding use of biofuel in the transport sector to meet this objective. It has advanced by five years the deadline for doubling nationwide ethanol blending in gasoline to 20% by 2025.",

That aspiration dovetails with India\u2019s ambitions to become a net-zero carbon nation by 2070 and curb its reliance on oil and coal.In 2019, Total spent $600 million to buy a 37.4% stake in Adani Gas Ltd., now called Adani Total Gas. In 2021, it bought a 20% stake in Adani Green as well as a 50% interest in some of Adani Green\u2019s solar farms in operation in a $2.5 billion deal that was among the largest foreign investments in India.The bet on Adani Green worked well for Total as its value soared to $10 billion in 2022 when Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne described the stake as \u201ca source of potential cash.\u201d The duo were looking to partner up and fund billions of dollars worth of green hydrogen development in India. However, when Hindenburg Research accused the Adani Group of \u201cbrazen\u201d market manipulation and accounting fraud earlier this year, Total put a plan to develop about $5 billion of green hydrogen projects with Adani Enterprises Ltd. on hold. The Adani Group strongly denied the allegations by the short-seller.Adani\u2019s stocks and bonds have recouped some losses since the short-seller report, particularly after the group received investment from GQG Partners, and an interim report from an Indian Supreme Court-appointed panel in May said it found no evidence of stock-price manipulation. Adani Enterprises, which incubates the tycoon\u2019s businesses, in the quarter through March reported that its profit doubled to 7.22 billion rupees ($87 million).Adani Green said in July that it plans to raise 123 billion rupees to bankroll expansion through selling shares to institutional investors.",

        "articleBody": "India and Saudi Arabia have signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation and investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, hydrogen, electricity, and grid interconnection.The pact also includes cooperation on petroleum, natural gas, strategic petroleum reserves and energy security, sources aware of the development said. Circular carbon economy and technologies like carbon capture, utilization and storage also found place in the agreement.The move comes right after the G20 New Delhi declaration, where a consensus was formed on various issues, including an effort for tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 and phasedown of unabated coal power. India\u2019s National Green Hydrogen Mission aims for at least 5 million metric tonnes of annual production capacity by 2030 through renewable energy sources, whereas Saudi Arabia\u2019s clean hydrogen is likely to be based on low carbon emission technologies.Partnership on localising sourcing material, products and services related to the energy sector, and supply chains and its technologies, were agreed on.The countries will strengthen the cooperation with energy companies, promote digital transformation, innovation, cyber-security, and artificial intelligence in the energy sector.As per India\u2019s green hydrogen mission, the country aims to be an export hub for the fuel. The mission envisages a total assistance of Rs 17,400 crore for green hydrogen and electrolyser manufacturing.However, the technologies for green hydrogen are still evolving and costly, which requires countries to collaborate and cooperate.India is committed to its green hydrogen mission and wants the world to partner in it, Power Minister RK Singh had said earlier.India's green hydrogen will be the \u201cleast cost\u201d hydrogen in the world, the minister had said.",

        "articleBody": "Biofuel alliance can generate opportunities worth USD 500 billion in the next three years for G20 countries, according to Indian Biogas Association (IBA). Biofuel alliance can be a win-win situation for G20 countries and the environment, IBA said.  According to a study by the IBA, the biofuel alliance can generate opportunities worth USD 500 billion in the next three years for G20 countries.  The findings of the study assume significance as India is currently hosting the G20 leaders' Summit in New Delhi.  Biogas can generate an opportunity of USD 200 billion, considering the least investment required, compared to other energy generation options and easy availability of raw materials, it stated.  Bioenergy/Biogas, in principle, has the potential to replace fossil fuels completely, especially to decarbonize the transport sector, it pointed out.  In 2016, the G20 adopted a voluntary action plan on renewable energy, which committed members to increase the share of renewable energy in their energy mix.  India significantly increased its share of renewable energy in the overall energy mix and grew at a CAGR of roughly 22 per cent in the last six years.  India has ramped-up solar energy 20-fold in the last decade. During this period, solar energy and wind energy roughly grew at a CAGR of 38 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.  It stated that an initial investment of USD 100 billion in financial support will be required to trigger the biofuel industry, five billion for each G20 partner in the next three years.  This anchor investment will have further multiplier effects on private investments and the production of biofuels, especially biogas. Creating a favorable regulatory environment in the G20 countries and sharing technological advancements will be key to the success of this biofuel alliance, it stated.  Promoting international cooperation through best practices followed across G20 nations will be key to the success of the biofuel alliance, it opined.  The transfer of machinery and equipment within G20 partners must be made easy for the success of the biofuel alliance.  This will help G20 nations reduce their dependence on fossil fuels; their overall import bill for non-fossil fuels can be reduced by billions of USD within the next three years, helping them meet Sustainable Development Goals, it stated.  Increased energy security, and creation of jobs for each country can be envisaged, it said, adding that improved air quality and a better environment can save billions in healthcare expenses.  The G20 is a powerful forum that can play a major role in promoting Bio energy.  As per Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, current biogas and CBG production in the country is 1151 MT per day, and with the push to the sector, even with conservative estimates, it can go up to 1750 MT per day by 2025 in the next few years.  So far as biomass availability is concerned, there is a tremendous availability of potent biomass in India, and harnessing all of these as the CBG plant's feedstocks shall lead to a whopping production capacity of 170,000 MT of CBG per day, good enough to replace one-third of the crude oil imports or three times the imported LNG, it stated.  The average cost for each biogas plant is USD 4.25 million, and with the government's target of 5,000 biogas plants, this is a huge opportunity of over USD 200 billion, it stated.",

Low-cost financingRecognising that developing countries need to be supported in their transitions to low carbon or low emissions, the members will work towards facilitating low-cost financing for them, said the declaration.\u201cConcessional financing is very important for developing countries especially in the context of large capex needs and stubbornly high global interest costs,\u201d De said.India\u2019s initiative, under its presidency, to establish the Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre steered by the International Solar Alliance got recognised.India's interestsAnother of India\u2019s push, the role of grid interconnections and regional and cross-border power systems integration was recognised by the grouping.The nations opting for civil nuclear energy agreed to collaborate on technologieslike small modular reactors. The G20 said it was important to maintain uninterrupted flows of energy from various sources, suppliers and routes. It emphasised on exploring more ways of energy security and market stability, including investments to meet the growing demand, in line with sustainable development and climate goals.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced the launch of Global Biofuel Alliance and invited other world leaders to join the initiative, during the first day of G20 Summit in New Delhi. India's proposal for setting up a Global Biofuels Alliance was on cards to help accelerate energy transition. The Global Biofuels Alliance, which the world's third biggest oil consumer wants to push during its G20 presidency, mirrors the International Solar Alliance (ISA) piloted by New Delhi and Paris in 2015 to bring clean and affordable solar energy within the reach of all. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told PTI in an exclusive interview that India's proposal for a global alliance on biofuels among members of the Group of 20 major economies will help accelerate sustainable biofuels deployment in support of the global energy transition. Such alliances are aimed at creating options for developing countries to advance their energy transitions,  he had said.  Biofuels are also important from the perspective of a circular economy. Markets, trade, technology, and policy - all aspects of international cooperation are crucial in creating such opportunities,  Modi had said. Biofuel is a renewable source of energy which is derived from biomass. India, which imports over 85 per cent of its crude oil needs, is gradually building capacity to produce fuel from items including crop stubble, plant waste and municipal solid waste. While India is on schedule to double the mixing of ethanol extracted from sugarcane and agriculture waste to 20 per cent with petrol by 2025, dozens of compressed biogas (CBG) plants are being set up. The Global Biofuels Alliance is aimed at facilitating cooperation and intensifying the use of sustainable biofuels, including in the transportation sector. Its focus is primarily on strengthening markets, facilitating global biofuel trade, developing concrete policy lesson-sharing and providing technical support for national biofuel programmes worldwide. Such an initiative is also aimed at helping India's transition to alternative fuels and cutting its import bill, as it seeks to achieve its net zero carbon emissions goal by 2070. On the other hand, the ISA aims to mobilise more than USD 1,000 billion of investment needed by 2030 for the massive deployment of solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global sustainable biofuel production would need to triple by 2030 to put the world's energy system on track towards net zero emissions by 2050. Liquid biofuels provided more than 4 per cent of the total transport energy supply in 2022.(With inputs from agencies)",

The shipping world will go green. Just give it 5-7 years or 10 years. We have to be prepared for it and emerge as the refueling destination for all the green ships,  Singh said at an event.  That's our ambition because India can provide green hydrogen, ammonia or methanol at the cheapest cost.  For this, the country needs to have its own pilot projects for green shipping, Singh added.Discussion with the shipping ministry on the matter is ongoing and the ministries will convene a meeting to push it further, he said.The minister said that the government will come out with a pilot project for green hydrogen and green ammonia storage for round the clock renewable energy.India has the potential to be one of the biggest manufacturers of green hydrogen in the world because of a huge ecosystem of renewable energy, Singh said.The pace of adding renewable energy in India is the fastest in the world and renewable energy costs the lowest, which will lead to the cheapest cost of producing green hydrogen, he said.While there is a debate of green or clean hydrogen, by and large the world is likely to follow green, Singh said.India defines its green hydrogen as that produced through renewable energy sources and does not include those manufactured through carbon capture or other technologies. There are also attempts at setting up trade barriers by various countries which we have to take cognizance of and contest against, Singh said.103405900",

The driest August in over a century led to a surge in power generation, with coal's share in power output rising to 66.7% - the highest in six years. Despite higher demand, power plants have reduced coal imports by 24% due to increased production by state-run Coal India. Analysts attribute the higher power use to farmers using more electricity for irrigation, intermittency of renewables, and increased cooling demand.

        "articleBody": "India has stepped up the use of coal to generate electricity in a bid to stop outages caused by lower hydroelectricity output, and as an increase in renewables is struggling to keep pace with record power demand. It is unusual for India's electricity use to spike in August, when temperatures are lower due to the annual monsoon that runs between June and September. Demand typically peaks in May, when Indians crank up air-conditioners to beat the heat, and industries operate without rain-related disruptions.  However, the driest August in more than a century has resulted in power generation surging to a record 162.7 billion kilowatt hours (units), a Reuters analysis of data from the federal grid operator Grid India showed. Coal's share in power output rose to 66.7% in August - the highest for the month in six years, according to a Reuters analysis of government data. Lower rainfall lead to the share of hydro power in overall output plunging to 14.8%, compared with 18.1% in the same period last year. The government has repeatedly defended the use of coal citing lower per capita emissions compared with richer nations, and rising renewable energy output. LOW IMPORTS Despite higher demand for coal, power plants have slashed imports by 24% to 17.85 million metric tons during the first four months of the fiscal year ending in March 2024, government data showed, due to a 10.7% increase in production by state-run Coal India. Lower imports by the world's second largest importer of the polluting fuel behind China have kept global thermal coal prices depressed in recent months. Analysts and industry officials attribute the higher power use to farmers using more electricity to irrigate fields due to insufficient rain, intermittency of renewables, and increased cooling demand with warmer-than-usual temperatures.   Given the already stressed supply situation, as poor monsoon in August resulted in high agricultural demand, the sudden fall of wind generation ... has further aggravated the situation,  power analytics firm EMA Solutions said in a LinkedIn post on Thursday. India's peak demand - the maximum capacity required during any time of the day - rose to a record 243.9 gigawatts (GW) on Aug. 31, the Grid India data showed, exceeding available capacity by 7.3 GW. Electricity supply fell short of demand by 780 million units in August, the data showed, marking the highest shortage since April 2022, when India faced its worst power cuts in six and a half years. Weather officials expect country-wide rainfall in September to be in line with the long-term average, possibly providing some respite to utility operators.  RENEWABLE CHALLENGECoal's share in output rose to 74.2% in the eight months that ended in August, the Grid India data showed, compared with 72.9% in the same period last year and on track for a third consecutive annual increase. The share of hydro fell from 10.9% to 9.2%. Overall power generation has risen by more than 108 billion units this year, dwarfing an increase of about 16 billion units in renewable generation. India failed to achieve a target to install 175 GW in renewable energy by 2022, and has since stated that it would try to boost non-fossil capacity - solar and wind energy, nuclear and hydro power, and bio-power - to 500 GW by 2030. Achieving that target would require over 43 GW more of non-fossil capacity every year, nearly three-times the average non-fossil capacity addition over the last two years to July.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Tata Steel plans to scale up the usage of hydrogen in the steel making process after the successful completion of the pilot project at its Jamshedpur plant, in Jharkhand, the company's CEO and MD T V Narendran said. In April 2023, Tata Steel commenced the first of its kind experiment injecting hydrogen gas using 40 per cent of the injection systems in E-blast furnace at its steel plant in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand.   It was very successful, we will scale it up, But eventually we need to have green hydrogen available in Eastern India that will determine how it can be used,  Narendran told PTI in reply to a question on the results of the trials.  However, he did not tell the quantum in which the company plans to increase the usage of hydrogen.  Injection of hydrogen in blast furnaces helps reduce consumption of coal leading to reduction in carbon footprint.   This is the first time in the world that such a large quantity of hydrogen gas is being continuously injected in a blast furnace,  he said.  Speaking on the company's operations in the Netherlands, Narendran said the business there is moving from coal to gas to hydrogen and the transition is important for that nation because Tata Steel Netherlands will become one of the biggest consumers of hydrogen there.  The industry leader further said hydrogen is a very important part of the solution in the steel industry's transitioning into a greener future because like coal it plays an important role not just as an energy source but as a reductant of emission in the steel making process.  Steel accounts for about 8 per cent of the carbon footprint in the world.",

        "articleBody": "In a major diversification plan, Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries are planning to set up pump storage projects (PSP) on huge tracts of decoaled (closed mines) lands at their disposal.According to highly placed sources, the plan to set up such projects in the first phase will be finalised in a month's time, as the central government is quite bullish over such projects.Part of the coal ministry's ambitious plans is to diversify towards alternate sources of energy and through these pump storage projects, it plans to utilise solar energy to develop hydro projects.The power ministry earlier this year had come out with guidelines for PSP initiative and the coal ministry plans to develop such projects based on them, sources informed further.Under it, the CIL and its subsidiaries will use their closed mines, which have water stored in them, to lift it through solar energy. It will set up reservoirs over such closed mines where the lifted water will be stored. During night time, it will use the water lifted through solar energy to generate hydro energy.  We have decoaled land where underground reservoirs of water are there, while we need to build over ground reservoirs on such mines. We are making plans towards this. In a month, the first phase plan will be ready for PSPs. We want to go for it in a big way,  a ministry source said.Under PSP, all coal mines, where coal has been evacuated and water is there, will be turned into reservoirs after studying their feasibility and we will make reservoirs above them too. We will pull up the underground water through solar energy and store them in the over ground reservoirs and during night time, generate hydro energy which will run the turbine, the source added. Though PSPs are common abroad, it is a novel concept for India as we are thinking on these lines for the first time. A consultant will be appointed by the coal ministry and the action plan will be ready in a month. It's a high priority area,  said an official.PSPs are called 'giant batteries,' and are an internationally accepted technology. It is conventionally used to stabilise the grid and maintain peak power. The ministry claims that this technology is a preferred choice with the rise of renewable energy.The PSPs comprise two water reservoirs connected through a tunnel or underground pipe at different heights. When there is more electricity production and less demand, these projects pump water from the downward reservoir to the upward reservoir. When more energy is needed, water is pushed from the uphill to the downhill via a turbine to produce the required power instantly.",

        "articleBody": "Power and renewable energy Minister RK Singh on Thursday said a proposal on mandating the use of green hydrogen for some industries may soon be sent for the cabinet's approval.Basically that (green hydrogen consumption) mandate fixation is in process, Singh said at an event.  Most ministries want a smaller mandate to start with. I want a larger mandate for obvious reasons,  he added.Discussions with the concerned ministries have taken place so that we can have the mandates in place, he said. The nascent green hydrogen industry in the country has been awaiting clarity on how the government will support domestic demand creation. Mandatory use of the fuel in sectors like fertilisers, steel and oil and gas, among others, is likely to play a crucial role in domestic consumption. Deliberations with various ministries have taken place and we have come across some figures which will go to the Cabinet, he said.The National Green Hydrogen Mission, being spearheaded by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, has so far taken care of the supply and manufacturing of green hydrogen and electrolysers, including financial incentives.The mission, launched in January, aims for at least 5 million metric tonnes of annual production capacity by 2030.",

        "articleBody": "The New and Renewable Energy Ministry will soon seek the Union Cabinet's approval for a mandate on the use of green hydrogen in different industries. As per the consumption mandate, various industries especially petroleum, steel and fertilizers, would be mandated to consume a certain proportion of green hydrogen.  At present, various industries use hydrogen produced mostly using energy from fossil fuel-based sources.   Basically that (green hydrogen consumption) mandate fixation is in process. By and large, we have had the discussions and we have come up with some figures, and we will go to the Cabinet soon,  Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said at the BNEF Summit here.   We have had discussions with the concerned ministries on this,  he said, adding that most ministries want the mandates to be small to start with,  but I want a larger mandate for obvious reasons .  The minister explained that the government amended the Energy Conservation Act, which gives power to the government to lay down mandates for changing the feedstock from fossil to non-fossil.   So I can mandate fertilizer, petroleum (industries) etc. For instance, I can ask fertilizer and petroleum (units) that you are using grey hydrogen or ammonia and a certain percentage of that has to be green from this year onwards. Gradually escalating it so that 100 per cent of that is green hydrogen,  he said.  At present the ministry is debating with stakeholders the issue of the proportion of green hydrogen for industries.  This assumes significance in view of the National Green Hydrogen Mission launched by the government earlier this year.  On 4th January 2023, the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore from FY24 to FY30. The overarching objective of the mission is to make India a global hub for production, usage and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives.  The mission is expected to reduce Rs 1 lakh crore worth of fossil fuel imports and nearly 50 million tonnes per annum of CO2 emissions by 2030.  Earlier speaking at the Summit, Director Essar Capital Prashant Ruia said that the government has taken a lot of initiatives to boost renewables in the country which includes production-linked incentives schemes, subsidies and other incentives.   But the challenge is price differential between fossil fuel-based energy and green energy which is more expensive. But this can be addressed with technology and innovation,  he said.  Director, Serentica Renewables Pratik Agarwal stated that Serentica is focusing on developing end-to-end customer solutions for C&I segment and decarbonising their power needs with true round-the-clock renewable energy, which is completely different from standalone wind and solar projects.   RTC (round the clock) projects demand a comprehensive approach. We are not just talking about capacity; it's all about ensuring a continuous energy supply. From designing and integrating diverse technologies to efficiently balancing the inherent variability of wind and solar sources brings unique challenges,  he said.  It is an exciting time for the industry and we are ready to play a vital role in shaping a sustainable and green-powered future, he added.  The minister also talked about unprecedented power demand growth of 21 per cent in the month of August saying that this is giving him stress but he likes the challenge.  Singh said,  Demand in this month (August) is 21 per cent more than the corresponding month last year. In July, the demand was more than 9 per cent than July last year. In April-June, the (power) demand grew by 7.8 per cent Y-o-Y.   The demand in FY23 was 6.3 per cent more than the demand in FY22 and the demand in FY22 was 6.7 per cent more than the demand in FY21, he informed.   If I (power) don't grow then the growth of the country will slow down. So, I have to grow and I am growing. I am adding capacities and I have to keep adding capacities,  he said.  He said that the maximum power demand has hit 2,34,000 MW (on August 17).",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: It is not true that India is not reducing coal-based power generation capacity in the energy mix, a senor government official said, adding that the country is targeting over 64 per cent of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2030. India has set the target of having 500GW of renewable energy by 2030. Coal-based power generation, however, ensures stable operation of the electricity transmission grid.   It is not true that we are not reducing coal. We are in the business of energy transition. But keeping in mind energy security and supply to each and every consumer, we have to provide electricity to all types of consumers including commercial, domestic and industrial,  Chairman, Central Electricity Authority, Ghanshyam Prasad said at the BCC&I Environment and Energy Conclave here.  India's power infrastructure is mostly dominated by coal (based generation) as it constitutes more than 50 per cent in terms of capacity. In terms of output, the share of fossil fuel-based energy is 70 to 74 per cent, he said.  According to the latest Central Electricity Authority data, India has about 423 GW of power generation capacity, which includes 206GW coal-based capacity and around 7 GW lignite based.  He pointed out that India is already at 45 per cent (of non-fossil fuel based capacity) and reaching 50 per cent (renewable energy in energy mix) is not a challenge, but the country is targeting somewhere around 64 per cent-plus (non-fossil fuel based capacity) by 2030.  The country has recorded its peak power demand at 234 GW on August 17, 2023. In December last year, the power ministry has estimated the peak demand of 229 GW during this summer.  The ministry has made it mandatory for plants using imported coal to run at full capacity and also asked domestic coal-based plants to import the dry fuel for blending to avoid shortage in view of high power demand.  The official highlighted the importance of storage of solar and wind energy and suggested looking at pumped hydro storage projects as an alternative in view of the higher cost of battery storage.   We have 4,700 MW hydro pumped storage capacity in the country out of which 1,200 MW to 1,300 MW is not operating. We need 40 GW in this pumped storage hydro (space),  he added.",

ET first reported on April 26 that several global investors including APG had evinced preliminary interest in investing in the Mahindra InvIT. Mahindra Susten's businesses include the Mahindra Group's renewable-focussed engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) unit (with more than 4 GW of capacity constructed) as well as an independent power production (IPP) unit with around 1.54 GW of operational solar plants. The entire 1.54 GW will be transferred to the InvIT. The portfolio has an enterprise value of about $1 billion, the sources said. APG, IFC and AIIB are currently conducting due diligence on the assets that are part of the InvIT,  said one of the persons.  The deal is likely to close in the next two to three months.     102922016 Local Investors may Chip in Later  It will include a mix of primary and secondary share sale for a minority stake of around 35% in the InvIT,  the person said.Bringing a new investor on board will also help the InvIT move toward meeting norms that require an InvIT to have a minimum five shareholders, said one of the persons. Susten will later on bring in a few domestic investors such as mutual funds or family offices with small cheques to meet the minimum shareholder requirements,  the person said.Currently, Canadian fund Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (OTPP) owns about 30% stake of Mahindra Susten, acquired in September 2022 for \u20b92,371 crore ($300 million). OTPP will end up holding a stake in the InvIT too, along with the holding in Mahindra Susten.The Mahindra Group and AIIB didn't respond to queries. APG and IFC declined to comment.Axis Capital, Kotak Investment Bank and Avendus Capital are advising Mahindra Susten on the transaction.",

In a significant move for the progress of the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the government has notified the Green Hydrogen Standard for India, the New and Renewable Energy Ministry said in a statement. The standards issued by the ministry outline the emission thresholds that must be met in order for hydrogen produced to be classified as 'Green', i.e., from renewable sources. The scope of the definition encompasses both electrolysis-based and biomass-based hydrogen production methods, it stated. After discussions with multiple stakeholders, the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy has decided to define Green Hydrogen as having a well-to-gate emission (i.e., including water treatment, electrolysis, gas purification, drying and compression of hydrogen) of not more than 2 kg CO2 equivalent / kg H2. The notification specifies that a detailed methodology for measurement, reporting, monitoring, on-site verification, and certification of green hydrogen and its derivatives shall be specified by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy. The notification also specifies that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) under the Ministry of Power shall be the Nodal Authority for accreditation of agencies for the monitoring, verification and certification for Green Hydrogen production projects. The notification of the Green Hydrogen Standard brings a lot of clarity to the Green Hydrogen community in India and was widely awaited, it stated. With this notification, India becomes one of the first few countries in the world to announce a definition of Green Hydrogen.",

        "articleBody": "To transform into a low-carbon energy player, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is investing Rs 1 lakh crore by the end of this decade, PTI quoted the company. Investments will be made in low-carbon energy opportunities, including renewables and green hydrogen. State-owned crude oil and natural gas producer said in a statement that it has detailed a  roadmap to scale up its low-carbon energy portfolio significantly .   ONGC has aligned itself with India's ambitious goals and is wholeheartedly contributing to the nation's aim to curtail carbon emissions by 1 billion tonne and simultaneously reduce carbon intensity by 45 per cent by 2030,  PTI quoted ONGC.  Adoption of various de-carbonization levers, over the years, has resulted in significant emission reductions.  Integrating sustainable practices into core operations has enabled a reduction in Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions by 17 per cent in the last five years. ONGC has reduced its emissions by 2.66 per cent in FY23 (April 2022 to March 2023 fiscal year).   ONGC plans to significantly increase its spending on green initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint as a broader effort to achieve net-zero for Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions by 2038,  the statement said.  India's largest gas and crude oil producer is also in advanced stage talks to collaborate with leading players in the energy space on various low-carbon energy opportunities including renewables, green hydrogen, green ammonia among others.  It is also planning to set up two green-field O2C plants in India, according to the statement. However, no details were provided.  It is also  charting a roadmap for opportunities in renewable energy and low-carbon sectors. ONGC is investing around Rs 1 lakh crore by the end of this decade, on its multiple green initiatives and is planning to scale up its renewable portfolio to 10 GW by 2030.   ONGC is also actively exploring collaborations with leading players to leverage various low-carbon energy opportunities including renewables, green hydrogen, green ammonia and other derivatives of green hydrogen.  Also, the focus is on research and development in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies to mitigate emissions from existing processes.   However, oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) will remain the cornerstone of its energy business. Extensive exploration in known basins as well as frontier plays, sustained production from existing fields and exploitation of deep-water fields remain the central areas of emphasis,  the statement said.  In recent years, ONGC has persistently pushed the frontiers of exploration, expanding its boundaries.  Under its 'Future Exploration Strategy', ONGC has set up an ambitious target to bring 5 lakh square kilometers area under active exploration by acquiring one lakh square km every year, spending Rs 10,000 crore annually on exploration by 2025.   ONGC is dynamically evolving to meet changing realities. While maintaining our immediate focus on exploration and production, we are also crafting a future-ready ONGC that exemplifies resilience, agility, and adaptability. With each step forward, its discourse and actions will align more with that of an 'energy' company rather than solely an oil and gas explorer and producer,  the statement added.(With inputs from PTI)",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s Gautam Adani is prepared to go it alone in spending billions of dollars on developing green hydrogen in India, after TotalEnergies SE put a plan to partner in the venture on hold.The French energy giant had agreed to buy a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Ltd. for an undisclosed sum to help fund green hydrogen projects in India, as the world\u2019s third-largest polluter seeks to decarbonize. But Total suspended its investment in February, pending investigation of a short seller\u2019s allegations of fraud at the Adani Group, charges that the conglomerate has denied.Adani\u2019s first green hydrogen venture is a $5 billion integrated facility that will also include manufacturing plants for wind turbines and solar modules and renewable generation capacity. The project is a starting point for the group\u2019s longer term plan to invest more than $50 billion through the end of the decade in developing the fuel. Building the facility isn\u2019t dependent on Total\u2019s equity, Jugeshinder Singh, chief financial officer at the billionaire\u2019s flagship firm, Adani Enterprises Ltd., told investors last week, according to a transcript posted on the company\u2019s website. \u201cWe are going ahead with the project as it is and at the same pace.\u201d Renewed ConfidenceSingh\u2019s comments could signal that the group is winning back support from investors and lenders after months of turmoil following the short seller\u2019s charges. Tycoons like Adani and his rival Mukesh Ambani are betting on green hydrogen as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to establish India\u2019s leadership in the new technology, which is being eyed as a replacement for fossil fuels across a variety of industries, from steel to oil refining and fertilizers. The nation aims to produce 5 million tons a year by 2030, and has set its sights on both the export market as well as an expanding domestic demand. Total has already made four investments in Adani firms and Singh said the memorandum of understanding on hydrogen still holds. \u201cIf they express an interest in the fifth investment, we will naturally say, sure, no problems,\u201d he said. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a joint investment decision, he added.Adani Enterprises will invest about $300 million in the hydrogen business in the year through March and this will start to rise rapidly from next year, Singh said. Overall, the company plans $3.7 billion in capital investment during the year, he said.",

We will invest around \u20b9500 crore in making electrolysers. Also, we have a JV with IOCL and Renew to put up green hydrogen plants. Now that JV can also put up green hydrogen plants beyond IOCL for others, said Subrahmanyan, adding that the investment would be around $4 billion.   Between the three companies there will be sufficient cash available. L&T will fund this through internal accruals. We may need additional land around the port to transport green hydrogen and ammonia for which we are in talks with state governments,  added Subrahmanyan.This January, L&T signed an agreement with the Norway-based H2Carrier to develop floating green ammonia projects for industrial-scale applications. In March the company entered into an electrolyser manufacturing binding agreement with McPhy Energy, a France-based leading electrolyser technology and manufacturing company. Under this partnership, McPhy will grant an exclusive license of its pressurised alkaline electrolyser technology to L&T for manufacturing of electrolysers, including future product upgrades. L&T is setting up one Gigawatt-scale manufacturing facility for electrolysers based on McPhy technology in India to serve the domestic requirements as well as cater to the other selected geographies.The company has also set up a four-member think-tank-- L&T Green Energy Council-- comprising global leaders to bolster its commitment to carbon neutrality by 2040 and will be responsible for identifying technology trends in green energy among others.To buy NPCIL's 26% stake in JVSubrahmanyan added that L&T has proposed to buy a 26% stake held by its joint venture partner Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) in L&T Special Steels and Heavy Forgings, a joint venture between L&T and NPCIL.",

His remarks come against the backdrop of strong operational performance of all the three business verticals comprising commercial vehicles, domestic passenger and electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover delivering on their strategies in FY23. Tata Motors Group sales rose 23% to 13.36 lakh units in FY23 while its revenues rose to an all time high `3.46 lakh crore (up 24%), EBITDA improved to `37,011 crore (up 110 bps) and PAT was `2,690 crore. All three core auto businesses turned profitable in the second half of the year. Free cash flow (automotive) for the year stood at `7,800 crore improving substantially from a negative `9,500 crore recorded in FY22. As a result, the company\u2019s net automotive debt reduced to `43,600 crore from `48,700 crore in the beginning of FY23. The India business, he said, returned to profit after navigating all the challenges of FY23 with a profit after tax (PAT) of `2,728 crore. Tata Motors\u2019 Board has recommended a final dividend of `2 per ordinary share and `2.10 per \u2018A\u2019 ordinary share of face value of `2 each to its shareholders, subject to shareholder\u2019s approval. 102547150The company\u2019s passenger vehicle and EV business continued its robust performance for the third year in succession in FY23. The business registered its highest ever annual sales of around 5,41,000 vehicles in FY23, a growth of 45% over FY22. It became only the third carmaker in India to cross the 5,00,000 annual sales mark. The CV business witnessed a challenging first half in FY23 and refined its operating model to drive \u2018Profitable Growth\u2019. It moved away from \u2018supply chain push\u2019 to a \u2018demand pull\u2019 model, he noted.JLR made good progress in its \u2018Reimagine\u2019 journey to transform into a modern luxury vehicle business with sustainability at its core. The transformation of Jaguar into an all-electric luxury brand is on track with the first new vehicle expected to be launched in 2024 and customer deliveries starting in 2025. It will also start taking pre-orders for the maiden pure electric Range Rover later this year, he said.",

This unique platform infrastructure financing framework that funds various under-construction assets, offers project access to funds that another project in the portfolio has paid back,  AESL said in a press statement on Monday.It said such an effective one-time structure ensures continuous and consistent access to capital for all future projects in the company's transmission portfolio.102511544The banking consortium for the platform infrastructure financing framework comprised nine international banks - DBS Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., Mizuho Bank, MUFG Bank, Siemens Bank GmbH, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation. This link is the need of the hour for the city and will support its growth aspirations. It showcases our commitment to offering Mumbai a brighter and greener future. The project will help accelerate the city's decarbonisation and its net zero journey,  said Anil Sardana, managing director, AESL.Mumbai's electricity demand is expected to increase to 5,000 MW by 2024-25 from the current peak demand of 4,000 MW. The island city has only 1,800 MW of embedded generation capacity and the existing transmission corridors face capacity constraint risks.On October 12, 2020, the entire city witnessed a major power blackout event due to the grid constraints. The HVDC transmission link will enhance grid stability by providing an interface with the state and national grids. The link will bulk inject an additional 1,000 MW of renewable power into the city, thus ensuring uninterrupted power supply in future. Adani Electricity Mumbai has committed to increasing share of renewable energy in the overall mix to 60% by 2027. The HVDC transmission technology is superior to other conventional technologies as it stabilises power distribution networks where sudden new loads or blackouts in one part of the network may lead to synchronisation problems. It is the only technology suitable for islands where submarine cables are used for procuring power supply. ",

A switch to cleaner energy sources is key to our decarbonisation strategy. We are making significant strides in establishing a world class solar energy value chain...Our goal is to provide affordable green hydrogen as a viable alternative to traditional fuels,  Ambani said in his address to shareholders.Reliance is among the largest global producers of grey hydrogen. The company has partnered with Denmark\u2019s Stiesdal A/S to reduce costs and commercialise their Pressurised Alkaline Electrolyser technology. This will pave the way for rapid decarbonisation and commercialisation of affordable Green Hydrogen \u2013 a key enabler in achieving India\u2019s green energy transition,  Ambani added.Reliance will hold its annual shareholders\u2019 meeting on Aug. 28.During the year, RIL produced its first ever green hydrogen with firing of torrefied biomass in gasifiers. Biomass firing at its petrochemical sites increased to 11% of total feed in line with the company's decarbonisation efforts, the company said in its annual report.ET on 3 August reported that RIL is laying down infrastructure for disbursement of green hydrogen from its proposed plant in Gujarat as it prepares to begin production of the fuel by 2025. The company has received 74,750 hectare of land parcel in Gujarat on a 40-year lease for its green hydrogen project.Ambani, who is serving on the Advisory Committee of COP 28 UAE, said the development of giga factories at the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex at Jamnagar is progressing rapidly. Considering the collective potential of our five giga factories, we are well on track for establishing a world class, self-sufficient green energy ecosystem. RIL aims to establish and enable 100GW of solar energy by 2030. Ambani said RIL recognises the urgency of addressing the issues emanating from climate change and believes the company's new energy initiatives will contribute to the global effort of limiting the rise in average temperatures.The company said it is also in talks with other leading electrolyser technology players globally to establish a Giga-scale electrolyser manufacturing facility in Jamnagar.  Reliance will leverage its complementary skills in engineering, operations, seawater desalination, digital twin expertise, and indigenous balance of plants to complement its partner\u2019s technological innovation in stack manufacturing, enabling the delivery of Green Hydrogen at the lowest cost. Jio Financial Services to provide simple, affordable solutionsDays after demerging Jio Financial Services (JFSL) , Ambani said JFSL aims to provide  simple, affordable and innovative digital-first solutions . RIL demerged its financial services company Reliance Strategic Investments Ltd, and renamed it Jio Financial Services Limited (JFSL) last month.Jio Financial, has been valued at around $20 billion after its shares were spun off last month. As various financial services are governed by different regulatory frameworks, we believe, an independent financial services entity will allow us to access the opportunities available in the Indian market,  Ambani said adding that JFSL along with its subsidiaries will leverage the technological capabilities of Reliance and digitally deliver financial services for Indian citizens. Jio Financial Services aims to provide simple, affordable and innovative digital first solutions.  The digital revolution has penetrated every corner of the nation through Jan Dhan Accounts, digital payments, usage of smart phones and low cost data. The growth opportunities presented by financial services are remarkable and provide strong directional support to the economy. Last month, BlackRock Inc, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, joined hands with JFSL to create an equal joint venture for an asset management business. BlackRock handles about $11 trillion or 7% of all global financial assets.Both sides have negotiated to invest $150 million each to start the venture. The joint venture will be called Jio Blackrock and will launch operations after regulatory and statutory approvals. The company will have its own management team.",

        "articleBody": "The government is exploring options to address the issue of non-availability of feedstock like broken rice and maize that is being faced by ethanol manufacturers, Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra said on Friday.  The distilleries are facing an issue due to non-availability of rice. They have told prices of maize and broken rice are ruling high. This issue is actually under our consideration. We are aware of the problem. Very shortly, we will take a suitable decision,  he told reporters. Last month, state-run Food Corporation of India stopped the supply of rice from its depots to ethanol makers. On industry body ISMA's demand for a hike in ethanol price to Rs 69.85 per litre, Chopra said a committee is deliberating this issue.  Whether the government will consider raising ethanol prices in the last month of this ethanol year (December-November). That is something that the government will take a call. No decision has been taken yet,  he added. The Secretary also mentioned that the share of grain-based ethanol has gradually increased in the last 2-3 years. It stood at 17 per cent in 2021-22. In the current year, it has already crossed 17 per cent. The ethanol blending with petrol has reached 11.7 per cent so far and is hopeful of achieving the target of 12 per cent this year, he said. He also said that the government is looking at the shortage of grains for ethanol making. As a result, the government is now encouraging maize. Maize is used as an input for ethanol production globally. It was not happening in India somehow. The plan is to increase maize production in the next three years so that more maize is available for ethanol making, he added.",

        "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) is laying down infrastructure for disbursement of green hydrogen from its proposed plant in Gujarat as it prepares to begin production of the fuel by 2025, three officials aware of the development said. The company, which has received 74,750 hectares of land parcel in Gujarat on a 40-year lease for its green hydrogen project, is tying up with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for supply of green hydrogen and laying the groundwork to retail the same through its Jio-BP outlets, they said.\u201cRIL is setting up a green hydrogen dispensation infrastructure,\u201d an industry official said on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe company is targeting production of green hydrogen by 2025 and when that happens, it needs a ready infrastructure for offtake of that green hydrogen. There will be more such measures from RIL going forward, . RIL did not respond to an email sent on Tuesday till press time on Wednesday.The Mukesh Ambani-led company is investing $10 billion in capex for building its new energy ecosystem. Over the past seven months, it has tied up with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to supply green hydrogen.This February, RIL and Ashok Leyland unveiled India\u2019s first hydrogen internal combustion engine (H2ICE) technology solution for heavy-duty trucks.Later that month, RIL with Olectra Greentech, a subsidiary of Megha Engineering and Infrastructures (MEIL), unveiled a hydrogen bus. Olectra Greentech aims at commercially launching these buses within a year.In July, RIL collaborated with Bharat Benz for India's first intercity luxury concept coach powered by hydrogen fuel cell technology.    102364732H2ICE is a combustion engine that uses hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and diesel fuel. The advantage with this engine is that there is no need to make changes to the power train, or the assembly of every component that thrusts your vehicle into motion. So, the existing power train can be used with minor modifications to convert vehicles to a hydrogen vehicle.All these vehicles, RIL\u2019s partners said, can travel approximately 400 km on a single hydrogen fill and can facilitate long-distance travel between cities on clean fuel. Hydrogen fill for this range coverage takes just about 15 minutes. These vehicles will undergo extensive trials, validation and safety trials over next 12 months, they said.Through its association with Ashok Leyland, RIL plans to retrofit the engines for Ashok Leyland's fleet of trucks before retrofitting the fleet of other service providers. RIL contracts a fleet of nearly 45,000 trucks every year to move goods for its refining and marketing operations. It wants to power them with green hydrogen.Green hydrogen is the cleanest form of fuel when produced through renewable sources of energy. RIL aims to produce green hydrogen at $1 per kilogram by 2030. The current production economics of green hydrogen works out to be around $8-9 per kilogram as compared to less than $4 per kilograms for other traditional fuels and feedstocks.\u201cThe domestic use cases for green hydrogen will remain confined to small pilots,\u201d said Barnik Chitran Maitra, managing partner, India & South Asia, of consulting firm Arthur D Little. \u201cWe expect the producers to sign up with global shipping firms, international transmission system operators, and international power generators which are likely to replace fossil fuel with green hydrogen over the next five years.\u201d RIL also plans to retail green hydrogen through its Jio-BP retail outlets. The company has around 1,500 retail outlets, which its plans to expand to 5,000.Satyakam Arya, managing director of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles, said the BharatBenz Hydrogen Fuel Cell luxury coach concept that it developed with RIL is the most recent example of conducting an advanced engineering study to decipher the market requirements, product capability and practical challenges, and use the findings in making the product and technology more robust.\u201cThe emerging industry landscape also throws up other challenges \u2014 investment in multiple technologies, all at the same time and on many fronts \u2014 by OEMs, for development of power trains; by the government, for development of infrastructure and by fleet owners, who would end up having different power trains in their fleet,\u201d Arya said, adding that this challenge should not be underestimated, and the enormity of it should be taken seriously.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries and Brookfield Asset Management have entered into an initial agreement with the aim of exploring opportunities for manufacturing renewable energy and decarbonization equipment within Australia.The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) seeks to accelerate as well as de-risk Australia's energy transition by enabling local production of clean energy equipment, including PV modules, long duration battery storage, and wind energy components, the Indian conglomerate said in a press statement.According to the initial agreement, Brookfield will collaborate with Reliance to explore avenues for direct capital investment and the development of skills, knowledge, and expertise in the renewable energy sector of Australia. This collaboration aims to facilitate the nation's journey towards a net-zero future.\u201cAt Reliance, we are firmly committed to the mission of creating a global clean energy ecosystem that is both beneficial to humanity and compatible with nature. Towards this end, Reliance is pursuing opportunities of investment in India and globally with great enthusiasm and passion,  said Anant Ambani, director at Reliance New Energy.  We are confident that Reliance and Brookfield will explore avenues in green energy in Australia, accelerating the nation\u2019s transition to a Net Zero future and providing a fillip to the global green energy movement.\u201dReliance and Brookfield will assess the feasibility of establishing advanced operations in Australia for the production or assembly of equipment utilised in renewable energy projects, supplying equipment to various players in the market, including Origin Energy Markets. Reliance boasts strong expertise in solar panel technology and long duration battery storage, and it is actively working on setting up one of the world's largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in India.The MoU with Reliance forms a significant part of Brookfield's efforts to bring global manufacturing technology and expertise to Australia. Earlier this year, Brookfield signed a binding agreement with EIG to acquire Origin Energy, a proposed acquisition that is currently undergoing relevant approval processes. Along with its institutional partners, GIC and Temasek, Brookfield has planned to invest between A$20 billion and A$30 billion over the next decade to expedite the country's energy transition.By collaborating with Reliance, Brookfield aims to secure a steady and adequate supply of clean energy equipment required to develop up to 14 GW of new, large-scale generation and storage capacity in Australia. Furthermore, independent analysis conducted for Brookfield indicates that establishing onshore sovereign manufacturing capabilities for the energy transition could potentially create approximately 18,000 direct and indirect jobs, with many opportunities located in regions most impacted by the transition, such as the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria.Luke Edwards, Brookfield Renewable Head of Australia, said that Australia has a proud history of manufacturing and an abundance of raw materials, but the industry is not currently cost competitive.  The energy transition creates an opportunity to bring advanced manufacturing processes created offshore to Australia, which would secure the supply of critical equipment for the transition to help drive down Australia\u2019s emissions faster and contribute significantly to job creation. We want to help kickstart a new era in local manufacturing that will benefit domestic renewables developers, including Origin Energy Markets, and many communities around Australia.,\u201d he added.102328290",

        "articleBody": "A village in the arid savannah of west Africa seems an unlikely place to mark the birth of an energy revolution. If promoters of the next big thing in clean power are right, however, we may all remember the name of Bourak\u00e9bougou in years to come. That\u2019s because the site 55 kilometers (34 miles) northwest of Mali\u2019s capital Bamako was the first place on earth powered by natural hydrogen \u2014 pure gas seeping from the earth, like crude oil or methane. The phenomenon is so anomalous that, until recently, few geologists had given it much thought. In 2011, Montreal-based Hydroma Inc. unplugged a water well near Bourak\u00e9bougou cemented up in 1987 after the air rising from it caused an explosion. The exhalations turned out to be 98% hydrogen, which was then burned to provide electricity to the village.That series of events seems to defy conventional geochemistry. Hydrogen is one of the most reactive elements \u2014 one reason it combines so readily with carbon to make fossil fuels. As a result, pure hydrogen is often assumed to be vanishingly rare in nature. Its role is so overlooked that gas chromatography \u2014 the process that chemists use to work out the composition of gaseous mixtures \u2014 typically uses hydrogen as a carrier material, making it impossible to detect in samples from underground wells.A growing wave of discoveries is now challenging that conventional wisdom, just as hydrogen manufactured from water and renewable energy looks set to disrupt fossil fuel\u2019s role in a host of industrial sectors. Aside from Bourak\u00e9bougou, wildcatters have found seeps of natural H2 in Oman, New Caledonia, Canada, Russia, Australia, Japan, Germany and New Zealand.Deposits in France could lead to the country producing 3 million metric tons a year, according to one recent report \u2014 roughly a third of the green hydrogen that the European Union wants to be manufacturing by 2030. Hyterra Ltd., an Australian company exploring for geologic hydrogen in the US, believes it can produce the element for $1 a kilogram \u2014 prices at which it might start to compete with natural gas. One 2020 study estimated that total global outflows of natural hydrogen might come to 23 million metric tons a year or more.A switch into natural hydrogen might represent the perfect way for the existing petroleum industry to decarbonize \u2014 shifting skills in geology and tapping underground fluids to a green fuel of the future.There are just two problems with this promising vision.The first is that we understand next to nothing about natural H2. Crude oil extraction dates back to antiquity, and geologists hypothesized it came from decayed organic matter in the 18th century. Drillers worked out that it got trapped in folded underground rock formations long before John D. Rockefeller turned crude into big business. That scientific understanding \u2014 and the wealth of knowledge that has built up since \u2014 vastly reduces the cost of exploring for hydrocarbon deposits.With natural hydrogen, we are in the dark. Scientists are divided about how it is even produced, with most theories centering on emergence from deep below the earth\u2019s crust, bacterial activity, or chemical processes. Seeps often appear to be associated with unusual circular depressions in the ground, known as \u201cfairy circles,\u201d but it\u2019s not well understood exactly why these form.Until such questions are solved and underground reservoirs are mapped out, it\u2019s going to be challenging for hydrogen startups to take on the giants of the energy industry. Hyterra\u2019s Kansas and Nebraska prospects might be an attractive option as feedstock for the fertilizer consumed so readily in the Great Plains \u2014 but any plant set up to exploit the resource will want to know whether the wells will keep producing for 20 years or two months. That\u2019s still not clear.The other issue is related. That estimate of 23 million tons a year sounds like a lot \u2014 but in energy terms, it\u2019s paltry. The EU alone hopes to be consuming 20 million tons a year of manufactured green hydrogen by 2030, and even that is barely enough to slake the world\u2019s fossil-fuel appetites. In energy terms, 23 million tons of hydrogen represents about 2.76 exajoules \u2014 similar to the amount of natural gas we consume every week.It\u2019s early days for natural hydrogen, so don\u2019t be too dispirited. No one has really been looking for this stuff until now, and predictions about the availability of mineral resources are almost always underestimates. (In 1919, the US Geological Survey predicted that country would start running out of oil in two to five years.)Rich reserves of natural H2 may yet become the 21st century\u2019s equivalent of the oilfields of the Persian Gulf, Siberia and Texas. As with fusion energy, however, you\u2019d be brave to bet on a revolution this side of 2050.",

        "articleBody": "India and Singapore have fast-tracked plans to connect their power grids through an undersea cable via Andaman & Nicobar, which will allow India to sell renewable energy to Singapore, people in the know said. An agreement is expected to be signed soon. The landed cost of the renewable energy that will be exported through this arrangement to Singapore is projected to be cheaper than their gas-based electricity,  one of the sources said, making an economic case for the investment.Singapore also needs to fulfil its nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement and taking renewable energy from India will help in achieving that target.The two countries held discussions on the matter on the sidelines of the G20 Energy Ministerial and Clean Energy Ministerial meetings earlier this month, sources said. A detailed study will be prepared on further feasibility, but Singapore is keen on the plan, they said.State-owned Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd is carrying out further studies on the technical aspects of the project.Singapore had earlier said that since expanding renewable energy for the country is limited by land scarcity and intermittent solar power, it would explore a variety of different options, including regional power grids.Being isolated from the mainland, the Andaman & Nicobar Islands have unique challenges in terms of power supply. The union territory's cumulative generation capacity is around 109.45 MW in various islands, of which, diesel-based generation is almost 91%, and the rest is hydro and solar.The arrangement with Singapore will benefit the islands' connectivity as well, especially with renewable energy.India has also been in talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to connect with their power grids to trade renewable energy. This proposal has been in the works along with Oman, where India could look to make a stop, before taking the connectivity further to the UAE and Saudi Arabia.",

Supply of surplus stock of rice from central pool by FCI for conversion into ethanol was started in the year 2020-21,  Minister of State for Food and Consumer Affairs Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said in a written reply to Lok Sabha. According to the data furnished in the reply, the revenue generated by FCI by selling surplus rice for production of ethanol stood at Rs 98 crore in 2020-21, 2136 crore in 2021-22 and Rs 2610 crore till July 10 in 2022-23 ethanol supply year (December-November). The lifting of rice stood at 0.49 lakh tonnes in 2020-21, 10.68 lakh tonnes in 2021-22 and 13.05 lakh tonnes till July 10 in 2022-23 supply year. The government has been implementing Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme wherein oil marketing companies (OMCs) sell petrol blended with ethanol up to 10 per cent. Ethanol is being produced mainly by sugar mills from sugarcane crop. This programme has been extended to whole of India except Union Territories of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands with effect from April 2019 to promote the use of alternative and environment-friendly fuels. This intervention also seeks to reduce import dependence for energy requirements and give a boost to the agriculture sector. The government has advanced the target of 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol from earlier 2030 to 2025-26.",

In fiscal 2023, PFC's consolidated revenue stood at Rs 77,568.30 crore, up from Rs 76,261.66 crore a year ago from which the company earned a net income of Rs 21,178.6 crore against Rs 18,768.2 crore in the previous year. As of March 2023, its loan book stood at Rs 4.32 lakh crore, of which Rs 3.2 lakh crore have been lent to state power companies and Rs 73,000 crore to private power companies. During the same period, its outstanding borrowings stood at Rs 3.63 lakh crore of which 63 per cent are domestic bonds and USD7.2 billion are in overseas currencies primarily in dollars and euros. Of the total disbursals, 78 per cent are to the conventional sector and almost 10 per cent are to the renewables, making PFC the largest player in these two segments.",

It has already commissioned the world\u2019s largest hybrid solar-wind project of 2.14 GW in Rajasthan, Adani said. We are now building the largest hybrid renewable park in Khavda. It will be the most complex and ambitious project that we have ever executed. Spread over more than 72,000 acres, this project will be capable of generating 20 gigawatt of green energy,  Adani said.New businesses of the company now account for 50% of its Ebitda, Adani said in his address.The company's renewables portfolio has grown by 49% to 8 GW and this is now the largest of its kind in India, he added.According to Adani, the focus is now firmly on producing lowest-cost green electron at scale. I would like to reaffirm our target of 45 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030,  he said.Adani also talked of the upcoming hybrid renewable project right in the middle of the desert, which he said will produce 20 GW once it is operational. From the execution viewpoint, the company intend to complete it faster than any other project that came before it, he said.Adani Green energy arm of the Gautam Adani-led Adani Group, has been planning to raise Rs 12,300 crore ($1.5 billion) by selling shares in a qualified institutional placement (QIP), according to reports.In May 2023, the group flagship had said that it was looking to raise Rs 12,500 crore in a QIP. Adani Transmission had said it would raise Rs 8,500 crore through the same route.The fundraising will ease Adani's concerns over servicing debt, in addition to instilling confidence among investors.The funds will be used to expand green energy operations. QIPs allows listed companies to raise capital without depending on foreign capital resources.AGEL is the top player in India's renewable energy segment. In March, it had said its operating renewable portfolio reached 8,024 MW after opening its fourth wind-solar hybrid power plant in Jaisalmer.AGEL has set a target of 45 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030. Adani transmission too is accelerating with transmission business and continues to grow faster than the marketAdani Group has been trying to bring back investor confidence after shortseller Hindenburg's report in January 2023 caused a deep rout in its stocks. The scripts have since recovered some of the lost ground though.",

        "articleBody": "Wind and solar projects are on track to account for more than a third of the world's electricity by 2030, signalling that the energy sector can achieve the change needed to meet global climate goals, a report by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) said on Thursday. Sultan al-Jaber, president of the next UN climate summit, COP28, earlier this year called for a tripling of renewable energy generation by 2030 to curb greenhouse gas emissions and help reach goals set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Exponential sector growth means wind and solar projects are predicted to generate at least 33% of global electricity, up from around 12% now, leading to a fall in fossil fuel-powered generation and cheaper power, the RMI report showed. The RMI, a U.S.-based non-profit organisation focused on clean energy, carried out the research in partnership with the Bezos Earth Fund, a $10 billion fund created by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos to help fund solutions to climate change. The cost of solar power, which is already the cheapest form of electricity production, will fall as low as $20 per megawatt hour (MWh) from around $40 MWh currently, as more projects are deployed and economies of scale improve, the report said.  The benefit of rapid renewable deployment is greater energy security and independence, plus long-term energy price deflation because this is a manufactured technology - the more you install the cheaper it gets,  said Kingsmill Bond, Senior Principal at RMI.

        "articleBody": "India wants to become a global hub for the production of green hydrogen, manufactured by splitting water molecules using renewable energy. It is an ambitious plan for a country whose hydrogen consumed currently is produced mostly with fossil fuels. Although first production is expected only in 2026, India has been negotiating bilateral agreements with the European Union, Japan and other countries to start exporting the fuel. Below are some details about India's green hydrogen push and challenges. PRODUCTION TARGETIndia aims for annual production of 5 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2030, which would cut about 50 million metric tons of carbon emissions and save more than $12 billion on fossil fuel imports. Indian companies including Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, Adani Enterprises , JSW Energy, ReNew Power and Acme Solar have made announcements for setting up a cumulative annual green hydrogen manufacturing capacity of 3.5 million metric tons. As of now, most of the 5 million metric tons of hydrogen consumed in the country is produced with fossil fuels. GOVERNMENT SUPPORTIn January, India approved an incentive plan of 174.9 billion rupees ($2.11 billion) to promote green hydrogen. This would be atleast 10% of the cost to produce green hydrogen. New Delhi has also extended a waiver of transmission fees for renewable power to hydrogen manufacturing plants commissioned before January 2031. AUCTIONSThe government has kicked off auctions under its incentive programme for manufacturing electrolysers used to make green hydrogen. Bidding for support for green hydrogen production has yet to start. Five states including industrialised ones like Maharashtra and Gujarat have announced benefits like concessional electricity and duty-reimbursements on production of green hydrogen and its derivatives. CHALLENGESGreen hydrogen is currently more expensive to produce than hydrogen made using fossil fuels, costing about $2 more per kilogram. The other issue is that renewable energy is not available round-the-clock and battery storage is still not economical. The country expects a requirement of 125 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030 for production linked only to the incentive programme. India's current installed renewable base is 127 gigawatts. Europe, Korea and Japan, being renewable resource-deficient, are likely to be the key markets for green hydrogen but trade barriers are a major worry. India has raised its concerns with Germany on barriers imposed in a global green hydrogen tender called by that country last December. India also faces competition from heavily subsidised markets like China and the United States.",

The understanding was reached during a meeting of the governing council of the Pancheshwar Development Authority held in Pokhara in Nepal on Thursday and Friday, The Kathmandu Post newspaper reported.   The meeting decided to extend the term of the team of experts which expired in March,  the report quoted Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation ministry spokesperson Madhu Bhetuwal as saying.   The two sides also agreed to hold the next meeting of the team of experts within 10 days to iron out the differences over the DPR (detailed project report) and make a move towards concluding the DPR,  he said.  Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project (PMP) is a bi-national hydropower project to be developed on the Mahakali River bordering Nepal and India. The development of the project is covered under the integrated Mahakali Treaty signed between Nepal and India in 1996 under which equal sizes of underground powerhouses of 3,240 MV will be constructed on each side of the Mahakali river in India and Nepal.  Apart from generating electricity, the project will provide irrigation to 130,000 hectares of land in Nepal and 240,000 hectares in India in addition to other incidental benefits including flood protection.  However, a mutually acceptable DPR of the Pancheshwar Project could not be finalised due to differences on certain contentious issues.   There were more than 500 unresolved issues which have now come down to 127,  said Bhetuwal, who is also a joint secretary at the energy ministry of Nepal.  The upcoming meeting of the experts, the date of which is yet to be finalised, is the first move towards concluding the DPR after the prime ministers of both countries last month agreed to conclude the DPR within three months during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda's India visit from May 31 to June 3, the report said.  During Prachanda's visit to India, it was agreed that officials of both governments would expedite bilateral discussions towards early finalisation of the Pancheshwar DPR within three months.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s plans to introduce hydrogen as a fuel have gained momentum with the VO Chidambaranar (VOC) Port in Tamil Nadu and the Deendayal Port in Gujarat all set to develop hydrogen hubs.The shipping ministry has asked these two ports to also buy hydrogen powered \u2018green tug\u2019 boats, used for ushering large ships into berths, said officials aware of the development. The Cochin Shipyard is in advanced stages of developing green tugs that run on hydrogen, they said.\u201cUnder the green tug transition programme, the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Paradip Port, VOC Port and the Deendayal Port will be buying two green tugs each. In addition, hydrogen hubs will be set up at VOC and Deendayal ports to catalyse the transition towards green fuel,\u201d a senior official aware of the development told ET.In addition, the Centre is aiming to have two Indian ships that are powered by green hydrogen or its derivative fuels by 2027.This will be followed by the addition of at least two ships powered by green fuels every year, said officials. These plans are in line with India\u2019s goals to decarbonise its ports under the Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines 2023.The objective of the guidelines is to minimise waste through efforts to \u201creduce, reuse, repurpose and recycle\u201d to attain zero waste discharge from port operations and promote monitoring, based on environmental performance indicators.The Green Ports Policy paves the way for incentives to fleet owners for adoption of compressed natural gas, LNG, electric or green hydrogen-powered trucks. The move is aimed at reducing the intensity of emissions at major ports.",

        "articleBody": "India has discussed a possible deal to supply more than 11 million metric tons a year of green hydrogen to the European Union and Singapore, who in turn would invest in these Indian clean energy projects, three government officials and one industry source said. Reuters reported on Tuesday that New Delhi will consider bilateral agreements which would allow countries to use carbon credits linked to producing so-called green hydrogen, which is made using renewable energy. India and the EU explored green hydrogen agreements for 10 million metric tons per annum under which businesses in the bloc could invest in projects in India and claim carbon credits, one of the officials, who attended a meeting on Wednesday in New Delhi, told Reuters. Singapore is looking to get 5 million metric tons per annum of green ammonia through similar bilateral agreements, which is equivalent to another 1-1.5 million metric tons a year of green hydrogen, another official said. The officials did not give details on the length or the starting year of such contracts.  Green ammonia, generally the preferred form in which the fuel is transported, is a green hydrogen derivative. None of the officials wanted to be named as talks are ongoing.  India's renewable energy ministry, an Indian government spokesperson and a communications officer at the EU office in New Delhi did not immediately reply to requests for comment.  The meetings hosted by the Indian government on Wednesday were also attended by Indian renewable companies including Avaada Group, Renew Power and ACME Group.  The bilateral agreements being discussed with the EU and Singapore present a significant business opportunity for Indian Green Hydrogen manufacturers,  Avaada Chairman Vineet Mittal said. Indian companies such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and Adani Enterprises have big plans for green hydrogen. Countries around the globe are turning to hydrogen to drive a transition away from fossil fuels to address global warming. India last year sought to further its ambitions to become a major green hydrogen exporter through the approval of a 174.9 billion rupees ($2.13 billion) incentive plan and a target to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.",

As one of the world's biggest emitters of climate-warming gases, India is betting on green hydrogen to help cut its emissions and to reach its target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.  Some countries are putting barriers on green hydrogen (trade and technology). If they are putting up barriers we will also put up barriers, then you will be losing out on our market,  Singh said at the International Conference on Green Hydrogen. India is already in discussions with Germany over conditions in its hydrogen purchase tender with the European Union, which members of Indian industry found restrictive, renewable energy secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said last month. The tender, issued in December, has a condition stating that the distance between the hydrogen manufacturing plant and the renewable energy plant should be 500 kilometres or less, an industry source at the conference told Reuters. Singh did not elaborate on what India's retaliatory barriers may be. He told the conference that Indian companies have already set plans to manufacture 3.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen. Last year, New Delhi approved a 174.9 billion rupees incentive plan for the fuel, which is made using renewable energy and without producing greenhouse gases. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030. Earlier this year, Singh said that huge subsidies announced by some developed countries for their green hydrogen sectors can distort trade and is in violation of World Trade Organization (WTO) norms.",

We will also help you with demand as well. Come and partner with us,  PTI quoted Singh as saying while addressing the conference attended by over 2,500 participants.  The investors can partner for development of electrolysers, mechanism for transportation of green hydrogen, usage of green hydrogen in manufacturing for green steel and cement etc, he said adding India is the biggest market in the world.  Like the field of renewable energy, India shall emerge as a leader in green hydrogen also, Singh said.  There are industries which have started working to set up 3.5 MT capacity of green hydrogen. They are engaged with various states for acquisition of land, he informed the attendees which included diplomats and industry leaders across various countries.  That's the pace at which India is growing, he noted.  In January 2023, the Centre approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore with an aim to make India a global hub for manufacturing green hydrogen.  The mission seeks to promote development of a production capacity of at least 5 MMT (Million Metric Tonne) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.(With inputs from PTI)",

        "articleBody": "India is considering bilateral agreements with countries such as Japan to allow them to use carbon credits linked to green hydrogen production in India in exchange for investment and purchase deals, two government sources and one industry source told Reuters. New Delhi this year approved a 174.9 billion rupee ($2.13 billion) incentive plan to promote green hydrogen in a bid to cut carbon dioxide emissions and become a major exporter in the sector.  Indian companies such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and Adani Enterprises have big plans for green hydrogen, a fuel generated using renewable energy. Trading in carbon credits - earned by projects for reduction of greenhouse gases and each equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide - can bring in more investments and assured offtake to India, said the sources, all of whom declined to be named as the discussions are not public. Any agreements will see overseas companies or financial agencies signing investment and purchase deals with Indian green hydrogen makers, the sources said, adding that India is already in talks with Japan. On March 17, Japan and India signed a preliminary agreement to establish a joint crediting system (JCM) for decarbonisation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which is a legally binding international treaty on climate change, according to a document seen by Reuters.  Article 6 provides for sharing of carbon credits between countries and private companies. This would allow buyers of green hydrogen to also get carbon emissions credit for green hydrogen production, which would otherwise be credited to the producers. Japan already has agreements with 26 countries including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. The Indian ministries of environment, renewable energy and external affairs have held discussions on the proposed carbon-trading agreements, said the sources. The government has spoken with the industry too ahead of a three-day international summit on green hydrogen on Wednesday in New Delhi, they said. The three ministries did not respond to emails seeking comment. Japan's Indian embassy said their response might be delayed. Reuters could not immediately determine the other countries India was in talks with.  The Global North's capacity and technology, combined with the Global South's vast potential for green development, can lead to impactful climate action,  said Shekhar Dutt, director general of Indian industry body Solar Power Developers Association. The body this month wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking measures to leverage provisions of international treaties and commitments from developed nations to better compete with the U.S. green hydrogen industry, which has far more government backing. Dutt said India could benefit from the European Union's target of importing 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 by leveraging Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.",

        "articleBody": "Global industrial gases company Linde Plc sees significant growth coming from traditional as well as new segments in India. Linde in India is planning to invest $1 billion to expand India operations in three-five years and $50 billion globally in the next 10 years, CEO Sanjiv Lamba tells Kalpana Pathak. Edited excerpts:What plans do you have for Linde in India?India as you know as a percentage of my global business is very small and disappointingly so. India gases business has a 3% share. Right now, we've got a five-year plan and the interim vision is to get to 5%. Also, in the same period I expect a billion dollars or more to be invested in India. I also see a very bright future for the engineering division. We have a huge competitive advantage because of the technical capabilities. The engineering group in India plays a critical role. So, most of the billion dollars will get executed by the project engineering group.What role do you see Linde playing in India's green hydrogen economy?I'm very pleased that the government has provided incentives. This will spur activity and that's the right thing to do because you want innovation, you want technology to scale up and improve. I'm hoping that we will be leading some of the developments in that space and you'll hear more about that in the days ahead. In India, the focus at the moment seems to be around green hydrogen or electrolysis hydrogen. I however, don't necessarily agree with the view that's been taken that you will get green hydrogen for $1 Kg. I will say somewhat practically that it's nonsense. We've operated in this industry. We are the only company that has run a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser for more than 12 months.Electrolysers by their very nature are crude technology. You take electrons. You take power, 54 kilowatts, to generate one kg of hydrogen. You basically use brute force to split the molecule and you separate hydrogen and oxygen. So, there isn't much you can do from process optimization, etc. You can only scale up in terms of the size of the electrolyser, nothing more than that. So if you put all that together what you get out of the electrolysis process is expensive green hydrogen. We're doing a lot of work around PEM electrolysis and we're building electrolysers of every other technology. But I still see a technology roadmap that will be at least five to seven years from now for scalable, cost effective, safe, reliable green hydrogen to be available.What kind of growth do you think the hydrogen economy could bring for Linde?I have to say that the best incentive for hydrogen in the world is in the US. The Inflation Reduction Act has provided some amazingly generous incentives that have built huge momentum in the US market investments both on blue hydrogen and green hydrogen. We're seeing many projects. We're currently working on 200 projects globally. In the next 10 years, we will make $50 billion worth investment decisions around clean energy. So nearly transformative change is happening. And we find ourselves wonderfully well positioned. We currently have a $3 billion revenue business globally, perhaps it's about 10% of our revenue. I expect that to grow five to 10 times over the next 10 to 15 years. So, it's going to be a very significant number for us as a corporation.Globally Linde is doing a lot in the liquid hydrogen space. Could you elaborate?I have ambitious plans for liquid hydrogen. I believe that that's one of the ways for the future. And in addition to that, we are also the company that offers the best hydrogen refuelling for trucks, buses, cars and ferries in Scandinavia. We run 14 trains on hydrogen in Germany. Anything that carries a payload of hydrogen has a comparative advantage and I think they see a future for us kind of moving down that path as well.We have the world's first underground cavern for high purity hydrogen storage. It's in Texas, US. We also are one of the first companies in the world that has got approval to move hydrogen at high pressure. I think the future is liquid hydrogen moving from point A to point B across countries within the country etc. And that liquefaction technology is going to be super critical. We are scaling up 10 times what is currently available. So, you know, small plants are available today at 30 tonnes per day we're looking to scale that up to 400 tonnes per day.What are the growth segments for Linde in India going forward?In terms of new end markets, I see electronics growth happening in India. I also believe that one of the areas that will get a lot more growth as we look ahead, is food and beverage. There is so much wastage of food today that I think if we get into cryogenic freezing of food, it will be good. Then I see healthcare providing a great opportunity for growth. We have a suite of products around gases for healthcare, medical oxygen, obviously everyone knows from Covid-19. We do a lot of work with premature children. We provide helium oxygen mixtures to help them breathe. And of course, manufacturing, chemicals, refining and steel too. These are all powerhouses for growth. So, I'm excited that those traditional markets will see significant growth, but new markets will also come.",

        "articleBody": "The centre is mulling a proposal to set up Liquefied natural gas (LNG) dispensing stations for trucks inside ports by using floating storage units (FSU) as an interim measure. These suggestions will guide development of LNG storage facilities at nine major ports under the administrative control of the Shipping Ministry. Four major ports, Deendayal Port (Kandla), Chennai, Cochin Port, and Kamarajar Port (Ennore), already have LNG terminals in their vicinity. A FSU is an old ship anchored near the port with natural gas storage capacity.Major ports come under the administrative control of the shipping ministry, while the remaining ports (called non-major) come under the state governments and their maritime boards.According to the plan under consideration, the floating storage unit (FSU) allows flexibility of using the same ship as an LNG carrier for the initial period when gas send outs are low. \u201cCapital investment is low and this saves LNG chartering cost for initial few lean years,\u201d a senior government official told ET.Once natural gas consumption rises at these ports, with more LNG trucks being deployed, conversion to a land based terminal is easy by installing a tank and additional regasification capacity. This approach has been adopted in other countries such as Nicaragua, Philippines, Ghana, and Ecuador, as well, the official added.These plans are in line with India\u2019s goals to decarbonise its ports under the Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines 2023. The objective of guidelines is to minimize waste through Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose and Recycle to attain zero waste discharge from port operations and promote monitoring, based on Environmental Performance Indicators.They also cover aspects of National Green Hydrogen Mission pertaining to ports, development of green hydrogen facility, LNG bunkering, and Offshore Wind Energy among others. The Green Port policy also paves way for incentives to fleet owners for adoption of Compressed Natural Gas, LNG, electric or green hydrogen-powered trucks. The move is aimed at reducing the intensity of emissions at major ports. ",

        "articleBody": "The Indian government is preparing a new multi-billion dollar subsidy scheme for companies making electricity grid batteries as part of its transition to clean energy, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing a power ministry proposal. The draft proposal for a production-linked incentive subsidy scheme would offer 216 billion rupees ($2.63 billion) from this year through to 2030 for companies to set up manufacturing capacity for battery cells in India, the FT reported. The draft plan seen by the FT acknowledged there was a limit to how much more coal power India could build.   International opinion  and  environmental concerns\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009make expansion of coal-based thermal generation beyond a limit, an infeasible option,  according to the draft plan.  India's power ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Apart from energy transition, domestic battery cell manufacturing is also essential to reducing the country's dependence on rival China for battery imports, the draft plan said.   If India does not take urgent steps to set up local manufacturing capacity of battery energy storage systems, imperatives of our energy transition would lead to huge imports from China,  the proposal document seen by FT said.",

Bajaj, TVS and Hero scooters will run on 100 per cent ethanol,  the minister said. Gadkari said he would launch Toyota company's Camry car in August, which will run 100 per cent on ethanol and it will also generate 40 per cent electricity.  If you compare it with petrol, it will be Rs 15 per litre of petrol because ethanol's rate is Rs 60 while the rate of petrol is Rs 120 per litre. Plus it would generate 40 per cent electricity. The average would be Rs 15 per litre,  he added.",

The G20 Summit, under India's presidency, has also identified energy transition as a key focus area. Both countries could look to collaborate on reducing the cost of green and clean hydrogen,  one of the persons said.The production of green hydrogen is currently a high-cost prospect but is expected to become viable with scale.India has ambitious plans in the green hydrogen space. The National Green Hydrogen Mission aims at a production capacity of at least 5 million metric tonnes a year by 2030. The US' Hydrogen Energy Earthshot, launched in 2021, seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1/kg in a decade.India has led discussions on the carbon capture utilisation and storage technology as part of the G20 side events and is open to conduct more pilot projects on it, another person said. The major challenges for CCUS are high cost per unit and what kind of technology to use for storage, he added.According to a report from NITI Aayog in November, carbon capture utilisation and storage deployment has mostly been concentrated in the US, because of the low cost of capture from natural gas, processing facilities, carbon pipeline networks and government funding, among others.With India's ambitious target of 500 GW of electricity from non-fossil sources, battery storage is imperative with efforts being made globally to bring its cost down.India has been keen on battery energy storage systems, apart from pumped hydro storage. It has already announced a viability gap funding for setting up battery energy storage systems.The partnership on battery energy storage between the two countries is likely at the industry level to speed up its viability and adoption, sources said.",

        "articleBody": "India has set an ambitious target of 500 GW of non-fossil-based electricity generation capacity by 2030. At present-,we are at about 177GW. Most of the addition would come from solar and wind as contributions from hydro and nuclear will not be more than 30GW.So far distribution companies (discoms) have been procuring intermittent and seasonally available generation from solar and wind and supplying their consumers with reliable power by combining with their large firm power portfolio.While procurement by discoms would continue to be the largest share of additional renewable power generation, consumption by green hydrogen producers, other commercial and industrial consumers pursuing their voluntary emission reduction or netzero targets would also grow rapidly.Similarly, industrial units with captive power plants would need to procure intermittent green energy to fulfill their Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO). Green hydrogen of 5 million tonnes per annum by 2030 alone would need 125 GW of green energy.Recognising this business opportunity, several investors have come forward to set up merchant renewable energy (RE) generation plants. However, any industrial process or commercial establishment such as a data centre requires reliable and year-round supply of electricity, be it green or brown.Therefore, the supply of dispatchable RE power would necessitate combining power supply from solar, wind, and hydro supported by energy storage systems. Supplying to consumers from multiple sources of generation/storage would require intermediaries like power traders with round-theclock scheduling control rooms, and also non-discriminatory open access to the grid at reasonable charges.This will open up huge opportunities for investment in merchant RE plants and new grid-scale energy storage systems, create green jobs in intermediary entities and help industrial units earn carbon credits if they use RE and overachieve emission intensity reduction targets.While several initiatives have been taken by the central government to facilitate the exploitation of these opportunities, many challenges remain to be addressed.The most significant reform is the General Network Access regime under which a RE generator can change its customer anytime without any difficulty in availing transmission services. The central transmission utility has made applying for transmission connectivity simple and online.Several policy initiatives have been taken to promote the development of energy storage projects \u2013 both pumped storage projects (PSP) and battery storage projects. As announced in the union budget this year, the power ministry has notified guidelines for the development of PSP. The environment ministry has notified a simpler clearance process for PSP if they propose to use existing reservoirs. The Central Electricity Authority has also reduced timelines for giving clearance to PSP.Under the Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO) trajectory notified by the Ministry of Power up to 2030, separate obligations have been given for procuring a percentage of RE with storage facilities. The launch of the National Green Hydrogen Mission early this year has also given a boost to investment in PSP.In the last two months, several bigticket investments in PSP in states like Maharashtra, AP, and Tamil Nadu have been announced. In Uttar Pradesh also, an investment proposal in PSP has been received.The budget has also announced viability gap funding (VGF) support to grid-scale battery storage projects of a total capacity of 4000-Megawatt hour capacity.The power ministry had already notified rules for providing electricity storage systems in the power system under the Electricity Act.Further, the Green Open Access Rules notified last year have been operationalised and a national portal is already receiving applications to GridIndia for green open access. These rules permit open access to green energy for loads up to 100 kilowatts, with a deeming provision for sanction of applications in 15 days.The major threat to green open access is being seen in terms of very high open access charges notified by State Electricity Regulatory Commissions in some states.The Electricity Act provides that any consumer \u2013 with a load above a threshold as notified in rules or regulations \u2013 can seek open access for procuring power from a source other than the distribution licensee in whose geographical area such a consumer is situated. Such a consumer is required to pay a crosssubsidy surcharge, in addition to transmission and wheeling charges for the use of transmission and distribution networks. There is also a provision of surcharge in addition to wheeling charges to meet the stranded costs, if any, of the distribution licensee out of its universal obligation to supply.The Act mandates non-discriminatory open access and such charges have to be reasonable if the objective of the law to provide open access is to be realised. For example, if green energy with necessary storage costs is available for Rs 4.5 per unit but total open access charges levied in a state are Rs 4 per unit, open access is going to be a non-starter.In order to rationalise the cross-subsidy surcharge, rules already provide that it cannot be more than one-fifth of the average cost of supply.However, some SERCs have notified very high wheeling charges and additional surcharges. In one of the states in southern India, these charges add up to Rs 4.09 per unit for an open-access consumer drawing half megawatt power at 11-kilovolt level.These charges need to be reviewed and rationalised immediately if we have to realise the goal of 500 GW of non-fossil-based capacity.Another area requiring attention is clarity on taxation for the use of energy storage devices as this is a new service in the electricity industry.(The authour is Power Secretary)",

        "articleBody": "Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) may earn nearly $10-15 billion from its new energy business spanning solar to hydrogen by 2030, however, it will need acquisitions or partnerships to make up for limited expertise in technology, reported PTI, citing a report by Sanford C Bernstein, on Sunday. Clean energy (solar, battery, electrolyzers, and fuel cells) represents a new growth pillar for Reliance with $2 trillion in investment in India through 2050. India is targeting solar capacity of 280GW and 5 million tonnes of green H2 production by 2030.   We expect EV penetration will reach 5 per cent for passenger and commercial vehicles and 21 per cent for two-wheelers. Clean energy could have a TAM (total addressable market) of $30 billion in 2030 ($10 billion currently). By 2050, we estimate the TAM could reach $200 billion and cumulative spending of $2 trillion,  PTI quoted the brokerage report as saying. Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance has announced forays into solar manufacturing as well as hydrogen in pivot away from fossil fuels. Reliance plans to have 100GW of installed solar capacity by 2030 which is 35 per cent of India's targeted capacity of 280GW.   By 2030, we estimate Reliance could capture 60 per cent, 30 per cent and 20 per cent of solar, battery and hydrogen TAM respectively,  Bernstein said.   Based on our assumptions, we estimate RIL can achieve around $10-15 billion of revenue from new energy business in 2030 which represents roughly 40 per cent of the TAM.   Reliance is building a green energy business to supply the equipment India will need for its green energy revolution. Reliance has committed to being a net zero carbon emission company by 2035, which is earlier than the target of any other energy company in the region.  It is building a fully integrated end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem for customers through solar, batteries and hydrogen.   While Reliance has the balance sheet and relationships, they lack the technology and manufacturing know-how which will be essential for success,  the brokerage said.  Funding is not an issue for Reliance given the current balance sheet and free cash flow outlook.  The India government has set a target of 500GW of installed renewable energy by 2030. Of this, solar is expected to account for the largest share with 280GW. As of February 2023, India had 65GW of solar power.  To integrate interruptible renewable energy (wind and solar), India is estimated to require 88GWh of cumulative energy storage system (ESS) capacity by 2030 which represents 7 per cent of solar and wind capacity installed. By 2050, ESS capacity is expected to reach 15 per cent of total installed wind and solar capacity.  For transport, the Indian government has an EV sales penetration target of 30 per cent for private cars, 70 per cent for commercial vehicles and 80 per cent for two and three-wheelers by 2030.   With India EV penetration at only 1 per cent today, we think this will take longer given lack of charging infrastructure, lack of affordable EV options and no established battery supply chain. Two-wheelers will see stronger adoption than other vehicles reaching above 20 per cent in 2030 and 75 per cent by 2040 in our view,  the report said.  India has set a target of 5 million tonne of annual green hydrogen production by 2030.   Based on 45 per cent load factor and 63 per cent efficiency, we expect 81GW of cumulative electrolyzer capacity is required to generate 5 million tonne of green hydrogen,  it said adding green hydrogen is to be used to replace grey hydrogen, produced using gas, as it moves to decarbonise sectors such as oil and fertilisers.  For the New Energy business, it estimated Reliance will begin to recognize revenue in FY25 with the start of solar and battery plants in 2024.   Overall, solar will have the largest TAM of $13 billion by 2030 followed by hydrogen at $10 billion and batteries at $7 billion. We estimate Reliance can obtain $8 billion of revenue from solar by 2030. For batteries, Reliance could potentially capture a large part of the TAM starting in 2025+ and reach $3 billion by 2030. Hydrogen has potentially more opportunities with only $2 billion by 2030.   For solar, it expects Reliance to reach 100GW of installation by 2030. For batteries, Reliance could also achieve a similar market share of 36 per cent with battery capacity of 50GWh versus expected battery capacity of 139GWh in 2030.  For hydrogen, Reliance can capture about 19 per cent of the market with 16GW of cumulative electrolyzer capacity by 2030 versus expected TAM of 81GW.(With inputs from PTI)",

        "articleBody": "The Cummins Group plans to invest about $1 billion into its India operations and hire 4,000 people over the next decade as the global manufacturer of engines and power generation products braces for the transition from the traditional fossil fuel engines to those powered by hydrogen and other green energy choices. We have invested a billion dollars in India over the past 15 years,  said Ashwath Ram, managing director, Cummins Group, India.  We plan to invest a similar amount over the next decade to be able to transition from the current technologies to new ones. Most of the automotive business of Cummins in India is via Tata Cummins, and some of the investment is also done through subsidiary companies. In April this year, Cummins signed a definitive agreement with Tata Motors to manufacture a range of low-to zero-emissions technology products in India over the next few years.The two companies have set up a new business entity called TCPL Green Energy Solutions (GES), and it will become operational in FY25.Meanwhile, the listed entity Cummins India (CIL) is looking to double its investment in the coming years to '350 crore to '400 crore per annum as it partners with various automakers in the latter's switch to green mobility. Our investment is set to go up significantly, doubling in the coming years as compared with the past two to three years. There are many more technology intensive products being developed which will increase our capex cycle,  said Ram.Through the past decade, Cummins invested in building infrastructure. This has changed to investing in growth-based products to facilitate entry into new segments, new markets, and into electrification of the business. CIL will meet the funding requirement through internal accruals.A participant in the government's productivity-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, Cummins Group plans to invest Rs1,000 crore in India over a five-year period starting from FY 2022-23. This includes investment in technology and doesn't account for the capex in creating infrastructure, said Ram.100974871Cummins has been a beneficiary of stricter legislation on emissions. The advancements have helped the company move up the value chain and become a manufacturer of sophisticated parts high in electronic content. India is no longer lagging the world in terms of emission standards, said Ram, citing an instance of the switch over to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) II to CPCB IV + genset norms. Effective July 1, the norms will make gensets more fuel efficient and costlier. The transition in emission norms may need 30-50% price hikes in the sub-800kW genset range. The sharp price difference will likely boost pre-buying and aid 1QFY24F sales and EBITDA,  wrote Priyankar Biswas, analyst, Nomura Research, in a recent report.",

        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: State-owned power producer National Hydro Electric Power Corporation Private Limited (NHPC) has signed an agreement with the Maharashtra government to build pumped storage hydro projects totalling 7,350 MW capacity with an investment of Rs 44,000 crore. The MoU (memorandum of understanding) envisages development of four pumped storage projects aggregating to a total capacity of 7,350 MW, namely Kalu - 1,150 MW, Savitri - 2,250 MW, Jalond - 2,400 MW and Kengadi -1,550 MW, a power ministry statement said.  Other renewable energy source projects too will be developed in the state under the agreement, it stated.   A memorandum of understanding has been signed between NHPC Limited and department of energy, government of Maharashtra, for the development of pumped storage schemes and other renewable energy source projects in Maharashtra,  it said.  The MoU entails harnessing the pumped storage projects as energy storage solutions to help achieve the national objective of energy transition, i.e., to have 500 GW of installed capacity of renewable energy by 2030 and become net zero by 2070.  NHPC Chairman and Managing Director R K Vishnoi expressed his gratitude to the government of Maharashtra for reposing their trust in NHPC for development of pumped storage schemes in the state.  He said in the statement that this will be a stepping start for NHPC in Maharashtra.  These projects will attract an investment of about Rs 44,000 crore and generate indirect and direct employment for 7,000 people in the state, he added.  The MoU was signed in the presence of Maharashtra's deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.  The MoU was signed by Director (Projects), NHPC, Biswajit Basu, and Principal Secretary (Energy), Department of Energy, Maharashtra, Abha Shukla.  Pumped storage system utilises surplus grid power available from thermal power stations or other sources to pump up water from lower to upper reservoir and reproduces power during peak demand when there is scarcity of power.  NHPC Ltd is a central public sector enterprise and is the largest hydropower development organisation in the country with capabilities to undertake all the activities from conceptualisation to commissioning of hydro projects.  NHPC has also diversified in the fields of solar & wind energy development. The company is mandated to plan, promote and organise an integrated and efficient development of power in all its aspects through conventional and non-conventional sources in India and abroad.",

        "articleBody": "Australia's energy transition is well under way. Some 3 million households have rooftop solar and sales of medium-sized electric cars are surging.  But as we work towards fully electric households powered by renewable energy, have we overlooked a key enabling technology, the humble electric water heater?  About half of Australian households use electric water heaters, while the rest use gas. So what's so great about electric water heaters? Electric water heaters offer a cheap way to store large amounts of energy, in the form of hot water. A heater with a 300-litre tank can store about as much energy as a second-generation Tesla Powerwall - at a fraction of the cost. Our research at the UTS Institute for Sustainable Futures has found Australians could use household electric water heaters to store as much energy as over two million home batteries of that kind.  This could eventually save over AUSD 6 billion a year on our energy bills while getting us closer to net-zero carbon emissions.  Our report, published today and funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), recommends that, to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, we urgently need policies to rapidly replace gas water heaters with  smart  electric water heaters. Smart heaters can be switched on and off in response to changes in electricity supply and demand across the grid.  This means these heaters can soak up excess  off-peak  renewable energy, particularly from solar, and so help us solve two key problems at once. They can help reduce and eventually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. And they can make our electricity grid more stable by providing flexible demand that helps balance out the fluctuating supply from renewable sources.  Cutting emissions There are three main types of electric water heater. A conventional  resistance  heater uses electricity to heat water directly. Solar water heaters use sunlight and electricity, but have become less popular as newer  heat pump  units emerged.  These collect heat from the air and  pump  it into water. A heat pump uses three to four times less electricity than a resistance heater.  Back in 2010, a resistance electric water heater typically produced around four times more emissions than its gas equivalent. Heat pump emissions were about the same as for gas. That's because electric water heaters use a lot of electricity, and most of it came from burning coal.  As we generate more electricity from renewables, this picture is changing dramatically.  Australia's energy market operator, AEMO, publishes regularly updated pathways to a clean-energy future. In the most likely outcome, the  step-change scenario , gas will become the most greenhouse-intensive water-heating option by 2030.  By 2040, once the transition to a renewable electricity system is largely complete, emissions from resistance and heat pump water heaters will be much lower than for their gas counterparts.  Water heaters can last 15 years or more. So the stock of heaters in our homes for the next two decades depends on what we install today. Replacing gas heaters with electric heaters should therefore be an immediate priority in our energy transition.  Our work explored a range of scenarios, each with a different mix of water-heating technologies. One was a business-as-usual baseline where gas water heaters remain prevalent. In alternative scenarios gas is phased out over the next 10-20 years.  We found that replacing gas with electric water heating would not only help us get to net-zero emissions sooner, it would save us money.  Gas is expensive and unlikely to get much cheaper. Abundant renewables offer an excess of cheap electricity that water heaters can help soak up. Embracing this opportunity could save over $6 billion a year on our energy bills by 2040.  Boosting grid stability Solar and wind are now the cheapest technologies we've ever had for generating electricity. But to maintain a stable electricity system, we need to match demand with the fluctuating supply from renewable sources. Batteries offer a partial solution, but are still relatively costly.  Electric water heaters offer a much cheaper way to store large amounts of energy and provide the demand flexibility the grid needs.  Our research found that, compared to the business-as-usual baseline, a scenario that emphasises demand flexibility using smart electric water heaters could provide an extra 30GWh of daily flexible demand capacity.  That's the equivalent of over 2 million home batteries across the National Electricity Market, which supplies electricity to eastern and southern Australia.  Back to the future for water heating Since the 1950s,  off-peak hot water  has seen Australian electricity providers turning household water heaters off during the day and on at night to better match demand and supply. In return, customers received heavily discounted prices.  In recent decades we've moved away from off-peak electric hot water, as incentives dwindled and more homes connected to natural gas.  As we electrify our hot water, which technology should we embrace: resistance or heat pump? The answer is both.  Our research explored the trade-off between highly flexible resistance water heaters versus highly efficient but less flexible heat pumps.  Heat pumps use less electricity and cost less to run. Where electricity prices are high or power flow is limited, using heat pumps makes sense. However, they have a higher upfront cost and are not suited to all homes. Many apartments, for example, lack access to suitable outdoor space.  And because they use less electricity, heat pumps offer less flexible demand. As renewables, particularly solar, increasingly power our grid, the ability of resistance electric heaters to soak up excess  off-peak  renewable energy is a big advantage.  With the right policies and market reforms, we will all benefit from a system that once again rewards customers with cheap off-peak electricity in exchange for network operators being able to switch our water heaters off and on as needed.

The cost of an alkaline electrolyzer can be potentially halved with some technological and economic innovations, said Bharat L Newalkar, chief general manager (R&D), BPCL.The company plans to get a third party to set up the electrolyzer-making facility, he said, adding that the alkaline electrolyzers produced from the proposed facility will likely cost 20-30% less than the current rate of about $800 per kw.About 55 kwh of renewable electricity is needed to produce a kilogram of green hydrogen. To make green hydrogen viable, capital, as well as operating expenditure, must go down, said Ravikumar V, head of R&D at BPCL. Innovation, as well as government support, would be needed to reduce green hydrogen costs, he added. Producing green hydrogen costs triple that of grey hydrogen today.Most state-run refiners are planning to begin production of green hydrogen to partly replace the heavy volume of grey hydrogen they mainly use for removing sulphur from the fuel.BPCL\u2019s R&D division has also designed a more efficient LPG cooking stove burner that can help save a cylinder's worth of gas every year for a household, said Ravikumar. Stoves in the market have a fuel efficiency of 68% while the BPCL\u2019s new model has an efficiency of 74%. Both burners cost the same. More than 70,000 stoves using BPCL\u2019s burners have already been sold to customers, he said.",

        "articleBody": "State-owned project consultancy company Engineers India Ltd (EIL) is eyeing renewable energy projects as well as overseas market as it pivots shift from the construction of fossil-fuel plants for its next phase of growth, its chairman and managing director Vartika Shukla said. Starting in 1965 as an answer to cut reliance on foreign companies for doing engineering and other work for the massive projects that a newly independent nation undertook, EIL is building the country's first biorefinery, which will use bamboo to produce ethanol, and moving into green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. The company is also looking at projects overseas particularly in the Middle East and Africa. While oil will continue to exist for the next few decades, we are preparing for life after oil in a world looking at transition,  she said. From bringing technology for upgrade of petrol and diesel to Euro-VI (BS-VI) emission specifications, to upgrade of oil refineries, petrochemical integration and niche chemicals, EIL has in recent times added biofuels and green hydrogen to the list of industries where it provides consultancy right from design and feasibility studies to engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance. EIL has also started giving engineering and construction consultancy for fertilizer plants as it believes the demand for crop nutrients will always be there. It has also entered the infrastructure segment and is providing consultancy for airport building. From preparing a feasibility report for setting up a bamboo-based biorefinery project in Assam to giving consultancy services for the Jewar airport being built outside Delhi, EIL is building capabilities outside of the fossil fuels, she said adding the firm is also doing data centre projects, Leh Airport, Fintech University & Technological Park, Horticulture Marketing and restoration of heritage buildings. It is also providing technology support and consultancy services for production of bio-ATF for MRPL, she said. EIL is doing technological tie-ups like a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) it has signed with German firm Deep for building salt cavern storages of crude oil. Projects at hand include expansion of the Vizag oil refinery, building a new highly-petrochemical intensive oil refinery at Barmer in Rajasthan, and one of the biggest petrochemical integration projects of HPCL Mittal Energy Ltd at Bhatinda in Punjab. Overseas, it provided consultancy for the Dangote oil refinery project in Nigeria having total capital outlay of almost USD 20 billion with the highest single train refining capacity in the world. The company is also providing project management consultancy (PMC) services for a 1.5 million tonnes Mongol refinery project in Mongolia, she said. Recently, EIL expanded its business in Guyana securing a 300 MW power plant project, she said adding EIL has strengthened its office in Abu Dhabi to cater to projects in the entire region. EIL has also worked on data centres for State Bank of India, IIM Nagpur campus, and restoration of heritage sites like Khajuraho and Sun temple of Konark in Odisha. EIL has also marked its footprint in the biofuels project's implementation. It is providing its services in the implementation of one of the largest capacities biorefinery project in India for Assam Biorefinery Pvt Ltd and is playing a crucial role in providing technological solutions for decarbonizing the aviation sector in collaboration with CSIR-IIP, Dehradun.  We want to be a global leader offering total solutions. ",

        "articleBody": "Coal may provide a potential new way to store hydrogen gas, much like batteries store energy for future use, addressing a major hurdle in developing a clean energy supply chain, according to a study. Hydrogen is a clean burning fuel and shows promise for use in the most energy intensive sectors of the economy-transportation, electricity generation and manufacturing, the researchers said.  However, much work remains to build a hydrogen infrastructure and make it an affordable and reliable energy source, they said. This includes developing a way to store hydrogen, which is currently expensive and inefficient.   We found that coal can be this geological hydrogen battery,  said Shimin Liu, associate professor of energy and mineral engineering at Penn State, US.   You could inject and store the hydrogen energy and have it there when you need to use it,  Liu said.  Geologic formations are an intriguing option, the scientists said, because they can store large amounts of hydrogen to meet the peaks and valleys as energy demand changes daily or seasonally.   Coal is well-studied, and we have been commercially producing gas from coal for almost a half century. We understand it. We have the infrastructure. I think coal would be the logical place to do geological hydrogen storage,  Liu said.  The study, published in the journal Applied Energy, analysed eight types of coals from coalfields across the US to better understand their sorption and diffusion potential, or how much hydrogen they can hold.  Sorption is a phenomenon of capture of a gas or a vapour (sorbate) by a substance in condensed state (solid or liquid) called sorbent.  All eight coals showed considerable sorption properties, with low-volatile bituminous coal from eastern Virgina and anthracite coal from eastern Pennsylvania performing the best in tests, the researchers said.   I think it's highly possible that coal could be the very top selection for geological storage from a scientific perspective,  said Liu.   We find that coal outperforms other formations because it can hold more, it has existing infrastructure and is widely available,  he added.  Depleted coalbed methane reservoirs may be the best candidates. These contain unconventional natural gas like methane and have become an important source of fossil fuel energy over the last several decades, the researchers said. The methane sticks to the surface of the coal, in a process called adsorption, they said.",

In the nearly 50-minute talks on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Modi and Kishida also deliberated on ways to synergise efforts to combat pressing global challenges under India's G20 presidency and Japan's leadership of the G7 advanced economies. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the two prime ministers exchanged views on a wide range of issues, including development finance, food security, climate change and energy among others.  The leaders discussed ways to synergise efforts of their respective G-20 and G-7 presidencies. The prime minister stressed the need to highlight the concerns and priorities of the Global South,  the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said. The group of seven, comprising the US, France, the UK, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan, represent the world's richest democracies. Under its G7 presidency, Japan invited India and seven other countries to the summit. In a tweet, Modi described his meeting with Kishida as  excellent   We reviewed the full range of India-Japan relations and also discussed the focus areas of India's G-20 Presidency and Japan's G-7 Presidency towards making our planet better,  the prime minister said. In a statement, the MEA said the two prime ministers also discussed deepening cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, ways to combat terrorism and the reform of the United Nations.  The two leaders exchanged views on contemporary regional developments. They also discussed deepening cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,  it said.  The leaders agreed on ways to further strengthen the bilateral Special Strategic and Global Partnership. Discussions focused on areas of education, skill development, tourism, Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE), green hydrogen, high technology, semiconductors and digital public infrastructure,  it said. It was the second meeting between Modi and Kishida this year following the visit of the Japanese prime minister to India in March this year. A Japanese readout said Modi and Kishida welcomed the increasingly active defence exchanges since the second Japan-India '2+2' defence and foreign ministerial dialogue held in September last year.  The two leaders exchanged views on a wide range of issues, including development finance, food security, climate and energy, and confirmed their commitment to discuss and work together on various issues in the international community in the lead-up to both the G7 and G20 summits,  it said. The two leaders welcomed the steady progress made toward the 5-trillion-yen target of public and private investment and financing from Japan to India in the next five years, which was set in March last year. The readout said Modi and Kishida welcomed the signing of a 300-billion-yen loan for the project for the construction of high-speed rail and confirmed that they will continue cooperation in promoting the high-speed rail project.  The two leaders also confirmed that they would continue cooperation on the development of the North-eastern region of India, through the Japan-India Act East Forum,  it said. The MEA said Modi thanked Kishida for planting in Hiroshima the Bodhi sapling that had been gifted by Modi to him in March this year.  The prime minister recalled that the Indian Parliament commemorated every year the Hiroshima Day, and noted that Japanese diplomats were always present on the occasion,  it said. Modi arrived in Hiroshima on Friday to attend three sessions at the G7 summit following an invitation by Kishida.",

        "articleBody": "The environment ministry has exempted all pumped storage hydropower (PSHP) projects from environment impact assessment regime, citing 'lesser' impact on the environment and their 'critical' role in ensuring India's growing energy storage and infrastructure development needs.PSHPs are essentially a combination of two different water reservoirs placed at different elevations and with a turbine in between which allows generation of power as water rushes down from one reservoir to the other. It is considered more efficient and often termed a 'giant battery' as this system can store power and release it when required.The move comes three months after the power ministry announced an 18 Giga Watt target for PSHP to meet India's growing energy and development needs. It also pitched for tax breaks for PSHP besides a 'rationalised' green clearance regime for them in the draft norms issued for PSHPs in February.So far, all PSHPs have been considered as conventional hydropower projects and the full scrutiny of the environmental clearance process is applied to them. The ministry has now held that the environmental impact of these are 'less as compared to classical hydro projects as well as irrigation and water supply projects' and hence there is now a 'need to rationalise environmental clearance process for Pump Storage projects'.The MoEF has said in a notification issued on Friday that in view of commitment for 'low carbon pathway of development', it is necessary to have a smooth integration of renewable energy in the grid and to have greater grid safety and stability. There is a growing need for energy storage and thereby the development of pumped storage projects is critical,  it has stated.It has, accordingly, notified River Valley hydro electric projects with pump storage and standalone pump storage projects as 'B2 category' irrespective of their power generation capacity.This, essentially, means that all such projects will now be exempted from the EIA and public hearing process- both rigorous and detailed processes to ensure environmental impact of major projects is minimised and mitigated.Environmentalists, however, have pointed out that even though these are not conventional hydro power projects, there will still be considerable environmental impact where the reservoirs come up as some degree of submergence will be involved affecting the flora, fauna and inhabitants in the vicinity.The power ministry in its February 2023 draft guidelines had termed the process of environmental clearance and forest clearance as one of the key 'barriers in the development of pumped storage projects'. It had said that the process was 'cumbersome' since these projects are treated at par with the conventional hydro projects for the purpose of grant of EC and FC.",

        "articleBody": "India has set a deadline of 2035 to establish green hydrogen bunkering and refuelling facilities at major ports in the drive to cut its carbon footprint, the shipping ministry said in guidelines issued on Wednesday. One of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, India aims to cut emissions to net zero by 2070, and the shipping minister said three of its ports would initially have bunker facilities for green hydrogen and ammonia.  Our target is to cover all 12 major parts with a green hydrogen bunkering facility by 2035,  Shipping Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told Reuters. The initial ports in the effort are to be Paradip in the east, Kandla in the west, and Tuticorin in the south.  Financing required to turn these ports into green ports is under consideration,  Sonowal added. More than 200 ports dot India's coastline, which stretches 7,500 km (4,660 miles), in addition to the 12 major ones, all together accounting for 95% of its trade by volume and 65% by value. Authorities want electricity to power at least half the vehicle and equipment needs of major ports by 2030, rather than diesel, and raise that figure further to 90% by 2047.  Whatever initiative we are taking aims to meet the 2070 goal of being a net-zero carbon nation,  Sonowal said. To meet the net-zero goal, at least 40% of India's electricity will have to come from renewables. To that end, the new shipping guidelines require ports to satisfy at least 60% of electricity needs through renewables by 2030 and 90% by 2047. Also, by 2030, all ports must achieve cuts of more than a fifth in energy consumption on each tonne of cargo versus 2023, the guidelines show. To boost use of gas, the shipping ministry wants ports to set up at least one liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering station by 2030 and electric vehicle charging stations in and around port areas by 2025.

Of this, Hindustan Petroleum is planning to have 115 MW capacity at its refineries in Visakhapatnam and Barmer. Gas pipeline operator GAIL is targeting a capacity of 60 MW while Indian Oil, the nation\u2019s largest refiner, aims to develop a capacity of 56 MW at its Mathura and Panipat refineries.Bharat Petroleum is targeting 25 MW capacity while Numaligarh Refinery and Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals are aiming for 20 MW and 3 MW respectively.India is placing a big thrust on green hydrogen in its energy transition plan. It aims to develop green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 million metric tonnes per annum by 2030, which would involve an investment of Rs 8 lakh crore.State-run oil and gas companies are expected to play a key role in setting up green hydrogen capacity since they are already a big producer and consumer of non-green hydrogen. Hydrogen producing capacity of state-run and private-sector refiners is projected to rise 85% to 2.5 million tonnes per annum by 2030 from 1.4 million tonnes per annum in 2020, according to the transition committee report. Indian Oil is projected to have the highest capacity of 825,000 tonnes per annum by 2030. Reliance Industries is projected to have a capacity of 529,000 tonnes per annum and HPCL of 302,000 tonnes per annum.In India, 99% of the total demand for pure hydrogen comes from refineries and fertilizer makers. Indian refiners use about 2.1 million tonnes of hydrogen, and the ammonia sector uses about 3.1 million tonnes annually, according to the committee.About 20 green hydrogen projects exist or have been announced across the world with a combined capacity of about 230 GW, according to the committee.The challenges for scaling up the green hydrogen market include cost, technology maturity, efficiency, renewable electricity, and regulatory uncertainty, the committee said.",

The IBA urged the petroleum and natural gas ministry to extend the CBG-CGD (city gas distribution) synchronisation scheme for at least a decade to offer long-term certainty to CBG firms and support investment decisions.

        "articleBody": "The Indian Biogas Association (IBA) has pitched for increasing the share of compressed biogas in total gas mix, saying it will help reduce the country's annual import bill by USD 20-25 billion by 2030. In a letter to Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri recently, IBA suggested that in the process of attaining a gas-based economy by 2030, the oil ministry has to keep a strict vigil on the overall sustainability.  The industry body suggested gradually increasing the share of compressed biogas (CBG) in the overall gas mix to at least 10 per cent by 2025 and to 20 per cent in 2030.  Furthermore, the CBG-CGD (city gas distribution) synchronization plan, which was launched in April 2021 and is due for review three years later (in 2024), should be extended for at least ten years to provide long-term certainty to players in the CBG ecosystem, it suggested.  Increasing the share of CBG will ensure guaranteed offtake and a transparent ecosystem for CBG producers.  It will also help fast-track setting up of CBG plants under the SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) scheme, as biogas plant owners will see the value proposition for their investments, it pointed out.  For instance, it stated that the ethanol blending programme in petrol has gone up from 1.5 per cent in 2014 to 10 per cent now.  By 2030, the annual import bill reductions of the government shall be USD 20-25 billion (at the current LNG spot price level), and Green House Gas (GHG) reductions shall be 150 million tonne, roughly 10 per cent reduction at 2005 GHG emissions level.  IBA stated that the relaxed domestic 'gas pricing move' must go hand-in-hand with the environmental sustainability goals set by the renewable energy ministry -- 45 per cent reduction in emission intensity by 2030 and net-zero emission by 2070.  Particularly for the CBG industry, wherein the offtake price of CBG is benchmarked to its closest substitute, CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), the move turns out to be a deterrent, it stated.  For the CBG industry, it is like taking one step backward after a few forward moves like exemption of central excise duty on the onward sale of CBG blended with CNG; resumption of the MNRE subsidy programme; introduction of the BIS standards on design, construction, and operation of biogas plants , and others, IBA said.  The CGD companies claim to have been heavily bled with regard to margins in the previous few months, owing to higher domestic gas prices. Amid the global uncertainty, the domestic gas price rose to USD 8 per MMBTU from USD 1.6 per MMBTU(Million British Thermal Units) last year.  Now with the recent government gas pricing notification to trim and cap gas domestic prices, it becomes even more unfavourable to procure CBG, it stated.  The procurement price gap of CBG and domestic gas shall widen further, it opined.  In addition, under the CGD-CBG synchronization scheme formulated by gas utility major GAIL (India) Ltd, the pricing associated with compression charges and transport charges over and above the UBP (uniform base price) of CBG is even more concerning for the CGD players who are willing to procure CBG into its gas mix, it stated.  The compression charges are going to increase further, as the PNGRB (Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board) has written to BIS (Bureau of Indian Standard) to increase methane from 90 to 95 per cent, needing an additional hike in the price of CBG, it stated.  A roadmap can be set to introduce progressive blending targets going forward which shall be in harmony with CGD companies adopting sustainable growth paths and a gas-based economy set forth by the government, it suggested.",

        "articleBody": "The UK and India are set to become first movers in the transition to Net Zero transport systems, thanks to a pioneering innovation partnership, led by Energy Systems Catapult. Innovating for Transport and Energy Systems (ITES) is a unique collaboration to develop greener, quicker and more affordable ways for people and goods to move around \u2013 in India, the UK, and beyond, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), a partner institution, said in a press release.Backed by governments in both the UK and India, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), and delivered in partnership with the IISc, the initiative will for the first time bring together innovators, industry heavyweights, researchers, policymakers and investors from both countries to target the transport system\u2019s toughest decarbonisation challenges, such as developing an electric vehicle-ready infrastructure. The initiative is one of the first to be announced following a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by UK and India Science Ministers on April 26, in Westminster, to boost science and innovation, and deliver economic growth across the two countries. ITES will offer a \u2018soft-landing\u2019 for UK SMEs interested in the Indian market, and opportunities for SMEs and start-ups in India, helping innovators to safely develop, test and export solutions that help decarbonise transport, thanks to low-risk, high-impact pilots with trusted partners. The collaboration will also help SMEs tackle scalability with go-to-market support and access to potential clients, funders and investment. Adopting a perspective across the whole transport and energy system, ITES will consider the multiple solutions needed to deliver cleaner seas, skies, roads and railways. Cutting-edge pilots and research programmes in India and the UK will test technologies and explore pathways for sustainable and clean transport \u2013 such as electric and hydrogen solutions \u2013 that are reliable, affordable and acceptable to businesses and consumers, as well as ensuring an infrastructure and energy generation system that can meet demand. ITES aims to attract public, private and third sector partners and sponsors to ensure activities are market-led and solve practical problems, such as zero-emission fleets and last-mile delivery, and innovative charging technologies. By combining resources, the programme will make it more cost-effective for the UK and India to develop world-first pilot projects and Net Zero solutions. Guy Newey, Chief Executive at Energy Systems Catapult, said: \u201cDecarbonising transport is one of the greatest challenges we face. This is not a hurdle we can overcome alone. By linking innovators, researchers, and investors together in the UK and India we can unlock financial investments, accelerate the pace of decarbonisation, and flex our collective low-carbon muscle. \u201cThe partnership underlines how innovation from SMEs will be at the heart of the Net Zero transition and affords them an opportunity to collaborate and trial their solutions in the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy \u2013 turbocharging decarbonisation efforts and unleashing economic potential.\u201d The initiative will be steered by in-country partner, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Prof Ashish Verma, Convenor, IISc Sustainable Transportation (IST) Lab, said, \u201cIndia is currently passing through an interesting phase of economic growth and infrastructure development in many sectors including transport, which provides a great opportunity for the country to leapfrog to a sustainable and Net Zero future. \u201cWe are committed to exploring disruptive, cutting-edge and collaborative solutions. Complementing these efforts, ITES, which is anchored within the IST lab, will harness the UK and India\u2019s rich reputation for R&D and the strength of our business sectors to pioneer test beds that unlock better data, clearer decision-making and bolder collective action from industry and leaders in the transport and energy sector.\u201d ITES will form part of the new UK-India Net Zero Innovation Virtual Centre, a key coalition forged as part of the Memorandum of Understanding signed last week, to help maximise cooperation on Net Zero action. Backed by the UK Government, the Centre will be facilitated by the UK Science and Innovation Network in India, hosting programmes such as the Hydrogen Valley and Industrial Decarbonisation Living Lab to help decarbonise manufacturing and \u2013 through the ITES initiative \u2013 transport systems. The launch of ITES builds on the success of former initiatives to boost innovation between the UK and India, such as the Innovating for Clean Air (IfCA) programme. Led by Energy Systems Catapult, with partners including the Indian Institute of Science, the programme enabled the adoption of clean EV technologies and services by proving solutions across real-life testbeds in India. Sarah Fallon, Regional Director (India, Middle East), Science, Innovation and Tech, British High Commission, New Delhi said: \u201cOur ambition is that ITES will be a long-term, established base for UK-India superpower partnerships and programmes that shape the future of Net Zero transport systems, and that can be expanded to other sectors over time. \u201cWe are confident that this initiative will help accelerate the development of innovative solutions for greener transport systems in India and overseas, and bring us closer to our shared goal of Net Zero emissions \u2013 an ambition that can only be realised with international collaboration.  London-based business GreenEnco is among the UK innovators that has expanded its offering in India after demonstrating its EV charging station solution, and gaining support to develop a mobile app as part of the project. The company is now applying its expertise to help deliver faster electric vehicle charging solutions in India, while also supporting local industry. GreenEnco Chief Executive Officer Dr Jyotirmoy Roy said: \u201cThrough international programmes such as IfCA, ESC and their partners have provided innovative businesses like ours with the safe springboard we need to develop overseas, opening doors in India to help us collaborate and commercialise across borders. We have now committed with our integrated green energy solution to help develop a fast EV charging infrastructure in India. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that our innovative solution will not only make an environmental impact to help decarbonise the transport sector, but \u2013 with our locally-procured system components \u2013 we are also supporting the development of a sustainable socio-economical ecosystem in India.\u201d ",

        "articleBody": "The president of upcoming UN climate talks Sultan Al Jaber on Tuesday called on participants to drastically ramp up their use of renewable energy ahead of the key summit in the United Arab Emirates later this year.  The meeting in November needs  ambitious, transparent and accountable commitments from countries and businesses , Al Jaber said in a speech at the opening of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, a meeting of climate diplomats in Berlin.  We will accelerate delivery in sectors like renewables that must triple capacity by 2030 and double it again by 2040,  he added. The summit chief's call echoes a key target laid out by the International Energy Agency. Al Jaber had already raised the potential target at a closed-door meeting with G7 leaders in Japan last month. While setting out a goal for faster renewables expansion, Al Jaber, who is also the chief executive of the UAE's state oil company, did not call for a complete end to the use of fossil fuels. Rather, the future COP28 chair said the focus must be on removing the emissions such fuels produce.  We must be laser focused on phasing out fossil fuel emissions, while phasing up viable, affordable zero-carbon alternatives,  said Al Jaber. Climate activists have criticised the decision to hold COP28 in the oil-rich UAE and the choice as COP president of Al Jaber, who also serves as the Gulf state's minister of industry and advanced technology. - Climate fund - Al Jaber also used his speech to call on developed countries to deliver a long promised $100-billion climate package for developing countries.  This is holding up progress. And as part of my outreach, I am requesting donor countries to provide a definitive assessment on the delivery of this commitment before COP28,  Al Jaber said. In 2009, the chaotic UN climate summit in Copenhagen saw rich nations promise $100 billion a year by 2020 to the Global South, but last year the OECD said the amount delivered was still $17 billion short. At the same time, the funding needed for developing countries to stop burning planet-heating fossil fuels and prepare for future climate disasters has already far outstripped that sum. Campaigners are pushing for a redesign of the global financial architecture to help countries cope, as many emerging nations grapple with rising costs, soaring debts and extreme weather events. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who is hosting the Petersberg dialogue, however, reported that the pledged sum may finally be close.  The good news is we are on the way to finally reaching this $100-billion sum this year,  she said. - Protest group - Earlier this year, the UN's climate expert panel said the world risks crossing the key 1.5-degree Celsius global warming limit in about a decade, urging a drastic reduction in planet-heating emissions. While solar and wind power are already increasing dramatically, the UN report said that existing fossil fuel infrastructure will be enough to push the world beyond 1.5C, without the effective use of costly and emerging technology to capture and store the carbon pollution. The meeting in Berlin came as the German capital was roiled by days of climate protests, with the action continuing Tuesday.  Campaigners from the Last Generation group have caused widespread disruption in the city by sticking themselves to the road surface to stop traffic and agitate for more climate protection. Among other measures, Last Generation has called for the government to provide a  detailed plan  to meet the goal of a 1.5C-limit and introduce a general speed limit. Representatives from the group met Germany's Transport Minister Volker Wissing on Tuesday. Wissing said on radio Deutschlandfunk that he was surprised the activists  make so few sensible suggestions for climate protection and at the same time act so radically .",

As India continues to develop at pace, clean energy solutions will play a growing and important role in meeting the country's energy demands, especially in the industrial and hard-to-abate industries that Serentica looks to support,  said Hardik Shah, partner at KKR.The additional investment from KKR will help Serentica scale up its power supply agreements with three Vedanta group companies, from existing 3 billion units of renewable power annually to 9 billion units. In March 2022, Serentica was formed and it signed PDAs (power delivery agreements) with three Vedanta companies engaged in the metals and mining space to supply 3 billion units of renewable power annually,  said Pratik Agarwal, director, Serentica Renewables. Then over the course of the following six months, all the three units expressed their desire to procure more renewable energy as they were facing coal shortages and they were getting ready for the EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism to kick in from January 2026 and they felt that they must take advantage of ISTS waiver available till June 2025. So, we signed additional contracts of 6 billion units, taking the total contract to 9 billion units annually. With this additional supply, Vedanta will decarbonise 20% of its energy base, which makes it one of the most aggressive decarbonisation exercise by any natural resource company in the world, added Agarwal.For the supply of 9 billion units of green power, Serentica is setting up close to 4,000 MW of renewable energy generation capacity, of which 60% will come from solar and 40% from wind energy. The solar plants will be located in Rajasthan and Karnataka, while the wind farms will be located in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.",

        "articleBody": "EU lawmakers and member state governments have reached agreement on boosting  green  aviation fuels at airports to cut carbon emissions, officials said Wednesday.The preliminary deal would see a minimum two percent of sustainable aviation fuel -- synthetic, biofuel, or recycled from waste gases and plastic -- mixed into currently used kerosene starting from 2025, rising gradually to 70 percent by 2050.The agreement is part of the European Union's transition to a net carbon-neutral future, and follows a sweeping reform of the bloc's carbon market that is expanded to include sea and air transport.The European Commission said the drive to increase sustainable aviation fuels would cut aircraft carbon dioxide emissions by two-thirds by 2050. This agreement provides certainty for the SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) industry and airlines alike,  the head of aviation industry group Airlines for Europe, Laurent Donceel, said.But he added that Brussels needs to support the transition to sustainable aviation fuels in the same way it backs the adoption of solar panels and wind turbines so it is  not pricing passengers out of the air .Aviation emissions in Europe were on an upward curve of around five percent per year between 2013 and 2019, dropping off after that only because of travel curbs under the coronavirus pandemic. Those curbs are now largely lifted, and aviation traffic is bouncing back.The European Parliament and the European Council, which represents member states, have to formally adopt the measure before it is published as a new EU law.",

        "articleBody": "Hydropower companies face the prospects of a dent to their financials due to the new water usage cess imposed by the Himachal Pradesh government in March, multiple industry executives and experts ET spoke with said.JSW, GMR, Statkraft and Greenko are among private sector players likely to be affected. A total of 172 projects in the state have to pay for the water that flows through their plants to generate electricity. According to industry insiders, the impact is expected to be two-pronged. Functional projects are expected to see a sharp rise in operating costs - by up to 25%. Under-construction projects will have to renegotiate terms with bankers for financing because the underlying financial projections on the basis of which those loans were granted have changed.None of the potentially affected companies responded to ET\u2019s mailed queries until the publication of this report.\u201cIn some cases, power purchase agreements may factor in changes of law clauses. In those cases, the additional cost of generation will be passed on to the distributor and ultimately make power expensive for the end-user,\u201d a top executive at one of the affected companies said, on the condition of anonymity. \u201cHowever, where the contracts don\u2019t have such protective clauses, the financial impact could make the project unviable\u201d, a top executive at one of the impacted companies said on condition of anonymity.According to banking sources, GMR\u2019s 180-megawatt project at Bajoli Holi in Himachal Pradesh sells power to industrial customers such as UP Power Corporation and Delhi International Airport. There are no clauses for change in law events in its contracts and it would be unable to re-negotiate tariffs and pass on additional costs.Similarly, sources said that Statkraft\u2019s project at Malana in Himachal Pradesh operates on a merchant power contract with PTC India. There is no room for re-negotiating tariffs. The company has two other projects in the state with capacities of around 150 megawatts and 192 megawatts. They are also likely to be affected.Greenko and JSW Group have under-construction projects with capacities of around 500 megawatts and 240 megawatts, respectively. Financing terms on those under-construction projects could be affected because the cost structure has changed.\u201cThey should not have imposed the water usage cess. They are already charging generators by making them provide 12% of power generated by them free to the state. In addition, they are levying 1% as local area development charges,\u201d said MM Madan, Jindal Steel\u2019s former hydropower chief.Hydropower experts believe the policy change is expected to impact investor appetite in the sector.\u201cThe viability will be reduced. Therefore, investments will reduce,\u201d said Awadh Giri, head of Confederation of Indian Industry\u2019s hydropower committee.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: NTPC plans to raise funds through an initial public offering (IPO) for its green energy unit NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) in this financial year, after Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) withdrew its offer for a 20% stake in the unit, said people in the know. The IPO will be on a book building basis,  said one of the persons.Petronas had pipped REC Ltd and Indraprastha Gas Ltd for the stake in a bidding last month, according to people privy to the information. After getting the final bids, there were further negotiations to up the value, but the (highest) bidder retracted it,  the person said.  99474552Petronas did not respond to ET's queries till press time.NTPC plans to monetise assets of about \u20b96,000 crore in FY24, the person said. The plan includes NGEL's IPO.On March 17, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had approved increasing NTPC's investment in NGEL above the prescribed limit of \u20b95,000 crore for a maharatna company in its subsidiary.However, the person said, it is not as if NTPC will not look for strategic investors for NGEL in future.Around 15 renewable energy assets of NTPC were transferred to NGEL towards the end of 2022-23. NGEL will drive India's largest power producer's ambitious clean energy programmes. The company will have subsidiaries and joint ventures to carry out the projects.NTPC aims to have 60 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2032 on a standalone basis and 130 GW on consolidated level. The company is also working on nuclear power, green hydrogen, e-mobility and waste-to-wealth projects. Of the 60 GW, 40 GW would be through tariff-based competitive bidding, which would include bundling for round-the-clock power, NTPC earlier said.India has committed to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 and achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by the same timeline. It also plans to have 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based installed capacity by 2030. With a share of 17% of the installed capacity, NTPC contributes nearly 24% of the total electricity produced in India.",

        "articleBody": "State-run power giant NTPC Ltd. is considering seeking fresh offers for a stake in its green unit after the top bidder pulled out, a development that highlights the challenges the nation faces in rapidly developing its renewables industry to meet climate goals.Malaysian oil major Petroliam Nasional Bhd. made the highest offer of nearly 41.3 billion rupees ($503 million) for a 20% stake in NTPC Green Energy Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter. But Petronas later retracted the bid, saying the stake was too small and won\u2019t give it a seat on the unit\u2019s board, the people said, asking not to be named as the discussions are private.Petronas\u2019s bid would have valued NTPC Green at about 206.5 billion rupees.NTPC and Petronas declined to comment.The difficulties of India\u2019s largest power producer to find an investor spotlight the issues that have slowed India\u2019s efforts in adding capacity to its renewables industry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s bid to champion domestic manufacturing has created trade barriers that are hampering development of renewables projects and raising costs. Rising interest rates have also made capital more expensive.In addition, soaring demand and attractive subsidies for clean energy in developed markets, such as the US and the European Union, is weaning some investors away from India. Climate GoalsIndia is aiming for the share of clean sources in the nation\u2019s power-generation capacity to surge to 90% by 2047 \u2014 more than double from now \u2014 to meet its climate goals, federal Power Secretary Alok Kumar said earlier this month.NTPC\u2019s tender offer last year drew initial interest from 13 companies, including Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. Of these, only three companies \u2014 Petronas, Indian power lender REC Ltd. and gas retailer Indraprastha Gas Ltd. \u2014 put in final bids.Spokespersons at REC and Indraprastha Gas didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.The fiscal year ended in March was expected to be a significant milestone for NTPC Green, the face of transition for the country\u2019s biggest coal consumer. The company had decided to rope in a marquee investor and follow it up with an initial public offer during the year. Neither of those plans came to fruition. NTPC is emerging as one of the leading champions of energy transition in the country, with investments planned in renewable energy parks, green hydrogen and electric-vehicle charging systems. The New Delhi-based company still runs nearly 90% of its 72 gigawatts generation capacity on fossil fuels. It plans to expand capacity to 130 gigawatts by 2032, with clean energy making up for almost half of that target.",

        "articleBody": "Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd., a closely held utility of Adani Transmission Ltd., said it\u2019s on course to procure as much as 60% of its power supply from renewable sources by 2027, reiterating the Indian conglomerate\u2019s broader commitment to deploy and produce more green energy.Renewables accounted for 30% of power procurement for Adani Electricity as of March 31 \u2014 a ten-fold jump over the last two years, the company said in a presentation to stock exchanges Wednesday. The utility, which provides electricity to some part of the country\u2019s financial capital, said it aims by 2027 to be \u201camongst the few globally\u201d to source a significant share from renewables.The pivot is part of its billionaire-owner Gautam Adani\u2019s larger ambitions to invest $70 billion by 2030 across the green energy value chain as the first-generation entrepreneur rapidly diversifies his ports-to-power conglomerate beyond its coal trading origins. While a shortseller attack earlier this year has applied brakes on many of Adani\u2019s growth plans, Bloomberg reported last month that green energy remains one of the group\u2019s core focus areas.Adani Electricity\u2019s working capital loans more than halved to Rs 500 crore ($60.9 million) as of March 31 compared to the preceding three months, according to its presentation. The firm\u2019s \u201czero dependence on imported coal\u201d was one of the factors contributing its cost efficiency, it added.Regulatory BoostThe utility also got a boost from a favorable end-March order by the Maharashtra\u2019s power regulator \u2014 the state where Mumbai is based \u2014 which allows it to raise tariffs by 2.2% in the current fiscal year that started this month and by 2.1% in the following year. Power utilities are supposed to charge a regulator-approved tariff to users but electricity supply costs often exceed that. Such shortfalls in revenue then sit in the company\u2019s books as assets for future compensation.Adani Electricity also got the regulator\u2019s nod to recover this deficit accumulated over the last three years via higher tariffs from consumers, although the firm didn\u2019t say how long it would take to recover this in its presentation filed to exchanges. The \u201cregulatory outcome could lower leverage, both for itself and parent, Adani Transmission,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Analyst Sharon Chen wrote in a note Wednesday. \u201cThe regulator has allowed for a recovery of most of its revenue shortfall, with the utility set to receive 15.7 billion rupees in the next two years.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "To address its dependence on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and save on its ever rising fuel bill, India may soon see the launch of a cooking stove run on bio-ethanol.State-run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), in association with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, has developed an ethanol-fuel cooking stove, which could see a pilot launch soon.Ethanol is a green fuel produced by the fermentation of sugar or food grains.HPCL also plans to launch ethanol ATMs (automated teller machines) for users to procure ethanol in canisters for the stove. These ATMs could be positioned at HPCL's retail outlets, industry executives aware of the development said.HPCL declined comment. Ethanol is in ample supply and as India scales up its ethanol blending target with petrol, the supply would increase. It is only good that we use ethanol as a cooking fuel too and save on LPG import bills. It is green and cheap,  said an industry executive aware of HPCL's plans.HPCL, however, wouldn't be the first to launch an ethanol-fuel stove.KoKo Networks, a venture-backed climate-tech company in East Africa and India, is already building and deploying ethanol fuel stoves for the multi-billion dollar market for cooking fuel, which delivers significant cost savings.According to Koko Networks' LinkedIn profile, it operates a state of the art manufacturing facility at Sanand, Ahmedabad, which makes KoKo's flagship product, the two-burner clean fuel ethanol cook stove and canister. Till last month, the company was hiring in India to scale up manufacturing to 2-2.5x capacity over the next two years. Across East Africa and India, it employs 1,200+ employees.Currently, India has an ethanol capacity of over 10 billion litres. By the end of 2023, the country will have 12.5 billion litres plus.India has doubled ethanol blending with petrol to 10% in the last two years. Ethanol blending will reach 12% this year and meet the target of 20% by 2025. Of total ethanol production, 65% comes from molasses-based distilleries. Ethanol is also produced using non-edible agricultural waste left over after harvesting. This includes corn cobs, rice straw and wheat straw, which is converted into cellulose and later fermented to form ethanol, which in turn can be blended with petrol.",

        "articleBody": "India plans to give green hydrogen fuel producers incentives worth at least 10% of their costs under a $2 billion scheme set to begin before the end of June, a top government official said. New Delhi this year approved a 174.9 billion rupee incentive plan to promote green hydrogen in a bid to cut carbon dioxide emissions and become a major exporter in the sector. The government will give incentives worth at least 30 Indian rupees per kilogram (kg) for production of green hydrogen fuel, the official, who is directly involved but did not want to be identified because the discussions are private, told Reuters. The cost of manufacturing green hydrogen, which is made using renewable energy rather than power derived from fossil fuels, in India is currently at about 300 rupees per kilogram.  Of the total incentive plan for the sector, the government will award about 130 billion rupees for producing green hydrogen and rest will be for manufacturing electrolysers, which are used to split hydrogen and oxygen molecules using electricity. India has set targets for half of its installed electricity capacity to be from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 and for the country to attain net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Press Information Bureau did not immediately respond when asked for comment on the scheme by Reuters. The government will start the bidding for firms seeking incentives before the end of this quarter, the source said, adding that the incentives will be tapered every year and the government expects to support 3.6 million tonnes of hydrogen production capacity in the next three years under the scheme. The government will invite bids in three tranches for green hydrogen supply and in two tranches for electrolysers, the official said, adding that this will help gain market insights and to absorb new technologies and realise cost reductions. The auction for green hydrogen supply is expected to be open to companies which have renewable energy plants or produce hydrogen and ammonia. Companies seeking the lowest incentive will be awarded the contracts, the source said. Indian companies such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, Adani Enterprises, JSW Energy, ReNew Power and Acme Solar that have already announced plans for green hydrogen are expected to be interested in the contracts.  Each tranche for manufacturing of electrolysers is likely to be for 1,500 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with the incentive fixed at 4,440 rupees per kilowatt, the official said.  The government expects to support about 3,000 megawatts of annual electrolyser capacity for five years through the scheme, with the first tranches in this quarter and the next in the third quarter of 2023.",

Each of the three phases for green hydrogen will bid out 400,000 tonnes per year capacity with a single bidder getting a maximum 150,000 tonnes per year.Bidders will have to quote production capacity and the minimum incentive required.The auction tranches for green hydrogen have been divided over two financial years to take advantage of technology improvement, demand development and cost cuts. To promote different green hydrogen production pathways, the government may call separate technology-specific bids as required.Electrolysers manufacturing The bidders will be evaluated on committed specific energy consumption of the electrolysers produced and local value addition.To be eligible for incentives under the scheme, the specific energy consumption of an electrolyser must not exceed 56 kWh per kg of hydrogen.

        "articleBody": "India is opposed to diluting the definition of green hydrogen to include fuel produced from low carbon energy, as some developed nations have proposed in G20 meetings, Power and Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said.  In an interview with Reuters, Singh said India, which holds the rotating presidency of the G20, has proposed  harmonisation of the best possible standards  to regulate trade in green hydrogen, which should be produced using only renewable energy, rather than low carbon fuel.  Why should countries, which have been preaching the virtues of energy transition and de-carbonisation, back something called low carbon. It's either clean or not clean,  he said.  Hydrogen, made by electrolysis plants that split water, can be used as a fuel. If the energy used to power the plants is renewable, it is called green hydrogen. Singh said the Indian G20 presidency had put forward a draft definition that he considered reasonable and held discussions with various countries.  If the world wants to decarbonise, the world must agree on a definition of green hydrogen. Without harmonisation of standards, you won't have trade,  he said.  The draft definition assumes there would be some unavoidable green house gas emissions from the overall production process, including from the necessary equipment.  It proposes setting a limit of 1 kilogram CO2 equivalent for every kilogram of green hydrogen produced and the energy source for producing the hydrogen must be entirely renewable, a government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press. Across the world, countries are turning to green hydrogen as a solution to climate-related energy problems.  India in January said it had approved an incentive plan of 174.9 billion rupees ($2.11 billion) to promote green hydrogen to cut emissions and try to become a major exporter in the field. The subject is expected to return to the G20 agenda next month.",

        "articleBody": "Deployment of new wind and solar power plants needs to be drastically ramped up by the end of the decade to meet the world's climate goals, the International Renewable Energy Agency said Tuesday. In an advance preview of its annual report on the global shift from fossil fuels to clean energy, the agency said renewables accounted for 83% of new power generation last year. Worldwide, the share of installed power generation coming from renewables reached 40% in 2022, it said. But in order to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and put the world on track to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), existing targets for renewable power deployment would need to be more than doubled, the Abu Dhabi-based agency said. Governments agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit the global temperature rise to 2 C (3.6 F) - ideally no more than 1.5 C - above pre-industrial averages. The lower target would prevent significant harm from climate change but is increasingly difficult to achieve given that temperatures have already increased by 1.1 C (2 F) since the 19th century and emissions show no sign of dropping fast. Experts say the amount of carbon dioxide and other polluting emissions released into the atmosphere by 2050 shouldn't exceed the amount that can be captured through natural or artificial means.  A profound and systemic transformation of the global energy system must occur in under 30 years,  IRENA Director General Francesco La Camera said at an energy transition conference in Berlin. The agency has estimated that annual public and private investments in renewable energy need to exceed $5 trillion, including for power generation, electrification, transmission grids and efficiency measures. It called for current fossil fuel investments to be diverted to renewable sources and greater financial help for developing countries that are struggling to fund alternatives to coal, oil and gas power plants.",

        "articleBody": "It took less than two weeks for TotalEnergies SE to put a massive green hydrogen project with Adani Group on hold after the Indian conglomerate was rocked by allegations of fraud.The deal \u2014 part of a plan in which billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s clean energy business would have invested $50 billion over the next decade in the emissions-free fuel \u2014 remains in limbo, a victim of Hindenburg Research\u2019s explosive short-seller report.The fallout is unlikely to be limited to the Adani empire. The brouhaha over the business practices of the group \u2014 which became one of the country\u2019s biggest investors in renewable energy after expanding from transport infrastructure \u2014 means there will likely be greater scrutiny of Indian corporate governance across the board.Energy transition investments in India already lag behind other major nations, and now the cost of capital is increasing as global interest rates rise, while the Inflation Reduction Act is creating more opportunities for clean-power investors in the US and its free-trade partners. All that spells trouble for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s goal to put India at the forefront of climate action.  98928134\u201cThe markets are enforcing discipline on companies, including Adani, to reduce debt and bring in equity,\u201d said Shashank Krishna, a London-based partner at law firm Baker Botts LLP, who advises clients on energy and infrastructure deals. \u201cSome projects that are borderline economically viable or may not have a strong business case will have to be shelved or reduced in size.\u201d The multiplying headwinds are making the government\u2019s goal of tripling clean electricity capacity by the end of the decade less achievable. New Delhi wants to increase the current 169 gigawatts to 500 gigawatts by 2030, taking its percentage of the total from 41% to almost two-thirds, a key milestone en route to net zero by 2070. If it falls short of this target, the world\u2019s third-largest emitter will be forced to keep relying on coal for longer. That\u2019s bad news for a fast-warming planet, and also for an Indian economy that\u2019s hoping to lure investment from multinationals that are under pressure to de-carbonize their supply chains. The renewable energy ministry didn\u2019t respond to an emailed request for comment.  98928129While India installed 15 gigawatts of grid-connected wind and solar capacity last year, 44% more than in 2021, it\u2019s still well short of what\u2019s needed to reach the 2030 target. And, ominously for Modi, making a major increase in the level of investment was already proving tough before the Adani crisis. Investment in the deployment of renewable energy technology rose about 4% to $11.5 billion in India last year, but that\u2019s still lower than a recent peak of $12.7 billion in 2017, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF. It\u2019s also a fraction of the $274 billion total in China and $49.5 billion spent in the US.Fiscal incentives such as the IRA are drawing a lot of capital that could have potentially found its way to India, said Anita George, the co-founder of Edhina Capital, an Indian private equity firm looking to invest in clean energy, mobility, green buildings and recycling opportunities. \u201cThat has been a dampener for all the emerging markets, not just India.\u201d India\u2019s unstable policy environment \u2014 with import levies, court orders and doubts over whether the state-level utilities will honor commitments to purchase electricity \u2014 are also giving international investors pause. Indian projects need to offer far higher returns than in less risky destinations to compensate for the uncertainty.   98928120\u201cFrom a global investors perspective, risk-reward in India today seems slightly out of line,\u201d said Pramod Kumar, head of investment banking at Barclays Bank India. If Indian projects offer returns on equity of 11%-12% and debt of 8%, \u201cglobally people are saying given the inflation impact, these returns seem somewhat low,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s affecting some deal activity.\u201dTo meet its 2070 net zero goal, India requires investment of $160 billion annually across its energy sector through 2030, according to the International Energy Agency, roughly triple current levels. With the industry heavily reliant on a handful of local billionaires and mounting hurdles facing international investors, it\u2019s hard to see the country attracting that amount of funding without an aggressive effort from New Delhi to improve its policy settings.\u201cIf you don\u2019t clean up your act, investors will not wait around,\u201d Baker Botts\u2019 said. \u201cThey have other options.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Asian Development Bank (ADB) has sanctioned a Rs 754 crore loan to waste-to-energy maker SAEL Industries, according to a top executive at the renewable energy company. The funds will be used for the construction of five biomass power plants in the districts of Bikaner, Churu, Hanumangarh, Jhunjhunu and Sikar in Rajasthan.As part of a five-year plan, SAEL intends to construct 3.5 gigawatts of green energy capacity. It will add 100 megawatts of new biomass and 600 megawatts of new solar capacity annually over the next four years. It already has over 600 megawatts of existing power generation capacity, which includes solar and biomass energy plants.SAEL's chairman and managing director Jasbir Singh declined to comment on the loan from ADB when contacted. He elaborated on his company's business model.  By collecting the crop stubble to be used as fuel in our waste-to-energy plants, we contribute to combat one of our nation's greatest health issues, while at the same time creating local employment and generating extra income for farmers and local entrepreneurs,  said Singh.Singh believes the biomass plants are a solution for the National Capital Region\u2019s pollution problems, which are partly a fallout of north Indian farmers burning rice stubble after harvesting the crop every year because burning is a cheaper alternative to transporting and disposing the stubble waste.SAEL sets up its energy plants in rural areas near cultivable lands. It purchases the rice stubble, which would usually have been burnt by farmers, and uses it as raw material to generate electricity.The Delhi-based company has the largest capacity of waste-to-energy generation projects in India and generates over 175 megawatts of electricity from its biomass power plants located in agrarian regions of north India.Norway's state-owned Norfund invested Rs500 crore for an undisclosed stake in SAEL in January, citing it was bullish on financing the company's efforts to reduce emissions and local pollution.",

        "articleBody": "Germany has declared last-minute opposition to a landmark European Union law to end sales of CO2-emitting cars in 2035, demanding that sales be allowed of new cars with internal combustion engines after that date if they run on e-fuels. The EU rules would require all new cars sold from 2035 to have zero CO2 emissions, making it effectively impossible to sell new fossil fuel-powered cars. The law - which Germany, alongside a majority of EU countries and lawmakers, previously supported - would not ban internal combustion engines (ICEs). But it is seen as a death knell for the technology because of a dearth of options that could enable ICE cars to operate without producing CO2. Here's what you need to know. WHAT ARE E-FUELS?E-fuels, like e-kerosene, e-methane, or e-methanol, are made by synthesizing captured CO2 emissions and hydrogen produced using renewable or CO2-free electricity. The fuels release CO2 into the atmosphere when used in an engine. But the idea is that those emissions are equal to the amount taken out of the atmosphere to produce the fuel - making it CO2-neutral overall. Germany and Italy want clearer assurances from the EU that sales of new ICE cars can continue beyond 2035, if they run on CO2-neutral fuels. WHO MAKES THEM?Most major carmakers are betting on battery-electric vehicles - a technology that is already widely available - as the main route to cut CO2 emissions from passenger cars. But suppliers and oil majors defend e-fuels, as well as a number of carmakers who don't want their vehicles weighed down by heavy batteries. E-fuels are not yet produced at scale. The world's first commercial plant opened in Chile in 2021, backed by Porsche and aiming to produce 550 million litres per year. Other planned plants include Norway's Norsk e-Fuel, due to begin producing in 2024 with a focus on aviation fuel. CAN E-FUELS CLEAN UP CARS?E-fuels can be used in today's ICE vehicles and transported via existing fossil fuel logistics networks - good news for ICE component makers and companies which transport petrol and diesel. Supporters say e-fuels offer a route to cut the CO2 emissions of our existing passenger car fleet, without replacing every vehicle with an electric one. Critics highlight that manufacturing e-fuels is very expensive and energy-intensive. Using e-fuels in an ICE car requires about five times more renewable electricity than running a battery-electric vehicle, according to a 2021 paper in the Nature Climate Change journal. Some policymakers also argue that e-fuels should be reserved for hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as shipping and aviation - which, unlike passenger cars, cannot easily run on electric batteries. WHAT NEXT FOR THE EU LAW?Days before the final vote on the EU law, which was scheduled for March 7, German Transport Minister Volker Wissing called into question Germany's support for it. That has put one of Europe's core climate change policies on hold - and surprised other policymakers, because EU countries and lawmakers had already agreed the law last year. Alongside Germany and Italy, countries including the Czech Republic and Poland have expressed concerns about the law, raising the possibility of enough support to block it. But other EU lawmakers and diplomats warn that allowing one country to torpedo an already-agreed law would endanger other carefully negotiated deals on EU policies. Free Democratic Party member Wissing said the use of e-fuels should remain possible after 2035, and a promised European Commission proposal on this was still missing. In response, the European Commission has drafted a proposal, seen by Reuters, to allow carmakers to register new cars in the EU that can run on climate neutral e-fuels only. That could be a first step towards allowing their sale after 2035. The draft proposal said vehicles must use technology that would prevent the car from starting if it used non-carbon-neutral fuels. The International Council on Clean Transportation said it was doubtful technologies would be able to sense whether a vehicle is operating on pure e-fuels or a blend with fossil fuels - since e-fuels have very similar properties to the fossil fuels they are designed to replace. An EU official told Reuters any new proposal would be made only after countries approve the combustion engine phaseout. Germany's Transport Ministry said it was examining the draft proposal. WHAT DO COMPANIES WANT?Big auto component suppliers in Germany such as Bosch, ZF and Mahle are members of the eFuel Alliance, an industry lobby group, as are oil and gas majors from ExxonMobil to Repsol. Carmakers such as Piech, Porsche and Mazda are broadly supportive of the technology. Porsche holds a stake in e-fuel producer HIF Global. BMW has invested $12.5 million in e-fuel startup Prometheus Fuels, while also investing billions in battery-electric technology. Other carmakers including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz are betting on battery-electric vehicles to decarbonise. Volvo and Ford this week urged EU countries not to row back on the 2035 phaseout of new petrol and diesel cars.",

        "articleBody": "Global renewable energy capacity grew by a record 9.6% last year but needs to grow by three times the current rate to limit global warming, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said on Tuesday. IRENA's annual report on renewable energy statistics said global renewable energy capacity amounted to 3,372 gigawatts (GW) at the end of last year, some 295 GW or 9.6% higher than the previous year. Some 83% of all new power capacity last year was from renewables.  This continued record growth shows the resilience of renewable energy amidst the lingering energy crisis,  IRENA's Director General Francesco La Camera said.  But annual additions of renewable power capacity must grow three times the current level by 2030 if we want to stay on a pathway limiting global warming to 1.5C,  he added. Solar and wind energy dominated the renewable capacity expansion, jointly accounting for 90% of all net renewable additions in 2022, the report said. Almost half of the new capacity was added in Asia. China was the largest contributor, adding 141 GW to Asia's new capacity. Renewables in Europe and North America grew by 57.3 GW and 29.1 GW respectively, while the Middle East recorded its highest increase in renewables on record, with 3.2 GW of new capacity commissioned in 2022, an increase of 12.8% from the previous year. On Monday, a report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said emissions must be halved by the mid-2030s if the world is to have any chance of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels - a key target enshrined in the global climate pact the Paris Agreement.",

As per the Reassessment Study carried out by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) during 1978-1987, the assessed hydropower potential in the country is about 1,45,320 MW (for projects with capacity above 25 MW), Power Minister R K Singh said in a written reply to Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.  Singh said that 42,104.6 MW (29 per cent) out of 1,45,320 MW has been developed and 15,023.5 MW (10.3 per cent) is under construction.  As per reports of the International Hydropower Association (IHA), the US has developed more than 80 per cent of its hydropower potential and the EU (European Union) has developed more than 70 per cent of its hydropower potential, he told the House.  The main challenges in the development of hydroelectric potential in the country are remote location, unpredictable geology, natural calamities, environment and forest issues, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) issues, law & order issues and inter-state issues, he stated.  In a separate reply, Singh told the House that as on March 14, 2023, the total coal stock at Thermal Power Plants in the country is 33.3 MT (million tonnes) which is only 49 per cent of the Normative Stock Requirement.  The coal stocking norms of the Central Electricity Authority mandate the power plants to maintain coal stock which varies from month to month basis.  The stocking norms are 20 to 26 days in non-pithead plants and 12 to 17 days in pithead plants so as to ensure sufficient coal stock at power plants to meet demand, it stated.",

        "articleBody": "The 300 MW hybrid project in partnership with ReNew is expected to commence operation in the next 18 months, Jindal Stainless Managing Director Abhyuday Jindal has said. In December 2022, Jindal Stainless Ltd (JSL) partnered with ReNew to develop the proposed 300 MW hybrid energy project. When asked about the timeline of the project, Jindal told PTI,  We (JSL and ReNew) are on track on the pact. That project is 300 MW. Land acquisition has already been completed for the project . The project will start in the next one and a half years' time, he said. On the company's hydrogen project, the MD said it is expected to start in July this year. In August 2022, the country's largest stainless steel player partnered with Hygenco India Private Limited to set up a green hydrogen plant.  These green initiatives are part of our mission to switch from a thermal energy-intensive manufacturing setup to renewable energy alternatives,  he said. The company will continue to take proactive steps to reduce carbon emissions of its present and planned capacities, Jindal said. JSL is also in process of investing Rs 120 crore to set up a 21 MW rooftop solar capacity at its Jajpur unit and another 6 MW in the Hisar facility, he added. The energy generated from the solar, wind and hydrogen units will be used in various processes of stainless steel-making plants, he said. In FY22, JSL reduced its carbon emissions by 1.4 lakh tonnes and aims to become carbon neutral by 2050, Jindal said.",

        "articleBody": "Germany has declared last-minute opposition to a landmark European Union law to end sales of CO2-emitting cars in 2035, demanding that sales be allowed of new cars with internal combustion engines after that date if they run on e-fuels. The EU law would require all new cars sold from 2035 to have zero CO2 emissions, making it effectively impossible to sell new fossil fuel-powered cars. The rules - which Germany, alongside a majority of EU countries and lawmakers, previously supported - would not ban internal combustion engines (ICEs). But the law is seen as a death knell for the technology because of a dearth of options that could enable ICE cars to operate without producing CO2. Here's what you need to know. WHAT ARE E-FUELS?E-fuels, like e-kerosene, e-methane, or e-methanol, are made by synthesizing captured CO2 emissions and hydrogen produced using renewable or CO2-free electricity. The fuels release CO2 into the atmosphere when combusted in an engine. But the idea is that those emissions are equal to the amount taken out of the atmosphere to produce the fuel - making it CO2-neutral overall. Germany and Italy want clearer assurances from the EU that sales of new ICE cars can continue beyond 2035, if they run on CO2-neutral fuels. WHO MAKES THEM?Most major carmakers are betting on battery-electric vehicles - a technology that is already widely available - as the main route to cut CO2 emissions from passenger cars. But suppliers and oil majors defend e-fuels, as well as a number of carmakers who don't want their vehicles weighed down by heavy batteries. E-fuels are not yet produced at scale. The world's first commercial plant opened in Chile in 2021, backed by Porsche and aiming to produce 550 million litres per year. Other planned plants include Norsk e-Fuel in Norway, due to begin producing in 2024 with a focus on aviation fuel. CAN E-FUELS CLEAN UP CARS?E-fuels can be used in today's ICE vehicles and transported via existing fossil fuel logistics networks - good news for suppliers of ICE car component makers and companies which transport petrol and diesel. Supporters say e-fuels offer a route to cut the CO2 emissions of our existing passenger car fleet, without replacing every vehicle with an electric one. Critics highlight that manufacturing e-fuels is very expensive and energy-intensive. Using e-fuels in an ICE car requires about five times more renewable electricity than running a battery-electric vehicle, according to a 2021 paper in the Nature Climate Change journal. Even advocates say Europe will not have enough spare renewable power to produce e-fuels at scale and will have to import it from other regions. Some policymakers also argue that e-fuels should be reserved for hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as shipping and aviation - which, unlike passenger cars, cannot easily run on electric batteries. WHAT NEXT FOR THE EU LAW?Days before the final vote on the EU law, which was scheduled for March 7, German Transport Minister Volker Wissing called into question Germany's support for it, surprising policymakers including the environment ministry led by the Greens. Free Democratic Party member Wissing said the use of e-fuels should remain possible after 2035, and a promised European Commission proposal on this was still missing. The EU law says the Commission will make a proposal on how vehicles running on CO2-neutral fuels can be sold after 2035, if this complies with climate goals. But Germany's transport ministry wants clearer assurances. Berlin's last-minute move angered some EU lawmakers and diplomats, who warn that allowing one country to torpedo an already-agreed law would endanger other carefully negotiated deals on EU policies. For now, the future of one of Europe's core climate change policies is uncertain. If Germany's coalition government cannot agree a position on the law, it will have to abstain in the EU vote. Italy has already voiced opposition, alongside countries including Poland - raising the possibility of enough support to block the law. EU officials are racing to find a solution. The European Commission said on March 6 it is in talks  at all levels  to conclude the law as soon as possible. WHAT DO COMPANIES WANT?Big auto component suppliers in Germany such as Bosch, ZF and Mahle are members of the eFuel Alliance, an industry lobby group, as are oil and gas majors from ExxonMobil to Repsol. Carmakers such as Piech, Porsche and Mazda are broadly supportive of the technology. Porsche holds a stake in e-fuel producer HIF Global and is the sole buyer of fuel from its pilot project in Chile. BMW has invested $12.5 million in e-fuel startup Prometheus Fuels, while also investing billions in battery-electric technology. Other carmakers including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, meanwhile, have made clear that they are betting on battery-electric vehicles to decarbonise.",

        "articleBody": "BP hasn't fallen out of love with renewables. It just wants to have more power. CEO Bernard Looney's pursuit of green energy outstripped all rivals three years ago when he outlined a radical blueprint to move away from fossil fuels. Last month he applied the brakes, slowing BP's planned cuts in oil and gas and scaling back planned renewables spending in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The oil major isn't backing away from renewables though, its green chief Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath stresses, it's simply changing the terms of the relationship. Dotzenrath told Reuters BP was reviewing its solar and onshore wind businesses as part of a revamp that will see it move away from selling the clean electricity it produces, and instead keep hold of most of it to supply its growing electric vehicle charging network and production of low-carbon fuels. The onshore renewables scrutiny, which hasn't been previously reported, follows reviews by Dotzenrath of BP's offshore wind and hydrogen businesses over the past year which led to overhauls that saw the company install new managers, hire staff, scrap some projects and seek to revise terms of others.  We made some changes internally and created a focused hydrogen organisation, a focused offshore wind organisation,  Dotzenrath said in an interview.  I'm (now) just reviewing the onshore renewables part - so the onshore wind and solar part.  BP's head of renewables and gas didn't elaborate on the nature of the latest review. The green stakes are high, though, given solar alone comprises more than half of BP's 43-gigawatt renewables project pipeline. Dotzenrath also put the first numbers to BP's rebalancing act, which comes amid deteriorating profits in renewables power generation, telling Reuters that the company aimed to retain 80% of the power produced to supply the global EV network and to make  green  fuels such as hydrogen, seen by many transition experts as a key fuel of the future. She did not give a timeframe for the shift, which represents a major pivot given the vast majority of BP's renewables output is currently linked to power grids. BP will continue to build some projects under traditional power supply deals, she added.  We will not grow renewables for the sake of growing wind and solar,  said Dotzenrath, who is marking a year in the job after joining BP shortly after Russia's invasion undermined Europe's energy security, fuelled bumper profits for oil and gas and changed the calculus of the energy transition.  Our strategy is not necessarily about asset ownership in renewables, but it comes as a consequence. It is really about securing access to cheap - the cheapest - green electron,  she added, referring to electricity from renewable sources. IN FOCUS: VENTURE WITH EQUINORThe most eye-popping change in the strategy update last month was BP slowing its planned cuts in oil and gas output from 40% to 25% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It also lowered its projected annual spending on renewables to up to $5 billion by 2030 out of a total group budget of up to $18 billion, from $6 billion out of $16 billion under its previous update in 2022, according to a Reuters analysis. While BP's move to produce more oil and gas for longer puts it more in line with its peers, its 25% annual reduction goal is still more ambitious than any of its global rivals. The paring of green ambitions has been cheered by the market, with BP shares leaping about 17% since the Feb. 7 strategy update, much more than any other rival Western major. By contrast, BP had significantly underperformed rivals since Looney outlined his industry-leading transition plans three years ago, remaining largely flat until the announcement compared with a 20% gain for Shell and 84% rise for Exxon. The renewables revamp reflects an acknowledgement that the company won't be able to sufficiently compete with traditional power generators if it simply sells the energy produced by its wind and solar projects, according to Dotzenrath.  It's a critical feedstock,  she said.  If it is not integrated with our other businesses, we will not do this because we don't believe that we have a competitive edge.  The company's new trajectory has placed its flagship U.S. offshore wind joint venture with Norway's Equinor in the focus of managers, five sources familiar with the matter separately told Reuters. BP executives, including Dotzenrath, have held several meetings with Equinor in London in recent weeks to discuss ways to give the oil major greater clout in the venture, said the two BP and three Equinor sources, who are close to the talks and declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. BP wants more of its staff involved in the Oslo-based venture, the people said. One of the Equinor sources with direct knowledge of the operations said BP currently had more than 20 people working on the JV projects out of a total of over 270. Equinor declined to comment on any  speculation  about changes to the venture sought by BP. It said it looked forward to applying their combined expertise to develop projects on the U.S. East Coast. Dotzenrath also declined to comment on this.  I am very happy with the joint venture and the progress we are making with the projects,  Dotzenrath said.  These are very, very complex, large, mega projects ... we have much more ability to support Equinor in the delivery of these projects.  THAT'S THE BRUTAL REALITYWhen BP paid $1.1 billion for its 50% stake in the venture to enter offshore wind in 2020, it was more reliant on the know-how of Equinor, which had over a decade of experience and specialism in the sector. Over the past two years, though, BP has brought in hundreds of staff from renewables firms. It has also broken from its tradition of developing leaders internally and hired senior executives such as Dotzenrath, a former CEO of Germany's RWE Renewables, and an offshore wind chief from Danish giant Orsted. The UK major surprised many investors and analysts in December when it decided not to join Equinor in bidding on a floating wind project off California. Floating offshore wind is a nascent technology that remains significantly more expensive than turbines fixed to the seabed.  This was a portfolio decision,  Dotzenrath said.  The North Sea is much more important to us and our integration story than California. I think that's the brutal reality at the moment.  THE NEW NORMAL IN NUMBERSBP's renewables revamp is underpinned by its projections about how much money it can make from the production and sale of green power versus higher-margin low-carbon businesses within its own integrated operations. The company's outlook for its average core earnings from oil and gas in 2030 grew by around $10 billion to $42.5 billion over the course of last year, and by a meagre $1.5 billion to $11 billion from energy-transition businesses including renewables. BP expects a return on investment of at least 15% on bioenergy including biogas as well as from combining EV charging with retail stores. Hydrogen is seen bringing in 10% returns, with renewables lagging at a maximum of 8% under the current model dominated by power sales. While BP had a stated target in 2020 of trading 500 terawatt hours of electricity by 2030 - twice the volume in 2019 - no such target featured in its 2023 strategy update. Dotzenrath said growth in renewables capacity would be in service to green hydrogen and other businesses it supplied internally with clean power.  We take the green electron and do something with it,  she added.  Access and control over the green electron is key because the world is short of green electrons. ",

While discussions on viability gap funding (VGF) are on, Bhalla said other processes are also being identified.\u201cWe have floated a concept note on the proposed VGF for the initial installations. Once that gets through, we will take formal approvals and begin implementing. The process for non-VGF projects is also being finalised,\u201d he said.Offshore wind projects hold importance in India\u2019s quest to meet 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.Bhalla said no formal decision on the relaxation in the approved list of models and manufacturers has been taken by the government yet but the matter is currently being evaluated.This comes in the backdrop of a large solar capacity addition pipeline, which the local manufacturers may not be able to cater to until enough production capacities come online.The list so far includes domestic solar module manufacturers that have been given certificates by the Bureau of Indian Standards.The ministry will calibrate targets of renewable energy as domestic solar equipment manufacturing increases.\u201cBut we will see a gradual rise in capacity addition in renewable energy. There is no other option if we want to reach the 500 GW target,\u201d said Bhalla.As for the upcoming summer demand, which is expected to be higher than that last year, the ministry is helping expedite the renewable energy projects that are near commissioning.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India is looking to tweak the funding modalities for hydropower projects in the country, aiming to harness the unutilised potential in the north-eastern and Himalayan states as part of its clean energy shift.A senior government official told ET that NITI Aayog member VK Saraswat-led advisory group is firming up an action plan for river basin development and hydropower projects in these states. The focus would be on keeping the long-term generation tariffs of hydropower projects at par with average national power purchase tariff,  the official said.According to the official, one of the reasons for the high tariff of hydropower is loading of the cost of flood moderation and enabling infrastructure in project cost. 98372063 In this backdrop, an action plan is being firmed up to enhance the budgetary support for enabling infrastructure and tweaking the tariff rationalisation measures to bring down the tariff, thereby reducing the burden on the consumer,  he said.The government can also look at providing longer-term soft loans for such projects to even out tariffs over time while making it mandatory for power retailers to include a share of hydropower in their purchases, the official added.While the national power purchase cost is \u20b93.75 per kWh, for hydropower it goes up to \u20b98.55 per kWh, making it unviable for consumers.As per the Central Electricity Authority, India has an installed hydropower capacity of 46,850 MW, which is 11.4% of the total installed capacity. However, it is estimated that India has the hydropower potential of 145,320 MW.Besides being environment friendly, hydropower has the ability for quick ramping, black start, reactive absorption etc, which makes it ideal for peaking power, spinning reserve and grid balancing and stability.Further, hydropower also provides water security, irrigation and flood moderation benefits, apart from socioeconomic development of the entire region by providing employment opportunities and boosting tourism etc.",

The launch of new schemes in the support of biomass cogeneration projects is playing a crucial role in the capacity additions of small biogas plants located in remote and rural parts of India, the report by 1Lattice, a technology-enabled decision support organisation, said. The Indian biomass market is attracting investments from global green energy companies. There is a growing demand for the supply of clean and reliable power to businesses in India and biomass as a source of energy is expected to play a crucial role in meeting the power demand, the report explained.  Abhishek Maiti, Director, 1Lattice in a statement said,  India currently has an installed capacity of 10.2 GW for biomass production and the biomass market in India is expected to reach Rs 32,000 crore by FY'31.   Investments and collaborations in the biomass energy ecosystem will present an opportunity for organisations to make climate-smart decisions and move the world closer to goal of net-zero carbon emissions, he also stated.  Through these investments, players in the biomass energy ecosystem will be able to provide more environment-friendly choices to consumers which will help in achieving the goal of sustainable society, he added.  The current availability of biomass in India is estimated at about 750 MMT per annum and surplus biomass availability at about 230 MMT per annum. The installed capacity for biomass production in India has grown at a CAGR of 4 per cent reaching 10 GW in FY22.  Government initiatives such as biomass power & cogeneration programme along with the revised policy for biomass utilisation have promoted technologies for the optimum use of the country's biomass resources.  Other factors such as attractive investments from foreign green companies and technological advancements are also contributing to driving the biomass market in India, it stated.",

        "articleBody": "Danish minister for energy, climate and utilities Lars Aagaard on Tuesday said Denmark can learn from India's ability to bring down renewables tariff especially solar and both nations can embark on the green hydrogen future together. India has considerably brought down tariff of renewable energy especially solar through e-reverse auction of projects. India's solar and wind power tariffs had touched all-time low levels of Rs 1.99 per unit and Rs 2.43 per unit under these auctions.   We can learn from your development on solar energy. We can learn from your ability to bring down cost and we can embark on the (green) hydrogen future together,  Aagaard said, addressing the special plenary session on energy at 'Indian and Denmark: Partners for Green and Sustainable Progress Conference' organised by CII.  He said that he had visited India as a young man 35 years ago and since then India's population has grown by more than 400 million.  He lauded India's management's efforts to provide electricity to more than 700 million people during the last 35 years.   It is amazing and looking ahead India will need much more electricity to fuel the economy... Actually you (India) are going to install electricity capacity which equals the existing capacity of Europe today,  he said.  On India's 500GW of non-fossil energy target by 2030, he said  this (500GW target) shows that India has a size. But I also think that you also have the skills that the world needs.   Denmark is committed to working with India at all levels to make the future resilient and green,  he added.  Minister of Foreign Affairs Lars Lokke Rasmussen said,  We recognise India's role in achieving global roles in green and sustainable goals and we support it fully.   The Danish companies hold an expertise in accelerating green transitions and have a long experience in lowering energy consumption and emissions, he added.  Now Denmark looks forward to working together and signing of commercial MOUs and agreements between the two governments, he added.  As many as seven memorandum of understanding (MoU) were inked during this conference between Danish and Indian firms.  As part of these MoUs, ISS and Tata Power have collaborated to convert all of ISS India's India-based clients' portfolios to green energy and to evaluate opportunities to extend Tata Power's renewable energy offerings to these portfolios.  Moreover, India's SAEL Industries selected Danish biomass boiler company Burmeister & Wain Energy as technology provider for the supply of six Biomass Waste to energy boilers.  Stiesdal and L&T have inked an MoU for increasing the collaboration within floating offshore wind technology in India and globally, as well as exploring the possibility for the use of Danish solutions and technologies in a broader perspective throughout the business.  Hempel and L&T have inked an MoU to establish cooperation to jointly enter new business segments, as well as jointly participate in projects, such as providing solid sustainability and green energy solutions for the market.  Meanwhile, two academic institutions Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) have entered into a strategic partnership within water and energy that will build a bridge between researchers and students in both countries as well as pave the way for collaboration with industry and authorities.  Under the  Green Strategic Partnership , Topsoe A/S and HPCL Mittal Energy Ltd (HMEL) are exploring to collaborate and extend their long standing relationship in CleanTech.  With this cooperation both companies hope to propel India's growth in Green Hydrogen and its derivatives outlined in its National Green Hydrogen Mission as well as to contribute to India's Net Zero goal by 2070.",

        "articleBody": "With an abundance of sun and wind, Spain is positioning itself as Europe's future leader in green hydrogen production to clean up heavy industries. But some energy sector experts express caution over ramping up an industry that would be wholly reliant on massive increases in the availability of zero-carbon electricity. Ecological transition minister Teresa Ribera hosted a major conference earlier this month for global renewable energy players. It focused on measures  to guarantee our energy security  as the European Union refocuses on intra-bloc supply chains for its energy needs. The Spanish government announced a Hydrogen Roadmap in 2020, but the sector has taken on greater importance in Europe since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas, which powers most global hydrogen production. The International Energy Agency said in December that Spain would account for half of Europe's growth in dedicated renewable capacity for hydrogen production. Green hydrogen is created when renewable energy sources power an electrical current that runs through water, separating its hydrogen and oxygen molecules through electrolysis. The process doesn't produce planet-warming carbon dioxide, but less than 0.1% of global hydrogen production is currently created in this way, according to the IEA. The separated hydrogen can be used in the production of steel, ammonia and chemical products, all of which require industrial processes that are harder to wean off fossil fuels. Hydrogen can also be used as a transportation fuel, which could one day transform the highly polluting shipping and aviation sectors.  Renewable energy, including renewable hydrogen, is a central pillar of the REPowerEU Plan, which is the EU's strategy to get rid of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible,  said EU Commissioner for Energy, Kadri Simson, in an email. Spain already has 15.5 gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity earmarked for green hydrogen, far higher than the target of four gigawatts set out in the roadmap for 2030. Spain's large, windswept and sparsely populated territory receives more than 2,500 hours of sunshine on average per year, according to the state weather agency, providing ideal conditions for wind and solar energy, and therefore green hydrogen production.   If you look at where hydrogen is going to be produced in Europe in the next million years, it's in two countries, Spain and Portugal,  said Thierry Lepercq, the founder and president of HyDeal Ambition, an industry platform bringing together 30 companies.  Hydrogen is the new oil.  Lepercq is working with companies like Spanish gas pipeline corporation Enagas and global steel giant ArcelorMittal to design an end-to-end model for hydrogen production, distribution and supply at a competitive price. Criticism has centered on green hydrogen's higher cost compared with highly-polluting  gray hydrogen  drawn from natural gas. Lepercq argues that solar energy produced in Spain is priced low enough to compete. While cars and heating solutions for buildings are increasingly electric, other sectors are harder to crack. Globally, Lepercq said,  Electricity, power, is 20% of energy consumption. What about the 80% that is not electrified? ... You need to replace those fossil fuels. Not in 50 years time. You need to replace them now.   HyDeal aims to replace high-emitting processes like using coking coal and blast furnaces in steel manufacturing, and natural gas in ammonia production for fertilizers. It must first build solar farms and electrolyzers in northern Spain, joining other green hydrogen plants recently inaugurated in central Spain and Mallorca. The European Commission has proposed that the bloc produce 10 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and to import 10 million metric tons more. Hydrogen consumption in Spain is currently around 500,000 metric tons per year, mainly produced from natural gas and used in refineries and chemical production. By 2030, the EU is attempting to cut emissions in the bloc by 55% compared to 1990 levels.  Spain, France, Germany and Portugal have agreed to build a hydrogen pipeline by 2030 to transport some 2 million metric tons of hydrogen to France annually - 10% of the EU's estimated hydrogen needs. Hydrogen presents challenges for transportation as it is highly flammable and can corrode metals. Ribera, the Spanish minister, knows green hydrogen requires an upfront investment that will only pay off in the long term. Slashing emissions  needs an initial stage that can be covered with renewable energies,  she said in an interview with The Associated Press, adding that for sectors like heating and transport,  it's fundamental to electrify.  Spain, she continued, would also need to cut fossil fuels for  end uses for which electricity is not so simple.  A huge amount of extra renewable power generation will be required to build a green hydrogen future. The IEA says the world will need 50 gigawatts of renewable capacity dedicated to green hydrogen production by 2027 - a 100-fold increase. Some industry experts argue the push for green hydrogen is the wrong focus at a delicate tipping point for renewables following the fallout of the Ukraine war for the energy sector.  In Europe in particular, there's been a huge push for hydrogen, which in my point of view is unjustifiable,  said Antonella Battaglini, CEO of the Renewables Grid Initiative. The EU target of 20 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2030 requires electricity  that we don't have the renewable resources to produce,  she added. Current demand for hydrogen far outstrips the EU's planned supply, Battaglini argues, posing  the risk that we are driven away from direct electrification into a hydrogen bubble.   Experts like Battaglini fear that companies could argue that when sufficient renewable power isn't available, they will need to keep relying on fossil fuels.   There could be a very high cost. In economic terms, but also in environmental terms. You may end up with higher emissions than you have today,  she said.",

        "articleBody": "Essar Group today announced the formation of Essar Energy Transition (EET) to drive the creation of the UK\u2019s leading energy transition hub in North West England.EET, the group said plans to invest a total of $3.6 billion in developing a range of low carbon energy transition projects over the next five years, of which $2.4 billion will be invested across its site at Stanlow, between Liverpool and Manchester and $1.2 billion in India.\u201cEET\u2019s ambitious investment plans will not only help deliver the UK\u2019s net zero ambitions and the enormous environmental benefits therein, but will also secure the long term sustainable future for Stanlow, protecting and creating new highly skilled job opportunities at the heart of the Northern Powerhouse economy for generations to come,  said Tony Fountain, Managing Partner of Essar Energy Transition.The investments, across a range of hydrogen production technologies, decarbonisation, biofuels (road and aviation), and infrastructure projects, will contribute to North West England quickly becoming one of the leading post-carbon industrial clusters in Europe, the group said in a press statement.These investments, the group added, will support the reduction of around 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, around 20% of the total industrial emissions in North West England.EET will include---Essar Oil UK, the company\u2019s refining and marketing business in North West England; Vertex Hydrogen, which is developing 1 gigawatt (GW) of blue hydrogen for the UK market, with follow-on capacity set to reach 3.8GW;EET Future Energy, which is developing 1 GW of green ammonia in India, targeted at UK and international markets; Stanlow Terminals Ltd, which is developing enabling storage and pipeline infrastructure; and EET Biofuels, which is investing in developing 1 MT of low carbon biofuels.EET\u2019s investment programme will play a major role in accelerating the UK\u2019s low carbon transformation, supporting the government\u2019s decarbonisation policy and creating highly skilled employment opportunities at the heart of the Northern Powerhouse economy.Essar Group is also investing in creation of an LNG value chain in India, including LNG truck manufacturing and LNG fuel stations, setting up a pellet plant in Odisha, in eastern India and a 4-million tonnes per annum green steel complex at Ras-Al-Khair, Saudi Arabia. EET\u2019s strategy is founded on the fact that hydrogen and biofuels are fast becoming globally significant fuels of the future and that the UK is positioned strongly to spearhead the rapid growth of the European low carbon fuels market,  Essar Group added in the press statement.The UK already benefits from an advanced regulatory and policy framework to support low carbon energy production, including the UK government\u2019s target of achieving 10GW of hydrogen production by 2030, alongside developing low carbon hydrogen infrastructure, expertise and significant customer demand.Such is the scale of the market growth opportunity that EET estimates approximately two- thirds of its aggregate cash flows could come from diversified low carbon sources before the end of the decade.As a core part of the HyNet cluster, Essar\u2019s Stanlow site already plays a prominent role in the UK\u2019s energy transition planning framework, following the selection of HyNet by the UK government in 2021 as one of only two hydrogen clusters in the country to potentially be supported through to full operations.The Stanlow refinery itself will also achieve a 75% reduction in carbon emissions before the end of this decade as part of EET\u2019s decarbonisation plans, making this strategically critical fuel supplier to the UK one of the most sustainable refineries in Europe.In addition to the US$2.4 billion investment in the UK, EET will also invest US$1.2 billion in developing a cost-efficient global supply hub for low carbon fuels in India, including green hydrogen and green ammonia. Ammonia will be shipped from India to the UK, Europe and globally to meet expanding market demand for green hydrogen.EET\u2019s investment in India will help deliver on the country\u2019s emerging hydrogen ambition. The Indian government\u2019s supportive regulatory framework is designed to help position the country as a leading global hub of green hydrogen production and exports, as set out in its National Green Hydrogen Mission, approved by the Indian government on 4 January 2023.Prashant Ruia, Director, Essar Capital, said, \u201cWe are excited about the opportunity to drive the UK\u2019s energy transition by producing low carbon future fuels which will help eliminate around 20% of the industrial carbon dioxide in Northwest England. In doing so, it will provide a blueprint for how traditional industries globally can be successfully transformed into hubs for the production of future energies.",

        "articleBody": "Airbus SE and Qantas Airways Ltd plan to announce the first investment from a $200 million fund to develop a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Australia within about a month, an Airbus executive said on Monday. The companies established the fund last year after Qantas set a target of using 10% SAF in its fuel mix by 2030 and placed a multibillion-dollar order for Airbus narrowbody and widebody planes. Australia lacks an SAF industry, meaning Qantas' purchases of the fuel are made at overseas airports. Stephen Forshaw, Airbus' chief representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, said the manufacturer and Qantas were meeting weekly to discuss $1 million-plus investments in early stage SAF projects in Australia.  The first investment has been made but not fully closed yet,  he said in an interview ahead of the Australia International Airshow, which begins on Tuesday.  We've both agreed to it, and I think we'll make some announcements probably in the next month or so around the completion of that.  Qantas declined to comment. Forshaw said most of the investments being considered involved seed funding, where the partners might take a minority equity stake.  Some of them may be even earlier than Series A. What it may do is provide us with the opportunity or right of first refusal to go in at Series A or Series B or beyond,  he said.  And then the pace will determine whether we want to do that or whether we see it is time to open it up to other investors.  He declined to say what type of project was planned for the first investment but said that in the longer term, Australia had lots of potential to use solar power for projects that would help meet demand given limited feedstock available from sources like oils and fats. Qantas Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Parker last week told analysts the airline could meet its 2030 target of 10% SAF solely through purchases in London and California if needed, but noted that 70% of the airline's total fuel was sourced from Australia.  We know we have to play a lead role in developing a domestic industry,  he said, adding there could be local production by the second half of the decade. Qantas expects about 60% of its fuel could be SAF by 2050 to meet its target of net zero emissions by that date. ($1 = 1.4865 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Jamie Freed. Editing by Gerry Doyle)",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's top oil firm IOC will set up green hydrogen plants at all its refineries as it pivots a Rs 2-lakh crore green transition plan to achieve net-zero emissions from its operations by 2046, its chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is remodelling business with an increased focus on petrochemicals to hedge volatility in the fuel business, while at the same time turning petrol pumps into energy outlets that offer EV charging points and battery swapping options besides conventional fuels as it looks to make itself future-ready, he said.  The company intends to expand its refining capacity to 106.7 million tonnes per annum from 81.2 million tonnes as it sees India's oil demand climbing from 5.1 million barrels per day to 7-7.2 million bpd by 2030 and 9 million bpd by 2040.   Oil will continue to be a mainstay fuel for the next few years but we are preparing for transition which will involve a combination of green hydrogen, biofuels, EVs and alternate fuels,  he said.  Hydrogen -- the cleanest known fuel that discharges only oxygen and water when burnt -- is being touted as the fuel of the future, but its relatively higher cost then alternate fuel currently limit its usage in industries. Refineries, which turn crude oil into fuel such as petrol and diesel, use hydrogen to lower the sulfur content of diesel fuel.  This hydrogen is currently produced using fossil fuels such as natural gas. IOC plans to use electricity generated from renewable sources such as solar to split water to produce green hydrogen.  In an interview with PTI, Vaidya said the company will set up a 7,000 tonnes per annum green hydrogen producing facility at its Panipat oil refinery at a cost of Rs 2,000 crore by 2025.   We are starting with Panipat but eventually all refineries will have green hydrogen units,  he said.  This is part of the company's target of achieving net-zero emissions from operations by 2046.   We plan to invest over Rs 2 lakh crore to achieve net-zero,  he said.  These investments cover setting up green hydrogen facilities at refineries, improving efficiency, renewable energy capacity addition and alternate fuels.  Currently, IOC's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, emanating majorly from the company's refining operations, is 21.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e) per annum. This will rise to 40.44 MMTCO2e by 2030 after considering the expansions planned and taking the emissions of its subsidiaries into account.  The company plans to use natural gas in refineries in place of liquid fuels as well as replace grey hydrogen (produced from fossil fuel) with green one that is manufactured from renewable power.  IOC is also looking at carbon offsetting through ecosystem restoration and Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), among others.   We plan to achieve two-thirds of emission reduction through energy efficiency, electrification and fuel replacement efforts, while about a third of the total emission would be mitigated through options such as CCUS, nature-based solutions and purchase of carbon credits,  he said.  Out of its current emissions, 96 per cent are on account of processes like direct fuel burning for deriving energy from heat, steam, electricity and cooling, which are part of operations. These constitute the Scope-1 emissions. The balance 4 per cent is on account of sourcing electricity from the grid which constitutes Scope-2 emissions.  Vaidya said IOC had prepared a roadmap to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions - that is, emissions produced from its crude refining operations and energy consumption.  It plans for green hydrogen to account for 50 per cent of its overall hydrogen output in 5-10 years and 100 per cent by 2040.  Vaidya also said IOC plans to raise renewable energy capacity to 12 gigawatts from current 256 MW, and would have electric vehicle charging facilities at 10,000 fuel stations in two years.  The petrochemical intensity - the percentage of crude oil converted into chemicals- is low at 5-6 per cent currently.  We intend to take it up to 10-12 per cent,  he said.  The firm's newer refineries at Panipat in Haryana and Paradip in Odisha have the petrochemical intensity of 15-20 per cent, which would be raised to 25 per cent, he said, adding the all-India average being targeted is 10-12 per cent.",

Olectra Greentech Ltd (OGL), a subsidiary of Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Ltd (MEIL), is set to offer the next-generation transport system to the Indian market, a statement stated.  In the wake of the depletion of natural resources and the negative impacts of air pollution and emissions, Olectra has taken the initiative to accelerate the development of Hydrogen-powered buses.  This initiative will help out the Indian government to achieve carbon-free hydrogen ambitions.  Olectra aims to contribute to the nation's environmentally sustainable energy security through its Hydrogen buses, the statement said.  The 12-metre low-floor bus has a customisable seating capacity of 32 to 49 seats for passengers and one driver seat, it informed.  A single hydrogen fill allows the bus to travel up to 400 km. Hydrogen fill for this range coverage takes just about 15 minutes.  When it comes to emissions, these buses generate only water as tailpipe emissions. This is the main unique selling proposition for phasing out old diesel and petrol systems and replacing them with these green buses.  Type-4 hydrogen cylinders are established on the top of the bus. The cylinders can withstand temperatures between (-) 20 and (+) 85 degrees Celsius.  Olectra aims at commercially launching these buses within a year.  Established in 2000, Olectra Greentech is a pioneer in manufacturing electric buses in India. It is also India's largest Silicone Rubber/Composite Insulators manufacturer for power transmission and distribution networks.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: India needs investments to the tune of Rs 33,750 crore to achieve the government PLI target of setting up 50 GWh of lithium-ion cell and battery manufacturing plants, according to a study.  The country requires up to 903 GWh of energy storage to decarbonise its mobility and power sectors by 2030, and lithium-ion batteries will meet the majority of this demand, an independent study released on Tuesday by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said.   India needs investments worth up to Rs 33,750 crore (USD 4.5 billion*) to achieve the government PLI target of setting up 50 GWh of lithium-ion cell and battery manufacturing plants,  CEEW said in the study report.  CEEW, however, noted that at the time of writing the report, the conversion rate was taken as Rs 75 per US dollar.  The CEEW study 'How can India indigenise lithium-ion battery manufacturing?' calculates the material and financial requirements and offers a blueprint for the domestic strategy as India's demand is expected to increase significantly.  Earlier this month, the government announced that 5.9 million tonnes of lithium reserves were found, for the first time in the country, in the Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir.  Lithium is a non-ferrous metal and is one of the key components in electric vehicle batteries.  India's electric vehicle market is expected to hit annual sales of 1-crore units by 2030, according to the Economic Survey 2022-23.  As per industry estimates, the total EV sales in India stood at 10-lakh units in 2022.  The analysis, as per CEEW, is based on the minimum manufacturing plant capacity (5GWh) allocated under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.   For a green future, lithium will be as important as oil and gas are today. It's in India's strategic interest to secure not just the mineral, but also set up the required cell and battery manufacturing systems within the country,  said Rishabh Jain, Senior Programme Lead, CEEW.  It will reduce India's imports in the long-run, and power its grid and EV transition, he said.  To scale up domestic lithium-ion manufacturing, India should step up R&D investments, focus on battery cell component manufacturing and reducing material costs, and support recycling to reduce the need for new materials, he said.  To fulfil the overall battery demand, India will need 969-1,452 kilotonnes of anode, cathode, and electrolyte material (the components for a battery) between 2022 and 2030. This requires the country to prioritise other energy storage technologies as well, according to the study report.  The CEEW study recommends focusing on the strategic sourcing of critical minerals and pushing for research, development and demonstration in all technologies to retain competitiveness.  At the same time, reducing the cost of manufacturing batteries by innovating and updating manufacturing processes, and making policy changes to lower the cost of cell components are important, it said.  Development and deployment of batteries will have far-reaching impacts on India's energy transition journey. Currently, India is import-dependent but the government has already started mobilising resources to indigenise battery cell manufacturing, said Dhruv Warrior, Research Analyst.   The focus on mineral processing and component manufacturing are, however, limited. The study estimates that the share of upstream component manufacturing and material processing can be as high as 61 per cent.  Going forward, India must develop its capabilities to build skills, technology know-how and infrastructure to indigenise this part of the value chain too,  said Warrior.",

The group will invest Rs 650 crore in setting up the plants, generating employment for approximately 240 people, the company said on Monday.Maninder Singh Nayyar, CEO of CEF Group, said,  Uttar Pradesh is the largest state in the country which requires adequate waste management solutions, and we are capable of doing it. This agreement will prove beneficial for the entire state in various regards. The company said organic waste processing plants with captively grown Napier grass will also be utilized, bringing stable earnings for farmers.  This is a direct replacement for chemical fertilizers in commercial farming. Therefore, enabling more scope for sustainable and natural/organic farming on a larger scale. We will be able to produce both biofuels and organic manure resulting in a sustainable environment,  said Nayyar. The group will convert municipal solid waste, agricultural, industrial waste like press mud from sugar mills and other organic wastes into bio-fuels and allied products. The projects will come up in phases, with construction starting by the end of 2023. Different municipalities of Uttar Pradesh will provide the waste and land.At the same time, the overall set-up of the project with offtake arrangements of the Bio-CNG and organic manure or city compost will be processed scientifically in the CEF waste processing plant.",

Emerging and developing economies in Asia are the driving forces behind this faster pace...,  said the report.More than 70 per cent of the increase in global electricity demand is expected to come from China, India and Southeast Asia, it said, with a rider that considerable uncertainties remain over trends in China as its economy emerges from strict Covid restrictions.  The good news is that renewables and nuclear power are growing quickly enough to meet almost all this additional appetite, suggesting we are close to a tipping point for power sector emissions,  said the agency's executive director Fatih Birol.Birol added governments the world over now need to enable low-emission sources to grow even faster and drive down emissions so that the world can ensure secure electricity supplies in line with climate goals.The new IEA report also noted that electricity demand and supply worldwide are becoming increasingly weather dependent, with extreme conditions a recurring theme last year.In addition to the drought in Europe, there were heatwaves in India, resulting in the country's highest-ever peak in power demand. Similarly, central and eastern regions of China were hit by heatwaves and drought, which caused demand for air conditioning to surge. The United States also saw severe winter storms in December, triggering massive power outages. ",

        "articleBody": "India is perfectly situated between Germany and Australia, and can contribute to Europe's green hydrogen supply chain, Stefan Kaufmann said at the Economic Times Global Business Summit. Green hydrogen is climate-neutral hydrogen produced from renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar. Though Europe has a goal to produce around 100 GW of green hydrogen by 2030, the continent will have to import more green hydrogen than it is exporting in the near future, said Kaufmann, former hydrogen commissioner of Germany and advisor to ThyssenKrupp. That is why we have to look outside of Europe-in those regions of the world that are rich in wind and solar power,  he added. Kaufmann said the German government had already put together a hydrogen potential atlas for 31 western African countries, apart from inking a strategic cooperation pact with Australia. Germany's hydrogen supply feasibility study with Australia identifies relevant regulatory, technical and economic obstacles that need to be overcome in order to develop a supply chain for green hydrogen also over long distances. That's where India fits in well, he said. An important message that gives us confidence is that the costs of transporting hydrogen are almost negligible in view of the favourable production conditions in regions with an abundance of sun and wind-such as India. We talk about transport costs of less than 10% of the end price of the hydrogen,  he said. That India is positioning itself in the green hydrogen value chain between Australia and Europe  pays in wonderfully to the Indo-Pacific cooperation strategy of the EU, launched in 2021,  he added. The government of India, as a part of its national green hydrogen mission, plans to manufacture 5 million tonnes annually by 2030. Kaufmann however pointed out what could be India's dilemma in the coming years:  Will you use the green hydrogen to decarbonise your country, or will you export it? There is no doubt that the world has been moving toward hydrogen, a trend indicated by big global investment numbers. Till now, 680 major hydrogen projects with an investment of $240 billion by 2030 have been announced globally, out of which 10% are either under construction or are in operation. Many more such projects are in the offing, something that may lead to the dominance of the hydrogen economy in the years to come.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: TotalEnergies\u2019 decision to pause $4-billion investment in a green hydrogen venture with Adani Group, pending audits of the Indian conglomerate accused of fraud by an US investor, will impact the project\u2019s growth funding as the French energy major was to also guarantee half of its debt, people in the know said.This could be a big blow for the new venture\u2019s timelines of production of green hydrogen at $1 per kg by 2030.Last week, Total said it would not immediately proceed with its latest venture that involved taking a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, as part of an ambitious hydrogen co-development with Adani Enterprises.    97846728In June last year, ANIL and TotalEnergies had outlined a capex plan of $50 billion to set up a 2.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of green H2 manufacturing capacity over the next 10 years, with the first phase of 1.0 mmtpa expected to be commissioned before 2030.What was not publicly disclosed was that, as per the deal terms, Total had made a total of $10-billion capital commitment to the hydrogen venture, standing as guarantor to 50% of the project\u2019s debt, translating to $6 billion, people cited above said.The deal is yet to close.Detailed questionnaire sent to TotalEnergies and Adani group on February 9 did not elicit any response till press time Sunday.\u201cThis project was announced but nothing has been signed\u2026and for now it won\u2019t be signed,\u201d TotalEnergies chief executive Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 had told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cIt makes no sense to add more (projects) until there is clarity.\u201dTotal has just over $3 billion of investments with Adani, including in gas distribution and solar projects, which it has played down as a small 2.4% slice of its total capital commitments.\u201cAdani has other things to deal with now, it\u2019s just good sense to pause things while the audit goes forward,\u201d Pouyanne said.He said TotalEnergies is \u201cnot in charge\u201d of the financial health of Adani group, with whom it has a number of joint ventures.\u201cThe 50% guarantee element was a big benefit for Adani to raise funds as Total enjoys a far superior credit rating,\u201d said an official in the know. \u201cThe economics of the arrangement had been agreed upon. Hopefully, this review will end soon and not get abandoned so that project can kickstart.\u201dVentura Securities Ltd in a detailed report on Adani group in July last year had said the AA rating of TotalEnergies was expected to help ANIL raise low-cost initial funding from the global market, saving 150-200 basis points (bps) in interest costs.TotalEnergies is an active member of several H2-dedicated initiatives and professional associations in Europe. The company is also an anchor sponsor of the \u20ac1.5-billion clean H2 infrastructure fund, which creates the blue H2 ecosystem in Europe.\u201cANIL is targeting the European market for the exports of its green H2, which will generate high margin forex income. The strategic associations of TotalEnergies in Europe could help ANIL in getting access to export its green H2 in the European market,\u201d the Ventura report said.TOTAL SUPPORTAdani can ill afford to lose TotalEnergies\u2019 support, industry players said. Though profitable, Adani Green Energy is highly leveraged at 14 times its historical Ebitda with high capital spending.Moody\u2019s had noted in August that a key credit risk factor for Adani Green Energy, given its debts, was any reduction in the shareholding by TotalEnergies.As part of the partnership, ANIL was to contribute its knowledge of the Indian market, execution capabilities, operations excellence, and capital management philosophy, while TotalEnergies was to bring its understanding of the global market, credit enhancement and financial strength to lower the financing costs along with expertise in underlying technologies.ANIL plans to manufacture green hydrogen and its downstream products such as ammonia, urea, methanol, and ethanol at its Khavda and Mundra SEZ facilities. The Khavda site has a land bank of 71,000 acres, which has a large-scale renewable deployment potential of 20 GW due to its high wind and solar resource potential.The company plans to use the alkaline and PEM electrolysis process to produce 2.5 million tonnes of green H2 annually (by FY31) at Khavda.The electrolysers, used in the electrolysis process, are to be manufactured and supplied from the Mundra SEZ facility.\u201cWe have 40 giga watt of land equivalent. We've been doing solar modules for the past five years. We know we will produce modules at 15 cents to 17 cents,\u201d Robbie Singh, chief financial officer of Adani Enterprises, had told ET on January 22.Low cost of energy extraction will help it produce hydrogen at 30 cents per kg operating costs, he had said. \u201cWe plan to bring it to the market by the first or second quarter of 2026,\u201d Singh had said.H2 will be supplied from Khavda to Mundra SEZ through a 42-inch pipeline (a cost-effective way of transportation), where it will be used for the production of downstream products.TotalEnergies has over 20 years of experience in H2 retailing infrastructure. It is operating 120 H2 refuelling stations across Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. The company is planning to add 150 new HRS (hydrogen retail stations) across Europe by 2030 to further develop the H2 market for mobility in Europe.The tie was to provide a seamless supply of H2 wherein ANIL was expected to become a secured steady source of H2 import.Even before Hindenburg, Adani has been the subject of fierce global criticism for its continued investment in coal mining in India and Australia.Adani's rival Reliance Industries also aims to transition to green hydrogen production by 2025. and has announced $10 billion of investments in giga-factories for solar PV, battery storage, inverters, etc. and $10-12 billion in setting up 20 GW of captive renewable generation capacity augmented with storage.RIL has partnered with Danish climate technology firm Stiesdal to accelerate cost reduction and commercialisation of its pressurized alkaline electrolyser technology. The company is also in talks to partner for electrolyser technology to set up a giga-scale electrolyser manufacturing facility at Jamnagar.",

        "articleBody": "PARIS: A rise in wind and solar production, together with more nuclear electricity, will dominate growth in global power supply over the next three years, curbing the emissions impact of greater energy use, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.  The good news is that renewables and nuclear power are growing quickly enough to meet almost all this additional appetite, suggesting we are close to a tipping point for power sector emissions,  IEA director Faith Birol said. The share of wind and solar in the power generation mix is seen rising to 35% in 2025 from 29% in 2022. Growth in global electricity demand meanwhile is expected to rise by one percentage point from 2022 to an average of 3% over the next three years to 29,281 terawatt-hours (TWh), or double the current consumption of Japan, the report said. Highlighting the need for more clean energy, the IEA linked the rise in the world's energy demand to climate change as heatwaves in India caused the highest peak power demand yet in the country and summer droughts reduced hydropower supplies in Europe. The largest gains in renewable power expected in the Asia Pacific region, with an 11.6% yearly average growth rate, followed by Europe with a 9.4% yearly growth rate, and the Americas, with a 5% growth rate average per year. Asia also dominates demand growth, with more than 70% expected from China, India and south-east Asia, although trends in China are uncertain, the report said. Nuclear supply was seen rising by 3.6% per year on average to 2025, with the largest yearly growth rate in the Middle East at 24.5%, from 26 to 50 TWh, followed by Asia Pacific and Europe, up 6.6% and 4.2% on average per year respectively. Production from gas-fired power plants in Europe is forecast to fall, but significant growth in gas-fired production in the Middle East is likely to limit the decrease, the report said. The IEA projects European gas-fired production falling from the 822 TWh recorded in 2022 to 581 TWh, down 29% in three years, with emissions falling 1,023 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 to 763 Mt CO2, down about 10% per year. Gas-production in the Middle East was forecast to rise from 973 TWh in 2022 to 1,094 TWh in 2025, up 12.4%, though emissions are expected to fall by 14 Mt CO2 over that same period, down 1.9%, as coal power's share is expected to drop to just 4 TWh.",

        "articleBody": "In a first of its kind export deal, Hyderabad-based Greenko Group, plans to supply green ammonia to Germany\u2019s biggest gas trader Uniper, the companies said today.The two firms on Tuesday inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Heads of Terms agreement for exclusive negotiations to supply 250,000 tonnes per annum of green ammonia to Uniper. Although not specified, sources in the know said the offtake agreement is for 8-10 years, starting 2025.Greenko, backed by GIC Holdings, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Japan\u2019s ORIX Corp, will supply the green ammonia from phase one of Greenko ZeroC's 1 million tonne per annum (mtpa) production facility in Kakinada. Industry watchers peg this to be a $300-400 million annual contract.Greenko, Uniper did not reveal the commercial terms of agreement.\u201cWe are partnering with a world-class technology partner in John Cockerill and will jointly develop large-scale green molecule projects in India,  said Anil Chalmalasetty, chief executive officer and founder and managing director of Greenko. Through this offtake agreement for our project which will eventually displace LNG imports and strengthen India\u2019s green molecule ambitions as part of a wider renewable energy program that will see India run the world\u2019s largest energy transition program,  he added.Aside from Green Ammonia, Uniper and Greenko also intend to collaborate on the deployment of similar flexible renewable electricity to other Hydrogen products such as E-Methanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuels, the companies said.Niek den Hollander, CCO of Uniper said,  The Greenko Kakinada project is a very promising opportunity to source green ammonia and secure the supply of low carbon hydrogen products for Germany. Uniper's move comes in the backdrop of an energy crisis faced by the European Union after Russia attacked Ukraine last February. Germany has since been looking at diversifying its energy sourcing. The key differentiator that sets this project apart is the integration of pumped storage plant to balance out the intermittent and seasonality of renewable production and achieve a high annual plant load factor upwards of 85 %, allowing for flexible and dispatchable supply of Green Ammonia competitively,  he added.Green hydrogen is hydrogen produced by splitting water by electrolysis. The hydrogen produced can be combined with nitrogen to make green ammonia, which has multiple applications including fertilizer manufacturing and as a fuel.This is a key element in India\u2019s energy transition. Last month the government launched the Rs 19,700 crore National Green Hydrogen Mission with a target to produce 5 million tonnes (mt) of green hydrogen by 2030.\u201cToday, Indian companies can supply the most competitive green hydrogen/green ammonia due to availability. The availability of the lowest cost for solar power combined with engineering prowess makes India an ideal place for a green hydrogen production hub,  India\u2019s petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri said at the 9th Asian Ministerial Energy Roundtable.Last month, Greenko Group said it would be investing 10,000 crores to set up a Pumped Storage Project (PSP) near Gandhi Sagar in Neemuch District of Madhya Pradesh.In 2022, it partnered with Singapore-based Keppel Infrastructure Holdings Pte Ltd (Keppel Infrastructure) to jointly produce at least 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year.In September Korean steelmaker Posco Holdings partnered with Greenko subsidiary ZeroC for producing Green Hydrogen, Ammonia and related derivatives in India for both the domestic and export markets.The company also partnered with state-run ONGC to develop green ammonia production and storage facilities for export purposes. The facility will have a capacity to produce one million tonne per annum of green ammonia through a 1.3 gigawatts (GW) green hydrogen plant.",

        "articleBody": "India, the world's third largest oil consumer, on Tuesday said it is committed to energy transition but surviving the present and cushioning the vulnerable from price volatilities is essential before moving to clean and green energy.India has committed to net zero carbon emission by 2070 and has repeatedly emphasised that 'dirty' fuels like oil and coal, on which the economy is two-thirds dependent, will have to continue to be in use in the foreseeable future.An immediate shift from low-priced coal and oil to expensive fuels of the future such as hydrogen will entail huge costs in a nation with low per capita income. Unless we survive the present, we will not be able to go into the world of clean and green energy,  Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said at India Energy Week in Bengaluru. While affordable traditional energy resources are essential for meeting the base load requirements, new sources of energy which are cleaner, sustainable, and innovative, are critical for combating the menace of climate change. Geopolitical situations last year led to a spike in prices of crude oil - raw material for petrol and diesel, and rates of natural gas - which is used to make CNG, electricity and fertilizer - shot up to record high. Countries in Europe switched back to coal-fired power plants as gas became unaffordable to many. We have to make sure our transition entails surviving the present and cushioning vulnerable from volatility,  he said, adding the transition has to be affordable and sustainable particularly for vulnerable sections. We are actively conscious of the need to facilitate energy transition and in the interim insulate consumers. India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and roughly half of its gas requirement too comes from overseas. And the spike in global energy prices meant it had to shell out more for imports. To insulate domestic consumers, it had to cut taxes as well as ask oil companies to hold prices. Affordable energy is a vital ingredient to achieving inclusive economic growth and energy justice,  he said adding economies worldwide, particularly the emerging economies, are facing the daunting task of safeguarding energy security, affordability and accessibility which has created the cost-of-living crisis.On one hand, advanced economies committed over USD 500 billion in funds to support and shield consumers and secure alternative fuel supplies by temporarily reverting to nuclear and higher carbon intensity (coal, oil) to fill the energy supply gap, on the other hand some economies have continued to exacerbate fuel poverty and food insecurity, he said. As it appears, the inevitable shift in the global energy landscape is a reality. We now need to ensure that this change is rooted in energy security and energy justice, which are also the most important component of the energy vision of India,  he said. Going forward as the challenges are likely to only become more acute, the value of preparedness against such potential shock is going to start an era of building resilience,  Puri said adding the energy crisis has a ripple effect on other sectors as well.The unprecedent high level of gas prices has created a fertilizer crisis which in turn has created food security concerns. Further, the high energy and commodity prices have raised inflationary concerns and many countries are facing recessionary fears. The energy transition will be more of a wave of managed change in the global energy portfolio versus an event, ensuring energy access and security, whilst progressing to net-zero. Achieving the net-zero goal requires global coordination and access to skills, technology, and global financing,  he said.For that reason, it is likely to be a ride, that involves a variety of energy solutions to drive to net-zero - drawing on renewables, nuclear, and advanced biofuels, as well as the critical role of gas in the energy transition, whether from current supplies of natural gas, LNG and LPG or into a future shaped by their low carbon alternatives in the form of hydrogen, ammonia and green LPG. India's energy transition, therefore, is extraordinary not just in terms of scale and coverage but also in creating hope and a blueprint for the world's developing nations who are facing similar challenges. India is undertaking an ambitious journey of the energy transition to achieve net carbon zero by 2070. However, this transition has to be stable and just to ensure that it is sustainable, India is using a mix of increased use of electricity generated from renewable sources, biofuels, nuclear and hydrogen for the transition, he said.Puri said there is a pressing need to galvanise global efforts for  mapping stable and secure energy pathways for achieving energy security, energy justice, growth and innovation .Asian economies, he said, have not only managed to bounce back fastest from the impacts of the pandemic but have also made significant progress toward clean energy. While the past century marked the end of colonialism in Asia, the present century is marked by the remarkable growth story of Asia due to its demographic dividend and innovation,  he said.The Asian share of global GDP has risen from 38 per cent to 45 per cent and is likely to exceed 50 per cent by 2030. The Asian economy has grown at an average 5.5 per cent over the preceding two decades and registered growth of 6.5 per cent in 2021, while it is expected to moderate to 4 per cent in 2022 amid an uncertain global environment and rise to 4.3 per cent in 2023.

        "articleBody": "Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) and Ashok Leyland on Monday unveiled India\u2019s first Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine (H2-ICE) powered truck at the India Energy Week in Bengaluru.RIL and Ashok Leyland, the Indian flagship company of the Hinduja Group and India\u2019s leading commercial vehicle manufacturer, were working on developing this technology over the past year.ET had in its December 8 edition reported that both companies were working on H2-ICE powered trucks.RIL, which contracts a fleet of nearly 45,000 trucks every year to move goods for its refining and marketing operations, is interested in powering them with green hydrogen which it would be producing at its Jamnagar facility in a few years.Green hydrogen is the cleanest form of fuel when produced through renewable sources of energy. According to a June 2022 report by Niti Aayog on Harnessing Green Hydrogen, increasing consumption from steel and heavy-duty trucking sectors will be the long-term driver for hydrogen, with demand of almost 11 million tonnes per year by 2030 and accounting for almost 52% of total demand by 2050.Heavy duty trucks are the biggest emitter, producing 60% of road-freight CO2 emissions, which is expected to increase to 66% by 2050.The vehicle which RIL and Ashok Leyland unveiled has an architecture similar to a conventional diesel-based combustion engine.N Saravanan, President and Chief Technology Officer of Ashok Leyland, in a statement, said, \u201cWorking with RIL, we have once again demonstrated our technological leadership, and our commitment to the Clean Mobility Mission. Having one of the best R&D teams in the country, we want to continue our path to innovate and leverage new technologies to be a leader in sustainable and environment friendly mobility.\u201dAshok Leyland had recently demonstrated its futuristic vehicle range, powered by electric and hydrogen options at Auto Expo 2023.",

She also announced a five million tonne target for green hydrogen production by 2030.  India is moving forward to net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. An outlay of Rs 19,700 crore for the Green Hydrogen Mission will facilitate transmission to low carbon intensity and also reduce dependence on fossil fuels,  she said in her Budget speech. With a vision to make India an energy-independent nation and to de-carbonise critical sectors, the government approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission on January 4, 2023, with an initial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore.The Centre is also supporting the setting up of battery energy storage of 4,000 MwH, she said, adding that a green credit programme will be also notified under the Environment Protection Act.According to a Reuters report, the Indian government is aiming to cut green hydrogen prices by a fifth in the next five years. The budget prioritizes the adoption of green fuel, energy, and building practices to reduce carbon intensity and create new green job opportunities. The government's commitment to this  green growth  approach is a step towards building a cleaner and more prosperous future for all Indians. This is in the direction of India seeking a leadership role in mitigating the global climate crisis,  says Gaurav Kedia, Chairman of the Indian Biogas Association. Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, Adani Enterprises, JSW Energy and Acme Solar are all in the green hydrogen game, with the Adani Group having a tie-up with France\u2019s TotalEnergies.",

        "articleBody": "Green hydrogen will be crucial for India's economic development, energy security and achieving decarbonisation of harder to abate sectors, according to the Economic Survey 2022-23. The survey tabled in the Parliament on Tuesday stated that from the emerging global momentum on green hydrogen, India can situate this decarbonisation opportunity not just within the context of a low-carbon economy but also as an enabler of energy security and economic development for the nation.  Green hydrogen will be crucial for achieving decarbonisation of harder-to-abate sectors such as fertilisers, refining, methanol, maritime shipping, iron & steel and long-haul transport, the survey said.  Further, the survey said that green hydrogen is also an important element of India's Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS).  With a vision to make India an energy-independent nation, and to de-carbonise critical sectors, the government approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission on January 4, 2023 with an initial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore.  The mission will facilitate demand creation, production, utilisation and export of green hydrogen and mobilisation of over Rs 8 lakh crore of investments by 2030.  As per the survey, the energy transition plan is complemented by numerous policies intended to improve the ecosystem to deploy promising technological innovations like green hydrogen.  The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047.  In June 2022, a report by NITI Aayog showed that in the case of India, renewable tariffs have fallen in recent years, and electrolyser costs are expected to fall in the future.  A recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (2020) suggested that the cost of electrolysers is crucial for making green hydrogen economically viable.  NITI Aayog's report estimates that the cumulative value of the green hydrogen market in India will be USD 8 billion by 2030 and USD 340 billion by 2050.  The electrolyser market will be approximately USD 5 billion by 2030 and USD 31 billion by 2050.  The country has consistently modified/amended regulatory standards and adopted policy level interventions to support the development and adoption of new technology, the survey said.  India's progress on energy transition may be understood from the fact that it has enhanced its non-fossil fuel-based installed capacity target to 50 per cent in its updated NDC as the target of 40 per cent of the first NDC was achieved well in advance.",

It was the first year when investment in the energy transition equaled global investment in fossil fuels, according to the latest data release from clean energy research group BloombergNEF.The money flowing into the upstream, midstream and downstream segments of oil and gas, and into fossil fuel-fired power generation without emissions reduction technology, was $1.1 trillion last year. Likewise, annual investment in renewable energy, electrified transport and heat, energy storage and other technologies reached $1.1 trillion.But 2022 was also a milestone in another sense \u2014 as the first year when investment in decarbonizing energy surpassed $1 trillion. The year-on-year increase of more than $250 billion from 2021 was the largest jump yet.Renewable energy and electrified transport reaped most of those dollars. Those sectors were buoyed by soaring installations of wind and solar \u2014 with more than 350 gigawatts of assets built \u2014 and sales of 10-million-plus electric vehicles globally.97359450Although renewable energy saw record investment in 2022, electrified transport is growing at a faster rate. Passenger EVs account for the bulk of the transport dollars invested ($380 billion) but by no means all of that sector\u2019s capital flow last year. Public charging infrastructure saw an influx of $24 billion, while nearly $23 billion was spent on electric 2-and 3-wheelers. Electric buses got $15 billion, and commercial electric vehicles such as trucks received $8 billion.BNEF tracks six other sectors in the energy transition, and all but one of them (nuclear) also set annual investment records last year. The two smallest sectors for investment, shown below, are also worth noting. Carbon capture received $6.3 billion in 2022 and hydrogen a little over $1 billion.However, both grew significantly in relative terms: Carbon capture investment almost tripled while hydrogen investment more than tripled. Both technologies have made big promises in the past half-decade, and investment is now following. But there will need to be orders of magnitude more use of them to have a substantial climate impact.Inflation did play a role in the increase in invested dollars last year \u2014 but not that much of a role, given that inflation in the range of 8% is less than a third of the total year-on-year dollar increase.Inflation drove up costs of components, construction and financing for energy across the board. Yet expansion in nearly every sector increased total dollars invested much more.A trillion dollars invested in a year is something. It is also short of what is needed. In order to get on track for net zero emissions in 2050, the world would need to immediately triple this $1.1 trillion spend \u2014 and add hundreds of billions of dollars more for the global power grid.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Billionaire Gautam Adani's group plans to spin off businesses like hydrogen, airports and data centre between 2025 and 2028 after they achieve a certain investment profile, it's Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh said. Adani Enterprises Ltd, which is looking to raise Rs 20,000 crore in a follow-on share sale, is the business incubator for the group. Over the years, businesses such as ports, power and city gas were first incubated in AEL before being spun off or demerged into separate listed companies.  AEL currently houses new businesses such as hydrogen, where the group plans to invest USD 50 billion over the next 10 years across the value chain, flourishing airport operations, mining, data centre and roads and logistics.   The businesses have to achieve a basic investment profile and maturity before being considered for a demerger. Between 2025 and 2028 we think these businesses can achieve the desired levels for a demerger,  Singh told PTI.  The group is looking to become one of the lowest cost producers of hydrogen -- a fuel of the future that has zero carbon footprint. It is also betting big on its airport business with an aim to become the largest service base in the country in the coming years, outside of government services.  Adani, 60, started as a trader and has been on a rapid diversification spree, expanding an empire centred on ports and coal mining to include airports, data centres and cement as well as green energy. He now owns a media company too.  Singh said the follow-on share sale is aimed at widening the shareholder base by bringing in more retail, high networth and institutional investors.  This would also address concerns of liquidity by increasing the free float, he said, adding the company wants to increase the participation of retail investors and that is why it chose a primary issue instead of a rights issue.  AEL will use the money raised to fund green hydrogen projects, airport facilities and greenfield expressways, besides paring some of its debt.  It will sell shares in a price band of Rs 3,112 to Rs 3,276 apiece in the follow-on public offer (FPO), slated to open on January 27 and close on January 31, according to the offer letter.  Of the Rs 20,000 crore proceeds of the FPO, Rs 10,869 crore will be used for green hydrogen projects, work at the existing airports and construction of a greenfield expressway. Another Rs 4,165 crore will go towards repayment of debt taken by its airports, road and solar project subsidiaries.  AEL has been the vehicle for most of the new business expansion of Adani.  Its current business portfolio includes a green hydrogen ecosystem, data centres, developing airports, developing roads, food FMCG, digital, mining, defence and industrial manufacturing, among others.  As of September 30, 2022, it had Rs 40,023.50 crore in borrowing.",

        "articleBody": "The National Green Hydrogen Mission is a  significant step  towards achieving the country's net-zero targets and and will help in reducing input costs of clean energy source, besides generating lakhs of job opportunities in the renewable energy sector, experts say. The Union Cabinet on January 4 approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission, which aims to make India a global manufacturing hub and a clean source of energy.  The objective of the Mission is also development of a production capacity of at least 5 MMT (Million Metric Tonnes) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.   I expect that the emphasis on demand creation, incentives and partnerships will kick-start the green hydrogen industry in the country and enable Indian companies to be on a level footing with the global energy suppliers.   The industry is ready to support India's clean energy transition,  Sumant Sinha, Chairman and CEO, ReNew Power.  Sinha, who is also the president of industry body Assocham, termed the launch of the mission  a significant step  towards helping India achieve net-zero targets.  Ishver Dholakiya, MD of Goldi Solar said the program will facilitate production, utilisation, and export, along with generation of lakhs of job opportunities in the renewable energy sector.  The incentives will help bring down the cost of input materials like electrolysers, which will help local players to become competitive at the global level, he said.  Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd said the round-the-clock procurement of renewable energy at competitive rates remains extremely critical for an improvement in the utilisation of electrolysers.  The timely implementation of the proposed PLI scheme to incentivize/promote the domestic manufacturing of electrolysers will be critical, he said.  Abhay Kumar Singh, ex-CMD of state-owned NHPC, said the cost of per kg hydrogen comes to around USD 3 at present. With the government's ambitious mission it will be less than half in the times to come.   In April 2022, when I was CMD NHPC, the company had signed an agreement with the Himachal government to develop a pilot green hydrogen mobility project including hydrogen production,  he said.  The mission will give a boost to investment sentiments of more and more interest players, Singh said.",

        "articleBody": "The number and scale of projects using and making hydrogen, a gas that releases energy when burned without emitting carbon dioxide, is rapidly growing. If its construction goes to plan, a Euro 2.5 billion (GBP 2.18 billion) undersea pipeline will convey  green hydrogen  from Spain to France from 2030.  In the US, some power stations are being upgraded to allow hydrogen to be blended with fossil gas, and the Norwegian oil company Equinor is teaming up with Thermal SSE to build a 1,800 megawatt (MW)  blue hydrogen  power plant in Britain.  Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan in March which includes deploying 50,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and early December saw the first hydrogen-fuelled tractors and forklifts leave the assembly line at a new plant in Guangdong province.  Hydrogen is produced in multiple ways. A colour spectrum is used to render it simple.   Grey  and  brown/black  hydrogen come from fossil gas (methane) and coal (brown or black coal) respectively - a process that, for every tonne of hydrogen, emits between ten and 12 tonnes of CO\u2082 for grey hydrogen and 18 to 20 for brown.   Blue  is the same process except the carbon dioxide is supposed to be captured and stored underground. And  green  hydrogen is conventionally defined as generated from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity.  But only 0.04 per cent of hydrogen is green, and blue hydrogen is less than 1 per cent.  The rest is grey or brown, most of which is used in oil refineries and for manufacturing ammonia and methanol. It's an enormous industry which emits more CO\u2082 than all of Britain and France combined.  It is widely hoped that a silver lining of today's high gas prices will be green hydrogen becoming a cost-competitive alternative to dirty fuels in boilers, shipping tankers and steelworks furnaces.  Unfortunately, without electricity market reform, this opportunity is likely to be squandered.  And while the buzz around the hydrogen economy intensifies, a closer look suggests the fuel is less a spearhead for a green transition and more the subject of an elaborate bait-and-switch operation by oil companies.  Hydrogen's true colours Green hydrogen is essential for decarbonisation: to replace fossil fuels in steelmaking, ammonia production for fertilisers and possibly shipping and trucking - processes which are difficult to electrify.  Some green hydrogen is crosshatched with dirtier hues. So it's not simply that in its production a lot of energy is wasted in the double transformation from electricity to gas and then fuel.  But burning hydrogen also emits nitrogen oxides, air pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain.  If green hydrogen production is scaled up to play a significant economic role by 2050, its freshwater demand will exceed one-quarter of today's global annual consumption, risking water scarcity in some regions.  Above all, hydrogen is meaningfully green only if the renewable energy that generates it cannot be fed into the grid to replace power from gas or coal plants.  Blue hydrogen relies on a similar - but much more harmful - trick of the light. For hydrogen to be true blue, the emissions must be captured and securely stored.  In theory, carbon capture and storage works but nearly all plants use the captured carbon to pump more oil and many have been shut down as failures. Only a handful store carbon indefinitely and even these consume lots of energy and capture only some of the CO\u2082, which can leak.  Blue hydrogen's main source is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is notorious for escaping drilling wells and pipelines. Research suggests that these issues make blue hydrogen worse for the climate than fossil gas.  In the EU, as in many economies, electricity pricing is based on the principle of marginal costs, which means that the most expensive source (typically fossil gas) sets the wholesale power price.  During sunny or windy spells, a glut of renewable energy generation can slash electricity prices, freeing them from the grip of natural gas prices for a few hours at a time.  This is often not enough to justify investments in the electrolysers which produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen won't gain the necessary price advantage over blue hydrogen and fossil gas until electricity markets are restructured.  Meanwhile, the high price of oil and gas has turbocharged the industry's expansion.  The US government is exhorting oil and fracking firms to  drill baby drill . Britain's government is to award more than 100 licenses to drill for oil and gas and colossal new fossil fuel investments have been announced across the Middle East and Africa.  In a few years when these new sources come onstream, and particularly if economic growth continues to slow and depress energy demand, gas and oil will become cheaper again - until the next price spike prompts new rounds of investment, and the infernal cycle continues.  The owners of newly-built wells, pipelines and terminals will fight to defend those assets and stall decarbonisation.  Now fossil-fuel firms are rebranding themselves as agents of  carbon management.   The aim is to prevent their assets from getting stranded by repurposing them, presenting a largely fictional substance, blue hydrogen, as a low-carbon  bridge  to an unspecified green future.  Other sectors have joined the oil-led coalition. As the engineer Tom Baxter observes, gas network operators and boiler manufacturers see their survival in this ploy. Utilities are similarly keen, as hydrogen's inefficiencies allow them to sell more power.  Tackling this stalling operation requires public policy.  Governments will need to regulate or tax carbon out of the market while simultaneously ramping up renewables.  The approach to electricity pricing also needs to shift, to decouple the prices of electricity generated from renewables and fossil gas.  The marginal pricing system hugely benefits renewable project owners, since they profit from high electricity prices and effectively zero input costs.  An alternative market structure would set rewards for generators according to their average costs plus a slight surplus which could be reinvested into deploying more renewables and other green technologies, providing consumers with cheap electricity. This can only be achieved through a robustly regulated market or by nationalising energy companies and setting prices and production.  These interventions would give green hydrogen a competitive advantage over blue or grey variants, one that could be furthered with other subsidies, such as tax credits on the model of the US Inflation Reduction Act. Above all, energy demand must be reduced to ease upward pressure on price.  In any future energy system, hydrogen will have a role. But its expansion must be carefully designed, to prevent the promise of green hydrogen disguising the risks of its blue and grey cousins.",

The group will comprise Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, NITI Aayog CEO, and secretaries of various ministries besides departments of scientific and industrial research, promotion of industry and internal trade, and experts from the industry, according to the Mission Document.  The Union Cabinet on January 4 approved the mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore to make India a global hub for the manufacturing of this clean source of energy, and development of a production capacity of at least 5 MMT (Million Metric Tonnes) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.  The effective implementation of the Mission requires strong coordination among various ministries and departments of central and state governments, industry, institutions, and other stakeholders.  A flexible and result-oriented governance structure will be created for steering and guiding the implementation of the Mission, which was cleared by the Union Cabinet last week, the document stated.  Accordingly, an Empowered Group (EG) chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and comprising Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, NITI Aayog CEO, and secretaries of various ministries besides departments of scientific and industrial research, promotion of industry and internal trade, and experts from the industry will be set up, it said.  The EG will oversee the mission activities, provide guidance, continuously monitor progress, recommend policy interventions to be made in furtherance of mission objectives and approve mid-course corrections if required.  A National Green Hydrogen Advisory Group comprising experts from academic and research institutions, industry, and civil society will also be constituted to advise the EG on all science and technology related matters pertaining to the Mission.  It will carry out technology gap analysis for various aspects of the value chain and accordingly define broad performance and cost targets based on global benchmarking.  The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) will be the nodal coordinating ministry for the Mission and will undertake the overarching policy formulation and programme implementation with an aim to scale up production of green hydrogen, green ammonia and other derivatives and enable cost reduction. The government has also identified several risk factors which will be dealt with timely action through necessary policy changes to make the National Green Hydrogen Mission a success, it said.   The success in achieving the outcomes of this mission is dependent on several factors. It will require constant monitoring, indexing, and sufficient flexibility for mid-course corrections. The underlying governance framework will be tasked with risk identification, classification and timely-action through necessary policy changes,  according to the mission document.  The mission seeks to minimise various risks through an appropriate mix of financial and non-financial levers, and review mechanisms. These will be monitored regularly by the mission secretariat through regular consultations with stakeholders.   An indicative categorization and associated management/mitigation measures for the likely risks are detailed (mission in the document),  it said.  Strategic risks like supply chain disruptions in critical inputs will be dealt with measures like diversification in supply chains.  Diversification of technology options, funding of multiple R&D and pilot threads, besides collaborative platforms for industry, academia and startups will be prepared to deal with technology disruptions and unforeseen developments.  Steps will also be taken to mitigate operational/project level risks involving water availability, land availability and safety concerns.  The government will take measures like demand creation in identified sectors, planning of RE capacity addition, and  risk sharing framework in procurement, facilitating projects to access FDI, bond markets, MFAs  to avert financial and market risks.",

        "articleBody": "The government on Friday said the overall ethanol production capacity in India is expected to go up by 25 per cent to 1,250 crore litres by the end of this year, as proactive steps have been taken for faster clearance of projects. A single-window clearance has been put in place wherein ethanol projects seeking interest subvention and environment clearances are given faster clearance.  As on today, more than Rs 20,000 crore worth loans have been sanctioned by the banks for ethanol projects, Out of which Rs 10,000 crore has already been disbursed under the interest subvention scheme,  said Sangeet Singla, Director of Sugar and Vegetable Oils under the aegis of the Union Food Ministry.  Around 225 projects have been benefited so far, he said, speaking at a conference on  Fuels for future' organised by industry body Assocham here.  India has doubled ethanol blending with petrol to 10 per cent in the last two years. Ethanol blending will reach 12 per cent this year and meet the target of 25 per cent by 2025, he added.  Expressing confidence that many distilleries are coming up in the country, Singla said,  We are having more than 1,000 crore litre capacity this year. By the end of 2023, we will have 1,250 crore litre plus. This is the pace at which we are building our capacity in the country.   Out of 1,000 crore litre capacity that India has today, sugar and grains-based ethanol is in the ratio of 70:30, he said, adding that these capacities are not only meeting the requirement of fuels but also all other industry uses including portable alcohol.  The official said that not only sugarcane growers, farmers growing grains are also getting benefitted from ethanol making, as they are getting better rates for broken rice.  Besides sugar, the government has allowed the use of broken rice for ethanol production. However, there are concerns about the availability of grains, he said.  The official mentioned that the government is keen to diversify the basket of ethanol in multiple ways. One way is generation of 2G ethanol where Indian Oil Corporation has already commissioned one plant in Panipat.   We are also promoting cultivation of maize. As of now, maize is allowed for feed stock but it is used on a limited scale. We are requesting states to promote cultivation of maize, which will lead towards water friendly fuel,  he added.  Singla said the government is coordinating with various ministries and stakeholders involved in the ethanol industry for producing greener fuels.   ... Climate change is a big change. In our opinion, there is no choice but to fall in line and adopt the greener fuels,  he said.  There are multiple alternative greener fuels like hydrogen, electric vehicles, and ethanol but blend of these fuels can be the way forward, he added.  Speaking at the event, Counselor of Public Diplomacy (Trade and Economic Affairs) at Brazil Embassy in India, Paulo Chiarelli, said:  Brazil has more than 40 years of experience in ethanol production and it is keen to have a knowledge partnership with India.   The two major sugar producing nations in the world can play an important role in ethanol trade at the global level, he added.  Sugar Technologists' Association of India (STAI) President Sanjay Awasthi, GAIL India Executive Director Atul Kumar Tripathi and ICRA Ltd senior Vice President and Group Head Shamsher Dewan also spoke about greener fuels and challenges ahead.  A knowledge report was also released on the occasion.",

        "articleBody": "India has set green hydrogen consumption targets for some industries, so as to generate demand for cleaner fuel in its quest to reach net zero by 2070, the government said on Friday, as it unveiled its policy for green energy. One of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, India approved a plan of incentives worth more than $2 billion last week to develop a green hydrogen production capacity of 5 million tonnes a year by 2030. Asia's third-largest economy wants to use green hydrogen to replace grey hydrogen, produced using gas, as it moves to decarbonise sectors such as oil and fertilisers. Green hydrogen is a zero-carbon fuel made by electrolysis, using renewable power from wind and solar to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. India's top refiner Indian Oil Corp, top power utility NTPC Ltd and conglomerates including Reliance and Adani group have announced plans to build green hydrogen projects. To gradually build a hydrogen-powered shipping lines, India has set a goal for its largest fleet operator, the state-run Shipping Corp of India, to retrofit at least two ships to run on green hydrogen-based fuels by 2027. All the state-run oil and gas companies that charter 40 vessels for fuel transport will also have to hire at least one ship powered by green hydrogen each year from 2027 to 2030.  Green ammonia bunkers and refueling facilities will be set up at least at one port by 2025,  the government said in its policy document. Such facilities will be established at all major ports by 2035.  India aims to end imports of ammonia-based fertiliser by 2034 to 2035, replacing them with locally produced green ammonia-based soil nutrients. The government will also invite bids to set up two domestic green hydrogen-based urea and diammonium phosphate plants. The policy also requires new steel plants to be capable of operating on green hydrogen.",

        "articleBody": "India will by May invite bids for subsidies for setting up green-hydrogen manufacturing and utilisation hubs, fertiliser and steel plants based on the fuel, and factories for making electrolysers, two government sources told Reuters. The bidding process is part of a first phase of a $2 billion incentive plan announced last week to boost use of green hydrogen to cut emissions and make India a major exporter in the field. Green hydrogen is hydrogen made with renewable energy. The plan aims at using it in fertiliser and steel production in place of hydrogen made with fossil fuels, blending it into urban gas supply gas and promoting its use in transportation.  The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy did not respond to a query sent by Reuters. Establishing electrolyser factories and hubs for making and using green hydrogen could attract interest from such big companies such as Reliance Group and Adani Group, which have already committed billions of dollars to green-hydrogen activities. Electrolysers are devices for making hydrogen. The government will call witin three to four months for competitive bids for establishing two green hydrogen hubs, two government sources, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. In the same period it will seek bids for setting up two fertiliser plants using green hydrogen and green ammonia - ammonia made with green hydrogen - they said. It will subsidise establshment of the activities proposed by the winning bidders, which will retain ownership. The government intends to award contracts within a year, both sources said. Other countries are working in this field, but high costs of transporting and storing hydrogen and of making electrolysers are key issues that need to be resolved The plan, called the National Green Hydrogen Mission, aims at substituting all ammonia-based fertiliser imports with domestic fertilisers using green ammonia by 2034-35.  The government wants India to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030. Similarly, steel projects using 100% green hydrogen will be set up, according to two sources.  The hydrogen plan is to be implemented in phases. Up to 2025-26, sectors already using hydrogen will be converted to green hydrogen and low-cost electrolyser manufactuing will be set up.  In the second phase, between 2026-27 and 2029-30, production of commercial-scale green hydrogen in steel and mobility sectors will be explored, the two officials said.  The phase 1 projects will begin manufacturing in two years, the two officials said.",

And with the recently approved National Green Hydrogen Mission, India aims to achieve leadership in this field by 2030. Sanjay Dutta explainsWhat is green hydrogen?Hydrogen produced by electrolysing water, using electricity from solar or wind power projects, is designated \u2018green\u2019 hydrogen \u2013 or increasingly, just GH2.Why is GH2 seen as the \u2018fuel of the future\u2019?It is considered the cleanest fuel because its production or consumption does not leave any carbon trail. But it requires large amounts of energy to produce. 96896272What do hydrogen\u2019s colour codes signify?The colour codes indicate the source. Grey hydrogen extracted from natural gas is the most common type in use at present. Brown hydrogen is produced through gasification of coal. This process emits greenhouse gases as a byproduct. Blue hydrogen is tapped from greenhouse gases locked up in carbon capture and storage facilities.What are the applications of hydrogen?At present hydrogen use is limited to large industries, such as oil refineries, steel, fertilisers and bulk chemicals. A major application will be for blending with CNG and PNG, to clean up their emissions.When was the GH2 mission launched?PM Narendra Modi first laid out the plan at the third renewable energy investors meet in November 2020. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman articulated the roadmap by announcing the mission in her Budget speech on February 1, 2021. The power ministry on February 17, 2022 notified GH2 and green ammonia policy enablers. Finally, the Cabinet approved an incentive package to seed the market on January 4 this year.What is the Hydrogen Mission\u2019s aim?To strengthen India\u2019s pole position in climate action and energy transition as well as reduce dependence on energy imports. GH2 can potentially lead to savings of Rs 1 lakh crore in India\u2019s energy import bill and cut out 68% of expensive gas shipments by replacing traditional industrial fuel/feedstock. The government sees India meeting 10% of g lobal GH2 demand by 2030.How much does hydrogen cost?Prices of hydrogen vary according to source, market conditions and currency rates. GH2 currently costs Rs 300/kg. The average cost of grey hydrogen extracted from natural gas \u2013 the commonly used form of hydrogen \u2013 averaged Rs 130/kg but has been Rs 200-250/kg sincethe Ukraine conflict.How much incentive is India offering to develop a GH2 ecosystem?A little over $2 billion. Most of this money will go towards supporting 15GW (gigawatts) of domestic electrolyser manufacturing capacity by 2030. By then the government believes India will have a capacity of 60GW, expected to be the largest in the world. The remaining funds will be used for strategic intervention to help projects.How many other countries are promoting GH2?Official documents indicate 25 countries are chasing the GH2 dream with support from their governments. Germany is offering the highest support at $10. 3 billion, followed by the US with $9 billion, France $8. 2 billion and the European Union $4. 3 billion.Which Indian companies are investing in GH2 projects?State-run IndianOil and GAIL have announced commercial scale GH2 plans. NTPC this week became the first entity to blend PNG with GH2. GAIL and IOC have pilots for blending CNG with grey hydro gen. Oil India Ltd is running hydrogen buses in Kaziranga National Park, Assam. In the private sector, Reliance Industries Ltd, Adani Group and ACME Group have mega-size plans for manufacturing electrolysers, as well as GH2 and green ammonia units.What are the drawbacks of hydrogen?Hydrogen is highly inflammable due to its high energy density and is risky to transport or store. This means either GH2 plants must be set up near consumption sites and green power wheeled from afar, or the gas must be converted into liquid ammonia for transporting. Both options impact the overall project economics.",

        "articleBody": "About half a dozen domestic and global energy developers, including Adani Green, Torrent Power, Shell and Actis, are looking to acquire Virescent Renewable Energy Trust, an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) owned by KKR India, for an enterprise value of $550million (\u20b94,500 crore), sources said.The trust has a portfolio of 16 operational solar power projects, aggregating to 538 MW, across 7 states. If the deal materialises, this could be the first sale of an InvIT in India. The contenders have submitted non-binding offers recently and are currently negotiating with KKR and its advisors JP Morgan who will proceed with a smaller group of shortlisted candidates for the next round of negotiations and due diligence, the sources mentioned above added. The trust's initial portfolio of assets comprised 9 operational solar power projects, aggregating to 394 MW, in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Gujarat & Uttar Pradesh. Subsequently, the Trust added another 7 operational solar power projects, aggregating to 144 MW, in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh & Punjab. All 16 projects have long term Power Purchase Agreements for 25 years, with Central & State Government offtakers. Terra Asia Holdings II Pte. is the sponsor to the Trust and is an affiliate of the funds, advised by affiliates of KKR.  The potential sale of InviT would be a complicated one,  said one of the persons cited above. As the sponsor can't hold more than 75% stake in the InviT, the new investor needs the approval from other minority shareholders to become a co- sponsor and acquire a majority stake. The potential buyer, for becoming a co-sponsor, needs to intimate Sebi and then seek approval from the other unit holders.   96863995 In case the minority shareholders don't agree, the potential buyer has to provide an exit to them which would create more complexities and further delay the process,  he added. Mails sent to Actis, Torrent Power, Adani Green, Shell did not elicit any responses till the press time. A KKR spokesperson declined to comment. The pooled structure of the InvIT results in a well-diversified mix of assets and the cash flows from the pool of 14 assets, having an operational track record of three-to-nine years, are robust, said a recent India Ratings report. The projects are located across 7 states, minimising the impact of any one-time resource-related risks at isolated locations to an extent, it added. Virescent, set up in 2020, raised Rs460 crore ($62 million) from a group of foreign and domestic investors including Canada's Alberta Investment Management Corporation. KKR invested in VRET from its Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors Fund.",

I\u2019m glad Norway can contribute to enable expansion of renewables in India through investing in transmission lines,\u201d according to Norwegian Ambassador Hans Jacob Frydenlund. \u201cInvestment in the transmission sector provides synergies with our core RE portfolio and demonstrates our success in capital recycling. As a leader in India's energy transition, we are excited to partner with Norfund and KLP to support India\u2019s green energy transition and look forward to strengthening this partnership in the future\u201d, according to Sumant Sinha, Chairman, and CEO of ReNew Power.\u201cThrough this investment we are contributing to the connection of 2.5 GW of planned renewable power in the south being connected to the national grid. We are pleased to make Norfund\u2019s and the Climate Investment Fund\u2019s first investment in the sector, and we look forward to strengthening our partnership with Renew,\u201d according to Bj\u00f8rnar Baugerud, Vice President, Clean Energy in Norfund.The project will consist of a 5 x 500 MVA 400/220 kV sub-station at Koppal with 400 kV D/C quad moose transmission line from Koppal substation to Narendra New substation and 400 kV GIS Extn at Narendra New in Karnataka (Koppal Project). Its commercial operations are expected to start in the first quarter of FY24.\u201cThis investment will reduce bottlenecks in the Indian transmission system and open the way for new renewable power generation to produce electricity to meet rising Indian demand. We expect the project to both generate attractive returns and have a strong climate impact,\u201d according to Aage Schaanning, Chief Financial Officer at KLP.Operational since May, Norway\u2019s new Climate Investment Fund, managed by Norfund, will reduce and avoid emissions by investing in renewable energy in developing countries with significant emissions from coal power and other fossil fuels. The fund has already made two previous investments in India \u2013 in a large-scale solar park with Enel and in Fourth Partner Energy, India\u2019s leading developer of distributed solar energy solutions.The new Norwegian Climate Investment Fund received 1 billion NOK in the state budget for 2022, matched by an equal sum from Norfund\u2019s capital, and the Parliament has now approved another 1 billion for 2023. The plan is for the fund to reach 10 billion NOK within five years.\u201cNorfund has identified potential investments for over 8 billion NOK. Faced with the total needs, our contributions are moderate, but there are great possibilities for scaling up,\u201d noted Baugerud.",

        "articleBody": "Union New and Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh on Thursday said his ministry will come out with detailed guidelines and standards for making India a global hub for hydrogen manufacturing. The comment comes a day after the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore.   We will come out with a detailed order after clearance by the Cabinet,  Singh said during a media interaction.  The Mission is expected to attract Rs 8 lakh crore of investment to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen per annum in the next five years.  The incentives provided under the Mission are aimed at bringing down the cost of green hydrogen.   We have decided that electrolysers can be made in India. So, we have worked out the PLI (production linked incentive) scheme for their domestic manufacturing that will cover manufacture of 15 gigawatts (GW) capacity. But we expect the capacity to be established to be almost in the region of 60 GW (by 2030),  he added.  Singh pointed out that this (60 GW) will be the world's largest electrolyser manufacturing capacity.   We will announce a date up till which domestic industry will be allowed to import electrolysers at lower import duties, let's say by 2025-26. By 2025-26, we expect the domestic manufacturing capacity to come up. Thereafter, heavy import duties will kick-in, and we don't expect anybody to import electrolysers,  the minister stated.  The PLI scheme on green hydrogen manufacturing will be available for the first few years till the domestic industry becomes competitive, Singh said.  Some countries such as Germany have come out with bids for importing green hydrogen.   I have asked the domestic industry to analyse the bids and figure out whether they can also participate in the bidding,  he added.  The minister was of the view that battery is not suited for long-range vehicles, which should be powered by green hydrogen.  Singh also highlighted the government's goal of making sectors such as steel, shipping, refining, cement, fertiliser, mobility (long-haul vehicles) and refining (petroleum) based on green hydrogen and ammonia.  The minister also referred to hydrogen purchase obligation (HPO) under which certain industries like refining and fertiliser were to use certain proportion of green hydrogen out of their overall consumption of fossil fuel-based 'grey' hydrogen.  The government has also envisaged to reduce the price of green hydrogen, which is around Rs 300 per kg at present.  Industries across the globe are contemplating to reduce the price of green hydrogen to USD 1 per kg (about Rs 82).  Carbon-free hydrogen, which can be used as fuel in automobiles and as an energy source in industries such as oil refineries and steel plants, is produced by splitting water. When electricity generated from renewable sources such as the sun is used to split water through electrolysis, green hydrogen is produced. Oxygen is a by-product of such a process.",

The project is a joint effort of NTPC and Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL). The first molecule of green hydrogen from the project was set in motion by P Ram Prasad, Head of Project, Kawas, in presence of other senior executives of NTPC Kawas and GGL,  a company statement said. The green hydrogen blending has been started in the piped natural gas (PNG) network of NTPC Kawas township in Surat, it added. After the start of the blending operation, NTPC Kawas held awareness workshops for township residents with the help of GGL officials. NTPC and GGL have worked relentlessly towards achieving this milestone in record time after the foundation stone laying by the Prime Minister on July 30, 2022. This set-up is geared up to supply H2- NG (natural gas) to households of Kawas township at Adityanagar, Surat. Green hydrogen in Kawas is made by electrolysis of water using power from an already installed 1 MW floating solar project. Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), the regulatory body, has approved 5 per cent vol/vol blending of green hydrogen with PNG to start with, and the blending level would be scaled phase-wise to reach 20 per cent. Green hydrogen when blended with natural gas reduces CO2 emissions keeping the net heating content the same. It stated that this feat is achieved only by a few select countries like the UK, Germany and Australia etc. This would bring India to the centre stage of the global hydrogen economy. India would not only reduce its hydrocarbon import bill significantly but can also bring forex ashore by being a green hydrogen and green chemicals exporter to the world, it stated.",

        "articleBody": "India is planning a $2 billion incentive programme for the green hydrogen industry, three sources told Reuters, in a bid to cut emissions and become a major export player in the field. The 180-billion-rupee ($2.2 billion) incentive aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen by a fifth over the next five years, said a senior government official and an industry manager working in renewable energy. It would do this in part by increasing the scale of the industry, they said. The current cost in India is 300 rupees to 400 rupees per kg, said the manager. The United States and the European Union have already approved incentives worth billions of dollars for green hydrogen projects. Hydrogen can be used as a fuel. It is made by splitting water with an electrical process, electrolysis. If the devices that do that, electrolysers, are powered by renewable energy, the product is called green hydrogen, a fuel free of greenhouse emissions. The Indian aid could be announced in the Feb. 1 budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1, said the government official. All sources declined to be named discussing a budget proposal. The ministries of renewable energy and finance did not respond to queries sent by Reuters. Indian companies such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, Adani Enterprises , JSW Energy and Acme Solar have big plans on green hydrogen. Adani, led by the world's third-richest person, Gautam Adani, said in June that it and France's TotalEnergies would jointly create the  world's largest green hydrogen ecosystem . Green ammonia, too The Indian government expects industry to invest 8 trillion rupees in green hydrogen and its derivative green ammonia by 2030, said the industry manager and another government official. Green ammonia is made by combining nitrogen with hydrogen using renewable energy sources; it can be used by the fertiliser industry or as a fuel or convenient means of transporting hydrogen. The green hydrogen proposal is likely to be called  Strategic Intervention for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT)  and will be split into 45 billion rupees for electrolyser manufacturing for five years and the 135 billion rupees for green hydrogen and green ammonia production for three years, the manager and second official said. The incentive for making green hydrogen is likely to be 50 rupees per kg for three years, they said. India aims to sell 70% of the production to countries such as South Korea, Japan and in the European Union, an industry official said, adding that derivatives, including green ammonia, had an equally strong demand. The government is estimating global demand for green hydrogen will exceed 100 million tonnes by 2030, from just under 75 million tonnes now, according to other industry sources. In February the government announced plans for India to make 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030, a figure that the first government official said could be doubled, depending on international demand. The government also plans for the country to achieve electrolyser manufacturing capacity of 15 gigawatts in phases by 2030. That would be almost 10 times current global capacity. U.S.-based Ohmium International has commissioned India's first green-hydrogen factory in Bengaluru. Reliance Industries , Larsen & Toubro, Greenko and H2e Power last year announced plans to build gigawatt-scale factories. Indian oil refineries and fertiliser and steel plants annually use 5 million tonnes of hydrogen made from natural gas, called grey hydrogen. The process produces carbon dioxide. Higher gas prices have pushed the Indian grey hydrogen price to around 200 rupees per kg from 130 rupees a year ago.",

The lithium ion batteries, currently being used in India and elsewhere, are equally clean fuel options.However, the fast depleting resources of lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper, and the fact that they are not available in abundance in the country leaves India highly dependent on imports, much like its dependence on fossil fuel imports to meet its power demand.Compared to lithium ions, sodium is more abundantly available in nature, its batteries are low cost and its charging time is less compared to lithium ion batteries. Further, it can be transported at zero volt compared to lithium ion batteries, which need to remain charged at all times, thus reducing the chances of explosions.In the private sector, Reliance Industries had earlier this year bought UK-based Faradion. The company plans to build four gigafactories to drive its clean energy mission over the next few years.Scientists at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur have developed sodium-ion batteries and supercapacitors that can be integrated into e-cycles for rapid charging.",

        "articleBody": "India's largest power producer NTPC Ltd aims to sell a 20% stake in its green energy business this fiscal year, expecting to raise up to 30 billion Indian rupees ($363.97 million), three government sources said.  The deal marks the first green transaction by an Indian state company, which has drawn interest from investors, such as Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Malaysia's Petronas and Brookfield.  The decision to sell 20% to strategic investors will be followed by an initial public offering of NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) next financial year, two of the sources, senior government officials with direct knowledge of the matter, said.  India's renewables sector is among the country's top five industries attracting the highest levels of foreign investment this year. Its percentage share of total foreign direct investment inflows has risen to 5% in April-September 2022 against 3.3% in the same period last year, data from India's commerce ministry showed.  NTPC was initially planning to raise funds through a public share sale. The company is now looking at first selling a 20% stake through a private placement as this would provide a valuation for an IPO, the third source said. The size of the stake sale and the deal value has not been previously reported.  NTPC did not respond to requests for comment.  INVESTMENTS NTPC plans an investment of more than 2.5 trillion rupees in the next 10 years to raise the share of non-fossil energy its portfolio to 45% from the present 9.41%. Its remaining capacity is coal-fired.  It is open to selling a total 49% stake in its green energy unit in tranches, the sources said.  The proposal has been moved by the ministry of power for consideration by the federal cabinet. The stake sale is targeted for this financial year,  one of the sources said. India's financial year starts on April 1 and runs through to March. To test investor appetite for a share placement, NTPC in September floated an Expression of Interest to sell minority stake in NGEL. It received 13 bids from investors also including ArcelorMittal, India's NIIF and Abu Dhabi-listed TAQA.  NTPC Green Energy will be the driver for the parent company's non-fossil businesses. The company has committed to adding 60 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2032 on a total group capacity of 130 gigawatts.  On Tuesday, the company said it passed 1 gigawatts annual capacity in the renewable energy segment. NTPC has said it will not set up new coal-based projects but is considering a few expansion projects at its existing pit-head plants. NTPC's total capacity is 70.7 gigawatts. India which has set a goal to become net zero by 2070, has committed to achieve 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.  The country targets 500 gigawatts of renewable energy generation by 2030. Renewable energy sources including wind, hydro and biomass constitute 30% of the country's present installed capacity of 409 gigawatts.",

        "articleBody": "France and Portugal agreed Friday to build by 2030 a major undersea pipeline to transport hydrogen from the Iberian Peninsula to France and eventually the rest of Europe. The pipeline is aimed at making the European Union's energy supply more independent, a goal expedited by the Russian invasion of Ukraine last February that precipitated an energy crisis. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the pipeline, dubbed H2Med, will be able to convey some 2 million metric tons of hydrogen to France annually - 10% of the EU's estimated hydrogen needs. The project is expected to cost 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion). The announcement came after a meeting between Sanchez, his French and Portuguese counterparts and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the eastern Spanish city of Alicante.  Today, the Iberian Peninsula is becoming a major European energy gateway to the world,  Von der Leyen said at a joint press briefing. French President Emmanuel Macron said H2Med, which replaces an earlier proposal to transport gas across the Pyrenees Mountains, will  take a new path through the Mediterranean and rely on a technology of the future, which is hydrogen.   It will also probably allow later other European interconnections toward some other countries which will want to get that hydrogen,  he added. Portugal, Spain and France struck a broad deal on the plan in October. They hope to present it to the European Commission by Dec. 15 so it will be eligible for EU financing, which could represent as much as 50% of the cost. The project will first connect two plants in northern Portugal and northern Spain and then involve a pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from the northeastern Spanish port of Barcelona to France's Marseille.  We are strengthening European Union's strategic autonomy and energy security at a moment when solidarity among Europeans is essential to reduce energy dependency on countries that use energy as a blackmailing tool,  Sanchez said, in reference to Russia and the gas crisis that has emerged since the war in Ukraine. He said that with the project, they  aspire to be a benchmark not only in Europe, but also worldwide, in the field of hydrogen.  Spain and Portugal had initially wanted to pipe gas across land to France but Paris rejected that proposal.  Hydrogen is a game-changer for Europe,  said Von der Leyen. She said the EU planned to produce 10 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and to import another 10 million tons.",

        "articleBody": "Hyderabad-based Greenko Group has emerged as the lowest bidder in the world\u2019s first and largest technology agnostic storage tender from NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NTPC REL), the renewable arm of NTPC Limited. Greenko is backed by GIC Holdings Pte Ltd, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Japan\u2019s ORIX Corp. Greenko was the lowest bidder for 3,000 megawatt hours (MWh) tender, competing with Italy\u2019s Enel Group Indian arm Enel Green Power (EGP), JSW Neo Energy Ltd, Hinduja Renewables Energy Private Ltd, HES Infra Pvt Ltd, and India Grid Trust (IndiGrid). Greenko\u2019s lowest bid was for Rs 5 per kWh on a single cycle per day basis, with effective storage charges to be far lower than Rs 2.5 per kWh.Bid values were as high as 216%, made by Hinduja Renewables Energy Pvt Ltd and as low as 0% and 12.50% made by Greenko Group.The tender saw participation from multiple technologies like Li-Ion Battery, Na-S Battery, PumpedStorage Project and Compressed Air Storage technology for supply of 500 megawatt for six hours for a 25 year period. NTPC plans to supply round the clock electricity to the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment.Open access allows large users of electricity to buy power from the open market, against relying on a more expensive grid.In a statement, the company said it is developing the energy storage platform based on pumped storage technology (PSP) and has projects totalling 50 GigaWatt hour storage capacity alreadyunder development. This storage tender establishes a model for procurement of long duration energy storage capacity by RE Generators and utilities for creating decarbonized power supply solutions,  said Greenko Group in a press statement, adding that the tender establishes pumped storage technology as the preferred and lowest cost long duration energy storage solution.With India\u2019s largest operational clean energy portfolio of 7.5 gigawatt (GW), Greenko is building 50 gigawatt hour (GWh) of storage capacity on pumped storage technology (PSP), as part of its plan to set up an energy storage cloud platform of 100 GWh. National Investment and Infrastructure Fund\u2019s (NIIF) Ayana Renewable Power Pvt. Ltd. has also partnered with Greenko Group to store 6-GWh of power in hydro pump storage plants that Greenko is building at Pinnapuram in Andhra Pradesh.The company said this winning bid is remarkable in view of the storage charges discovered in another recent energy storage procurement tender based on battery energy storage systems by SECI ($/MWh 120).Taking in account the fact that PSP can deliver more than one cycle per day without any impact on theperformance, effective storage charges can be significantly lower ($/MWh 29), it said. The storage solution provided by Greenko is also unique as it has minimal/ no long-term environmental impact over the entire life cycle and Scope 2/3 emissions are fully quantifiable as compared to other competing energy storage technologies,  the company said.Energy storage is expected to play an important role in India's commitment to meet its net-zero emission targets by 2070 as India plans to store cheap green power during off-peak hours in pump storage projects and release it for consumption when the electricity demand increases.Greenko has been on an expansion spree wherein it partnered with Singapore-based Keppel Infrastructure Holdings Pte Ltd (Keppel Infrastructure) to jointly produce at least 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year. In September Korean steelmaker Posco Holdings partnered with Greenko subsidiary ZeroC for producing Green Hydrogen, Ammonia and related derivatives in India for both the domestic and export markets.The company also partnered with state-run ONGC to develop green ammonia production and storage facilities for export purposes. The facility will have a capacity to produce one million tonne per annum of green ammonia through a 1.3 gigawatts (GW) green hydrogen plant.",

        "articleBody": "A bill that seeks to promote the use of non-fossil fuels, including ethanol, green hydrogen and biomass, was introduced in Rajya Sabha for passage on Thursday. The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill, 2022, is also aimed at helping the country achieve its international commitments on climate change. The legislation was cleared by Lok Sabha in August this year. Piloting the bill in the Upper House, Power Minister R K Singh said the country is working towards reduction in emissions although its per capita emissions is about one third of the global average.  If we look at the total carbon dioxide load on the environment, our contribution is just 3.4 per cent even as our population is 17.5 per cent of the global population,  he said. Yet, the county has emerged as one of the leading nations in energy transition and climate action, he added.  Today our non-fossil fuel power generation capacity is 42 per cent of our total capacity which is around 408 giga watt,  he said, adding that this initiative needs to be carried forward.  We have changed the way of generating electricity but that accounts for 40 per cent of the emissions. But we have to address other sectors which account for 60 per cent of emissions, which includes steel and cement manufacturing,  Singh said. In order to remain a leader in climate action, the government has brought in amendments in the legislation, he added.  In petroleum refining, we use hydrogen drawn from natural gas. The idea is to make green hydrogen here and thereafter replace the imported natural gas and stop carbon emission,  Singh said. Similarly, in the production of fertilisers, ammonia is used from natural gas, he said.  Now we propose to replace it with green ammonia. That is why we are bringing the amendments so that we make changes in the feedstock,  Singh said. The government also aims to address the construction sector through legislation, he added. The amendments also seek to promote renewable energy and the development of a domestic carbon market to battle climate change. Further, the bill seeks to introduce new concepts such as carbon trading and mandate the use of non-fossil sources to ensure faster decarbonisation of the Indian economy and help achieve sustainable development goals in line with the Paris Agreement. The bill also provides for penalties for violations by industrial units or vessels as well as on manufacturers if a vehicle fails to comply with fuel consumption norms.",

        "articleBody": "Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is in advanced talks with Hinduja-owned truck and bus maker Ashok Leyland for the development and supply chain of hydrogen-powered engines, said two people aware of the development.As a first step under the plan, Leyland will retrofit an existing fleet of 45,000 trucks, which RIL has contracted to ferry refined products and other marketing goods, with fuel-cell engines so that these vehicles can use green hydrogen instead of diesel, the people said.Reliance is planning to produce green hydrogen at its Jamnagar refinery facility from 2025. As technology evolves, it is looking to expand the supply of hydrogen to the larger automotive market, including for buses and cabs. Partnership Details Being Finalised  This could mean similar tie-ups with other automakers, or widen the scope of engagement with Leyland, said one of the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity as the business plans are still in private domain.It is not clear as yet if RIL would, in future, tie up with cab aggregators like Ola or Uber.Details of the structure of the partnership, potential equity contribution and capex are being finalised between RIL and Leyland, the people said.RIL and Ashok Leyland did not respond till press time Wednesday to queries emailed by ET on Monday evening. RIL has reached out to Ashok Leyland for the development of these engines. The plan is to use these engines for the fleet of trucks RIL uses and, of course, going forward expand this to the larger automotive market,  said one of the people.  Currently the plan envisages retrofitting the engines of these Ashok Leyland fleet of trucks before moving on to the fleet of other service providers. These retro-fittings would take place across Ashok Leyland's truck workshops in the country. RIL already has a working relationship with Leyland wherein the truck maker trains drivers for RIL's supply chain segment. RIL has three driver training schools in Gujarat. Leyland is RIL's key vendor when it comes to truck supplies.A year ago, Nitin Seth, a former chief operating officer at Ashok Leyland, took over as the chief executive - new mobility at RIL.Seth was among the key architects in forming the electric vehicle arm, Switch Mobility, at the country's second-largest truck maker. He has more than three decades of experience in the automotive space.Sources said, as India is prioritising green hydrogen as a potential solution to decarbonise industries and transportation, RIL wants to take the first mover advantage in the transport segment. Also, since the company would be a key producer of green hydrogen going forward, it is interested in establishing an ecosystem for the fuel, generating a critical mass.Green hydrogen is the cleanest form of fuel when produced through renewable sources of energy. This August, at RIL's AGM, Ambani had unveiled his plan to shift to green hydrogen with an aim to start the transition by 2025.  Reliance is not new to hydrogen. We are one of the largest producers of grey hydrogen globally... We aim to progressively commence transition from grey hydrogen to green hydrogen by 2025, after proving our cost and performance targets,  Ambani had said. ",

        "articleBody": "Global renewable power capacity is set to double over the next five years, driven by energy security concerns in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. In an annual report on the outlook for renewables, the IEA said capacity worldwide is expected to grow by 2,400 gigawatts (GW) - equal to the entire power capacity of China today - to 5,640 GW by 2027. The increase is 30% higher than the amount of growth forecast a year ago. High gas and power prices from a global energy crisis this year have made renewable power technologies more attractive. Growth in renewables is also being driven by the United States, China and India implementing policies and market reforms to support renewables deployment more quickly than previously planned.  Renewables were already expanding quickly, but the global energy crisis has kicked them into an extraordinary new phase of even faster growth as countries seek to capitalise on their energy security benefits,  said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.  The world is set to add as much renewable power in the next five years as it did in the previous 20 years,  he added. The report said renewables are set to account for over 90% of global electricity expansion over the next five years, overtaking coal to become the largest source of global electricity by early 2025. Global solar photovoltaic capacity is set to almost triple by 2027, becoming the largest source of power capacity in the world, while wind capacity is set to almost double. Meanwhile biofuels demand is set to increase by 22% by 2027, the report said. ",

        "articleBody": "Russian nuclear major Rosatom's nuclear fuel arm TVEL\u2019s Senior Vice-President for Research and Development Alexander Ugryumov has presented the new Russian technologies and solutions for nuclear fuel cycle at a recent conference Characterization and quality control of nuclear fuels in Hyderabad.The presentation covered the key developments which may enhance efficiency of the functioning units of the Kudankulam NPP, powered by VVER-1000 reactors, as well as the ones under construction. In particular, it embraced new materials and models of nuclear fuel, solutions for higher uranium enrichment, technologies of closed nuclear fuel cycle and the new prospects they open for NPPs.Longer fuel cyclesIn 2022, TVEL started exports of the more advanced TVS-2M fuel to India, instead of the UTVS model, previously supplied to Kudankulam. Introduction of the new fuel enables elongation of the reactors operation between refuelings form 12 to 18 months, which would essentially enhance the power plants performance and economic efficiency (besides, TVS-2M model is more reliable). However, the new Rosatom\u2019s developments have a potential to make the further operations of the power plant, lasting for decades, even more efficient.Alexander Ugryumov stressed, that introduction of nuclear fuel with enrichment over the 5% level will enable operations of VVER-1000 reactors in longer 24 months fuel cycles. Extending the fuel cycle means that a power plant may stop reactors for refueling less frequently (and thus, generate more electricity per year), purchase fewer fresh fuel assemblies, and also offload less irradiated fuel bundles (handling of spent fuel also requires expenses). Using fuel with uranium enrichment over 5% may decrease the amount of annually replaced fuel bundles by the rate which would provide a significant economic impact on the power units lifecycle.ATFA key trend of the recent years is the development of ATF (Advanced Technology Fuel), a new generation fuel in terms of safety. Rosatom is also accomplishing the Russian ATF program, which includes development and testing new fuel materials, both of cladding and fuel matrix.In a VVER-1000 reactor at the Rostov NPP, lead test rod program is under way. Several fuel assemblies containing ATF fuel rods with innovative claddings made of chromium-nickel alloy, as well as zirconium alloy with chromium coating, undergo irradiation. Along with that, in the MIR research reactor at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, experimental fuel rods with four different combinations of fuel composition and cladding materials undergo the fourth cycle of testing. In addition, testing of VVER and PWR fuel rods with new uranium-silicide fuel has begun in 2022, also in the MIR reactor.Balanced fuel cycleA feature of the Russian approach is development of the dual-component nuclear power industry with thermal and fast neutron reactors, as well as the introduction of closed nuclear fuel cycle technologies, which are based on fabrication of fresh uranium-plutonium fuel from reprocessed irradiated fuel.The technologies of fast reactors and nuclear recycling enable Rosatom to offer to its foreign customers a new integrated product \u2013 Balanced Nuclear Fuel Cycle. It is aimed at fundamental reduction of both, the volume of nuclear waste sent for disposal, and its radiation activity level. Balanced NFC would improve the safety of waste management and reduce environmental risks without leaving nuclear legacy for the future generations, as well as ensure a sustainable consumption and production model. It will multiply increase the feed-stock base of nuclear energy through involvement of secondary nuclear fuel cycle products, such as depleted uranium and plutonium.Rosatom is ready to provide foreign customers with a full range of solutions, including processing of spent nuclear fuel in Russia (with afterburning of highly active elements extracted from irradiated fuel in fast reactors), as well as manufacturing and supply of uranium-plutonium fuel for common thermal neutrons reactors (in particular, light-water installations, like VVER).5th generation fuelIn order to establish serial batch production of uranium-plutonium fuel for VVER reactors, Rosatom develops the fifth generation model of a fuel assembly - TVS-5. The features of this design would enable to develop a fully automated unmanned fabricaiton of fuel with plutonium and its handling at nuclear power plants. At present, TVEL Fuel Company has completed a set of bench tests of full-scale TVS-5 mock-ups and prepared relevant validations. For 2023, it is planned to manufacture several TVS-5 bundles with standard uranium fuel, the next stage should be pilot operation of the innovative design assemblies at one of Russian nuclear power plants.",

        "articleBody": "At the foothills of the Himalayas, in the city of Dehradun, India\u2019s government is working on a jet fuel it hopes can help clean up the smog hanging over its big cities.There -- on a sprawling 300 acre tea estate where leopards and deer can be spotted -- scientists are working with partners including Boeing Co. to get global approvals for their biofuel, which is made from waste cooking oil and the seeds of plants like pongamia and jatropha that aren\u2019t consumed.The project run by the Indian Institute of Petroleum, a laboratory of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, is India\u2019s attempt at shaking up the $155 billion global biofuels industry, which has long been dogged by criticism that crop-based alternatives like ethanol can trigger indirect emissions by expanding farmland and driving up food prices for the world\u2019s poorest people.The institute has tied up with India\u2019s biggest airline, IndiGo, to deploy its homegrown fuel, however its researchers face a string of challenges. Not only is the new technology for the production of the fuel more expensive than traditional jet fuel, but there are difficulties collecting sufficient raw materials, hampering scientists\u2019 ability to produce it on a wide enough scale to be commercially viable.Building the infrastructure needed to transport and store the sustainable aviation fuel will take \u201csignificant\u201d investments, said Salil Gupte, president of Boeing India.\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s more about first proving that we can do the fuel locally and that\u2019s what we\u2019re engaged on with IIP,\u201d Gupte said. \u201cThe infrastructure to build out the availability of jet aviation fuel has taken decades and decades, so we\u2019re going to have to either modify or build over that system an equally convenient capability for sustainable aviation fuel.\u201dVillagers rummage through jungles of Chhattisgarh and Karnataka to gather seeds of wild jatropha and pongamia trees, which are then crushed in small mills to extract oils that then travel hundreds of miles in trucks to reach the institute in Dehradun and get converted into sustainable aviation fuel.While they work on boosting scale, the Dehradun scientists are also seeking approval for the fuel from ASTM International, the Pennsylvania-based organization that develops and publishes standards for products and services globally. Boeing says it\u2019s presently helping review and support the certification process for the aviation fuel samples from Dehradun. Airbus SE, meanwhile, is studying the demand and challenges of sustainable aviation fuel in India with Paris-based airport operator Groupe ADP among others to prepare a business case for the fuel\u2019s local production.One advantage the fuel would have over other alternatives being used in the US is that it doesn\u2019t have to be blended with regular jet fuel and can potentially be used as is, according to Anil Sinha, senior principal scientist at the institute.\u201cIn the US, we\u2019re still giving an option to food crops, and for that reason, I think India and Europe are ahead of what the US is proposing,\u201d said Nikita Pavlenko, fuels team lead at the Washington-based International Council on Clean Transportation. At the same time, India\u2019s strategy is harder to implement and more expensive, Pavlenko said.Senior officials at the ministries of petroleum and civil aviation didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.To commercialize the indigenous fuel, the center has given its technology to the government-owned Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd., and it plans to develop a plant with a capacity of 20,000 liters a day by 2024. But four years after SpiceJet Ltd. operated India\u2019s first biofuel flight, the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel hasn\u2019t taken off.India also doesn\u2019t have the supply chains needed to gather feedstock in far off places. Anjan Ray, the institute\u2019s director, estimates India has the potential to gather 3.5 million tons of oilseeds, but the actual collection is less than 500,000 tons annually.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed to turning India -- the world\u2019s third largest emitter of green house gases -- net carbon zero by 2070, but his government faces difficulties on several fronts. By 2040, just 59.4% of new car sales in India will be electric vehicles, compared with 84.6% in China and 78.7% in the US, BloombergNEF estimates. India may also miss its target of increasing renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts by the end of 2022 with state power retailers grappling with financial distress.For the indigenous biofuel, much hinges on a push by the government. IndiGo, which has committed to blending 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, said in a statement that the government should give tax benefits and subsidies to encourage its use. India needs to build transportation, storage and airport infrastructure for blending of sustainable aviation fuel, it said.Tapping used cooking oil or biomass waste is a more \u201csustainable route,\u201d said Ramya Natarajan, group head for climate change mitigation at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, a think tank in Bengaluru. \u201cBut the challenge there is the absence of a workable supply chain.\u201d",

This takes CPPIB's stake to 31.5% in the company's voting rights associated with outstanding shares. CPPIB will also have the right of first offer on Goldman's existing shares in ReNew's listed US parent, ReNew Energy Global Plc. Goldman's ownership of all classes of shares in ReNew has come down to around 12%, with a low single-digit voting share, said the people.CPPIB, Goldman Sachs and ReNew Power offered no comments to ET till press time. CPPIB First Invested $392 m in ReNew in '18  CPPIB first invested in ReNew in 2018, after the company aborted its India IPO plans, deploying around $392 million at a 2.2 billion valuation. Being domiciled in India then, the per-share price for the transaction for the private company was Rs 410. 95461953In February this year, Goldman sold 18 million Class A shares and 3.4 million Class C shares of the company at a similar $6.50 each to CPPIB for $139 million. The investment took the Canadian pension fund's voting rights to 26.2% from 20.1% and its economic interest became 14%. CPPIB also agreed to buy an additional 9 million Class C shares from Goldman at the same price for another $58.5 million. This took place shortly after ReNew announced a $250 million share buyback, six months after its listing.",

The owners had claimed that they were harassed by the local state transport officials for not having permit documents despite the central government notification specified that permits are not needed for these vehicles.Sources said the issue was brought to the notice of road transport minister Nitin Gadkari and at a recent meeting with ministry officials, he directed the department to notify the new norm. \u201cThis will be a practical solution to ensure that commercial EV owners or drivers are not subjected to any harassment. They will get the document without any charge. This will work as an official proof and help avoid any confrontation,\u201d TOI quoted an official as saying.The ministry had issued a notification exempting battery operated vehicles and the ones driven on methanol or ethanol from the requirement of permit for carrying passengers or goods on October 18, 2018.Some of the transporters said that the government needs to ensure that all states abide by the rule notified by the Centre.\u201cThe permit for EVs should be issued automatically as and when one registers a commercial vehicle. The government must ensure that none needs to apply for such permits,\u201d said one of the EV bus operators.(With inputs from TOI)",

        "articleBody": "India is in talks with the governments of other countries to export green hydrogen made in the South Asian nation, Reuters quoted an official of its foreign ministry as saying on Thursday.  We are in a position to make green hydrogen as our main source of energy in the future,  Prabhat Kumar, an additional secretary of the external affairs ministry, said at an industry event.Green hydrogen is made by breaking down water using electricity from renewable sources, which is considered crucial to decarbonize hard-to-abate heavy industries.The Indian government is planning a massive expansion of green hydrogen production to curb its dependence on energy imports and to wean the economy off fossil fuels to meet climate targets.New Delhi is aiming for an annual production capacity of 25 million tons by 2047, people familiar with the plans told Bloomberg. However, the number could change going forward, depending on technology and the country\u2019s demand outlook, they said.India\u2019s current output of the fuel is very low and comes from a handful of pilot projects. While green hydrogen is regarded as a potential panacea to cut emissions, there are still major challenges in scaling up the technology and making it cost-effective. It\u2019s not certain demand growth will materialize, and the fuel may not become the first choice in transport and industry.The potential to generate low-cost renewable energy in India, the world\u2019s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, has been a driving force behind the government\u2019s carbon-free hydrogen ambitions. India\u2019s goal of getting to net zero by 2070 has found support from business tycoons, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, as well as state-run energy giants like NTPC Ltd. and Indian Oil Corp. Adani has pledged to spend $70 billion on clean energy assets, including green hydrogen, while Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd., one of India\u2019s most valuable companies, plans to add production of solar panels, electrolyzers for clean hydrogen and rechargeable batteries. French oil giant TotalEnergies SE has agreed to partner with Adani on hydrogen in India. The government is considering more ways to spur the sector, including offering production-linked incentives to make electrolyzers.Green hydrogen is made by splitting hydrogen and oxygen in water with the help of electrolyzers, powered by renewable electricity. The product can replace the use of hydrogen derived from some fossil fuels, in refineries and fertilizer plants. It has the potential to become an alternative to coal in steel mills and oil products in long-haul transport. The green hydrogen targets are part of a broader strategy for 2047, the centenary year of India\u2019s independence. The plan also includes measures to improve energy efficiency, overhaul power markets and expand manufacturing of renewable energy equipment, according to the people. Conglomerates run by India\u2019s two richest men -- Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani -- along with state energy giants have committed large investments in the green hydrogen value chain, responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ambition to make the country a global powerhouse in this area.(With inputs from agencies) ",

KKR will invest $400 million into the platform for an undisclosed equity participation, while Sterlite Group companies will invest $100 million. Serentica Renewables is a wholly owned subsidiary of Twinstar Overseas Limited, which is owned by Volcan Investments Ltd, Bahamas, the holding company of the family trust of Vedanta Group's Anil Agarwal.ET broke the story online before the formal announcement.  95387077Serentica was launched in September with an aim to provide round-the-clock clean energy solutions to the commercial and industrial segment which consumes more than 50% of the electricity generated in India. Serentica aims to provide assured renewable energy through a combination of solar, wind, energy storage and balancing solutions, the company said. Companies including cement, steel and chemicals, aluminium, zinc among others are looking for complete decarbonising solutions and the platform will service them. The initial idea is to supply 100 megawatts of power to these companies. Of the $400 million, $100 million will go towards growth capital and the rest in the project,  Pratik Agarwal, Director, Serentica Renewables told ET on a call.Serentica's plan has been to offer a new model whereby a renewable generation SPV will be formed for each customer. The customer would pick up to 26% in the venture and sign a long-term PPA, thus meeting their demand for green power.  Energy-intensive, heavy-industry companies have traditionally faced more challenges in meeting energy needs sustainably. With Serentica, we look to support them in their decarbonisation objectives,  Hardik Shah, Partner at KKR, said.Currently, Serentica has three long-term PPAs and is in the process of developing 1,500 MW of solar and wind power projects across various states including Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. A large part of this capacity will be used to deliver close to 600MW of round-the-clock clean energy to various entities of the Vedanta Group.",

        "articleBody": "PTC India on Tuesday said it has received overwhelming response from clean energy players to supply 3,500 MW renewable power, higher than the 1,000 MW the company had sought. This is a first-of-its-kind development in the Indian power market wherein a trading licensee intended to purchase renewable power for onward sale through market linked products, it added.   PTC has received an interest of supply of 3500 MW of Renewable Energy (RE) from a total of 14 of the top RE producers against its Expression of Interest for procurement of 1000 MW for onward sale through market linked RE products,  a company statement said.  This model will lead to significant changes in the present electricity market structure and speed up the renewable energy generation, it added.  Most of the big domestic private players, including Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd (TPREL), Torrent Power and ReNew Power, participated in the process.  Besides, many internationally renowned companies like Enel Green and Engie Power have also shown interest.  Developers have offered quantum ranging from 100 MW to 500 MW. Since this is a hybrid based procurement (solar + wind energy) many developers have also offered high capacity utilisation factor (CUF), which means more renewable energy available for sale in the market.  The projects are mainly located in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.  Developers have offered to commission the projects with in a period of 18-24 months.  The offers received from the developers are currently under evaluation and PTC is likely to take a call on the procurement in 3-4 weeks.  Rajib K Mishra, CMD (additional charge), PTC India, said,  This is unique market linked product being initiated by PTC to encourage renewable energy sale in the exchanges or through any other options without putting any burden or commitment on the state Discoms. This will shape-up the future of renewable energy market and will contribute for the growth of the sector. ",

        "articleBody": "Global investment firm KKR, has joined forces with Vedanta Group\u2019s newly formed arm Serentica Renewables to create a new energy platform that aims to help large industrial clients decarbonise, both sides said in a statement on Tuesday.KKR will invest $400 million in the platform for an undisclosed equity participation while Sterlite Group companies will invest $100 million.Serentica Renewables is a wholly subsidiary of Twinstar Overseas Limited which is owned by Volcan Investments Ltd, Bahamas, the holding company of the family trust of Vedanta Group\u2019s Anil Agarwal.Serentica was launched in September with an aim to deliver round-the-clock clean energy solutions for large-scale, energy-intensive industrial customers.ET broke the story online before the formal announcement.Serentica plans to provide round-the-clock clean energy solutions to the commercial and industrial segment which consumes more than 50% of the electricity generated in India. Serentica aims to provide assured renewable energy through a combination of solar, wind, energy storage and balancing solutions, the company said.\u201cCompanies including cement, steel and chemicals, aluminium, zinc among others are looking for complete decarbonising solutions and the platform will service them. The initial idea is to supply 100 megawatts of power to these companies. Of the $400 million, $100 million will go towards growth capital and the rest in the project,\u201d Pratik Agarwal, Director, Serentica Renewables told ET on a call.Serentica's plan has been to offer a new model for meeting the green power needs of commercial and industrial players whereby a renewable generation special purpose vehicle (SPV) will be formed for each customer. The customer would pick up to 26% in the venture and sign a long-term PPA, thus meeting their demand for green power.\u201cEnergy-intensive, heavy-industry companies play an important role in society but have traditionally faced more challenges in meeting energy needs sustainably. With Serentica, we look to support these companies in their decarbonization objectives,\u201d Hardik Shah, Partner at KKR, said.Currently, Serentica has three long-term power purchase agreements and is in the process of developing 1,500 MW of solar and wind power projects across various states including Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. A large part of this capacity will be used to deliver close to 600MW of round-the-clock clean energy to various entities of the Vedanta Group.Vedanta Ltd is scaling up its renewable energy sourcing to 1 GW. The group is currently building over 1,000-megawatt wind/solar hybrid projects in Karnataka to power smelters in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Odisha through the inter-state transmission network. Over the next five years it plans to increase the renewable capacity by 10-fold and invest close to Rs 50,000 crore into renewable generation, Agarwal had said last week at the Global Investors\u2019 Meet in Karnataka.The company\u2019s medium-term goal is to install 5,000 MW of carbon-free generation capacity coupled with different storage technologies and supply over 16 billion units of clean energy annually and displace 20 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.Standard Chartered Bank was the advisor.The transaction in Serentica marks KKR\u2019s latest investment in India and the renewables sector. Since 2011, KKR has deployed over $15 billion in equity globally to invest in renewable assets, such as solar and wind, which have an operational power generation capacity of 23 GW, as of December 31, 2021.India is the third-largest emitter of GHG (greenhouse gas) after China and the US The bulk of these emissions (70%) are driven by five sectors\u2013 power, steel, automotive, cement and agriculture. The country has committed to achieving about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based resources by 2030 and as it races to achieve the same, investments in the green energy segment, particularly, manufacturing and supply of green ammonia and green hydrogen, are rising.Hydrogen is a versatile energy source and chemical reductant. According to Mckinsey & Company, adoption of green hydrogen could enable an annual abatement of 900 MtCO2e (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) for India by 2050 and result in substantial forex savings. Industrial users and clean tech companies are evaluating how hydrogen can be made from clean sources like wind and solar to replace fossil fuel usage. Citing the enormous opportunity in the segment, companies are setting up capacities in manufacturing green ammonia and green hydrogen.For instance, the steel industry, using green hydrogen, could save a cumulative forex of $280 billion on coking coal imports by 2050. Early adoption of hydrogen can also enable forex savings of $420 billion on oil & gas imports for the country. Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries and Adani Group's Adani Petrochemicals have also announced plans to manufacture and supply green hydrogen for domestic as well as export market. While last month Singapore-based Keppel Infrastructure Holdings Pte Ltd (Keppel Infrastructure) tied up with Greenko Group to jointly produce at least 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year, in September, Korean steelmaker Posco Holdings partnered with Greenko subsidiary ZeroC for producing Green Hydrogen, Ammonia and related derivatives in India for both the domestic and export markets.In August, energy frim Avaada Group signed a deal with the Government of Rajasthan to set up a green ammonia facility with a production capacity of one million tonnes per annum and in July, state-run ONGC tied up with Greenko to develop green ammonia production and storage facility for export purpose. The facility will have a capacity to produce one million tonne per annum of green ammonia through a 1.3 gigawatts (GW) green hydrogen plant.Additionally, ReNew Power signed an agreement with the Egyptian government to invest $8 billion to produce green hydrogen in the African country. Backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, will be looking to produce 2,20,000 tons of the clean fuel annually in Egypt in the coming years. It has also tied up with Indian Oil Corporation and EPC major L&T to supply green hydrogen at an industrial scale. ",

The programme will aid the use of huge surplus biomass, cattle dung, and industrial and urban biowaste available in the country for energy recovery. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has notified the National Bioenergy Programme on November 2, 2022,  an MNRE statement said.The MNRE has continued the National Bioenergy Programme for 2021-22 to 2025-26. The programme was recommended for implementation in two Phases.Phase-I has been approved with a budget outlay of Rs 858 crore, it stated.The National Bioenergy Programme will include the three Sub-schemes: Waste to Energy Programme, Biomass Programme and Biogas Programme.The Waste to Energy Programme (Programme on Energy from Urban, Industrial and Agricultural Wastes /Residues) will support the setting up of large Biogas, BioCNG and Power plants (excluding MSW (municipal solid waste) to power projects).Biomass Programme (Scheme to Support Manufacturing of Briquettes & Pellets and Promotion of Biomass (non-bagasse) based cogeneration in Industries) will support the setting up of pellets and briquettes for use in power generation and non-bagasse-based power generation projects.The biogas programme will also support the setting up of family and medium size Biogas in rural areas.The MNRE has been promoting bioenergy in India since the 1980s to utilise huge surplus biomass, cattle dung, and industrial and urban biowaste available in the country for the recovery of energy.One major support extended by the MNRE has been central financial assistance provided for setting up Bioenergy projects, such as Biogas, BioCNG, and power from urban, Industrial and Agricultural Waste / Residues for reducing their capital cost/ interest on loans, therefore, increasing project viability. The Waste to Energy programme under the umbrella scheme of the National Bioenergy Programme is a welcome step. The well-thought-out scheme shall help in creating the whole investor-friendly ecosystem based on a circular economy, where biogas plays the central role in impacting the environment, job creation, reduction in crude oil imports, promoting organic cropping, and even energy independence in a positive manner,  Gaurav Kedia, Chairman, Indian Biogas Association told PTI.The extra push in the form of a 20 per cent higher standard CFA (central financial assistance) pattern for the northeastern region and Gaushala/shelter was the need of the time to create inclusiveness in an applied manner.

        "articleBody": "The government on Wednesday hiked the price of ethanol used for blending in petrol as it looked to raise the doping quantity to cut India's reliance on imported oil.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane juice to Rs 65.60 per litre from Rs 63.45 per litre for the supply year beginning in December 2022.  The rate for ethanol from C-heavy molasses has been increased to Rs 49.40 per litre from Rs 46.66 per litre currently, and that of ethanol from B-heavy to Rs 60.73 per litre from Rs 59.08 per litre, sources said.At present, 10 per cent ethanol is blended in petrol (10 per cent ethanol, 90 per cent petrol) and the government is looking to double this quantity by 2024-25. We have saved about Rs 40,000 crore in forex outgo from 10 per cent blending besides benefiting the farmers,  he said, adding a pilot to start E-20 (petrol with 20 per cent ethanol) will start from April 2023 at select petrol pumps.The use of ethanol, extracted from sugarcane as well as broken rice and other agri produce, will help the world's third-largest oil consumer and importing country cut its reliance on overseas shipments. India currently is 85 per cent dependent on imports for meeting its oil needs.As much as 452 crore litre of ethanol was blended in petrol during the supply year ending November 30, 2022. For the next year, 540 crore litres procurement is being targeted with an eye to start larger volumes of blending.The government expects 12 per cent ethanol blending in petrol in 2023 at most places.Puri said from 2023, the supply year will change from November to October instead of the present practice of considering the ethanol supply year from December to November.This is to avoid sugar mills from holding ethanol stocks in anticipation of price revision.So, the 540 crore litres of ethanol procurement is the target for 11 months (December 2022 to October 2023), he said. As we reach the 20 per cent target, we can look at raising the percentage of the blend,  he said.Automobile engines can run on E-20 (petrol doped with 20 per cent ethanol) with minor modifications in the engine for corrosion etc.The government has notified the administered price of ethanol since 2014. For the first time in 2018, the differential price of ethanol based on feedstock utilized for ethanol production was announced by the Government.These decisions have significantly improved the supply of ethanol, consequently, ethanol procurement by public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) has increased from 38 crore litre in Ethanol Supply Year 2013-14 (ESY defined as ethanol supply period from December 1 of a year to November 30 of the following year) to contracts of over 452 crore litre in ongoing ESY 2021-22.The target of achieving an average of 10 per cent blending has been achieved in June 2022, much ahead of the target date of November 2022, he said. Government has advanced the target of 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol from earlier 2030 to ESY 2025-26,  he said adding this programme gives sugarcane farmers an additional source of income.",

Given hydropower's importance to India's grid, we are keen on developing stressed hydropower projects in India, including the Mandakini project. Statkraft's plan is pending approval from NCLT,  Statkraft said in response to queries from ET seeking comment about its interest in the Lanco unit.The Norway government-owned company did not disclose the financial details of its resolution offer.This is Statkraft's second offer to the creditors of the Lanco unit, according to sources. Its first offer was rejected because it was conditional and was found to be too low. Sources placed the value of the first offer at below \u20b9130 crore. Its current offer is said to be four times higher.An Axis Bank-led group of creditors is trying to recover loans of \u20b91,300 crore that they had disbursed to Lanco Mandakini Hydro Energy. They have unanimously approved Statkraft's debt resolution plan.The Lanco unit owns an unfinished hydropower plant near the pilgrim town of Kedarnath in Uttarakhand. The plant was partially destroyed by flash floods in 2013. The unit subsequently defaulted on bank loans.Statkraft entered the Indian power market through its subsidiary SN Power in 2004 when it acquired 49% of the shares in Malana Power Company (MPCL). Statkraft was then the first foreign investor in the Indian hydropower sector.Its energy generation portfolio in India includes two operating hydropower assets, one hydropower asset under construction and one solar power project also under construction. All three hydro assets are in Himachal Pradesh. The solar project is in Tamil Nadu. It is also involved in energy trading.mGlobally, Statkraft operates in 17 countries.

        "articleBody": "Apple Inc said on Tuesday it would make fresh investments to set up solar and wind projects in Europe and called on its suppliers to decarbonize operations related to the production of iPhones and other products. The company in 2020 had pledged to remove carbon emissions from its entire business, including products and its sprawling supply chain - which spans from Vietnam to Brazil - by 2030. The iPhone maker will now require its supply partners to report on progress on carbon neutrality goals, specifically Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions, related to the production of Apple products and will audit their progress annually. More than 200 suppliers, representing 70% of Apple's direct manufacturing spending and including Corning Inc, Nitto Denko Corp, SK Hynix Inc, STMicroelectronics, TSMC and Yuto, have committed to using clean power such as wind or solar for all Apple production, Apple said. Apple had previously asked suppliers to commit to 100% renewable energy for Apple's production.  We're determined to be a ripple in the pond that creates a bigger change,  Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. Apple has been carbon neutral for its global corporate operations since 2020. Many multinational companies are increasingly looking into global supply chains to reduce their carbon footprint as climate change becomes a bigger focus for investors and regulators. Apple said the European investments are part of a strategy to address about 22% of its carbon footprint coming from the electricity customers use to charge their devices. With the construction of new projects in Europe, the company is aiming to power all Apple devices on the continent with low-carbon electricity, it said. In total, the planned investments will add 3,000 gigawatt hours per year of new renewable energy on the grid, Apple said.",

        "articleBody": "Singapore-based Keppel Infrastructure Holdings Pte Ltd (Keppel Infrastructure) has tied up with Greenko Group (Greenko), to jointly explore green ammonia and renewable energy opportunities to meet the growing demand for low carbon energy in India, Singapore, and globally.The MoU will explore the feasibility of jointly developing a production facility which can produce at least 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year, the companies said today. Keppel Infrastructure (KI) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Keppel Corporation, a Singapore flagship multinational company providing solutions for sustainable urbanisation. In addition, the companies will jointly identify and evaluate a portfolio of solar and wind energy projects, up to an installed capacity of approximately 1.3 GW, with an investment of $1.5 billion, complemented by pumped hydro-storage, to power the green ammonia production facility. Green ammonia is made with green hydrogen that comes from water electrolysis powered by renewable power.Greenko will produce the green ammonia in India and export the molecules to Singapore. It will use ammonia for industrial use or split it further using its own 6GW turbine to split it further into green hydrogen. The turbine will run on solar and wind power. As more countries journey towards net zero emissions to fight climate change, there is a growing interest internationally to use green ammonia as a direct feedstock for carbon-free energy generation, because when it is used as a fuel, green ammonia does not generate any CO2.Green ammonia can also be used as a hydrogen carrier to provide green hydrogen solutions for hard to abate sectors like chemical and heavy industries.In addition, green ammonia may be used to replace bunker fuels to decarbonise the global maritime industry.The International Energy Agency recognised ammonia \u2013 along with hydrogen \u2013 as an important fuel for future electricity generation.Cindy Lim, CEO of Keppel Infrastructure, said, \u201cThis MOU with Greenko further underlines Keppel\u2019s strategy to be at the forefront of providing innovative, sustainable energy solutions to help the world combat climate change. This is in line with Keppel\u2019s Vision 2030, which places sustainability at the core of the Group\u2019s strategy.\u201d The collaboration between KI and Greenko will also support India\u2019s goal to manufacture five million tonnes of green hydrogen per annum by 2030 and become a production and export hub for the fuel.Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty, CEO and Managing Director at Greenko said, \u201cThe transformation of India from a carbon-based fossil energy importer to an exporter of renewable energy-derived products like green hydrogen, green ammonia, and other green molecules, is the cornerstone of Greenko\u2019 s strategy for future growth. Along with Greenko\u2019s Intelligent Renewable Energy Storage Platform (IRESP) and foray into electrolyser manufacturing, partnerships like these with Keppel are key enabling aspects in an accelerated execution of this vision.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "India will for the first-time export green energy from 2025, with the first shipments going to a Singapore power plant under an MoU signed by an India-based dispatchable renewables company and Singapore's energy business on Tuesday. The MoU to explore opportunities in green hydrogen potential in India will see Greenko group and Singapore's Keppel Infrastructure working towards a 250,000 tonne per annum contract to be supplied to Keppel's new 600Mw power plant in Singapore. Further, the contract for the export of green ammonia would also expand to cover bunker fuel through the Keppel network in Singapore's network of bunker fuel supplies to ships, said Mahesh Kolli, President and Joint Managing Director of Greenko Group. Likewise, Greenko's wide range of investments includes USD 5 billion in the storage of carbon-free green hydrogen energy across India, said Kolli.  India will be exporting energy for the first time from 2025,  said Kolli, after Greenko and Keppel Infrastructure signed the MoU on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week which began on Tuesday. Elaborating, Kolli said Greenko would participate in green hydrogen exports from 2025-26 onwards, estimating global demand of 50 million tonnes a year globally, including 15 million tonnes replacing bunkers fuels in ships. The green ammonia will fuel newly built ships, including a fleet ordered by the international shipping group Maersk.  This is the first time we are making lowest cost carbon-free energy which means this energy is of high quality,  he stressed. Last month, Greenko signed a deal to supply one million tonnes a year of green ammonia supply to South Korean steel and power producer, Posco. The delivery is also expected from 2025-26 onwards. In total, Greenko is planning to produce close to three million tonnes of green ammonia, which will also cover domestic demand, he said. Greenko's green ammonia will help reduce India's imports of about six million tonnes of ammonia and urea, he added. The Greenko-Keppel MoU was virtually witnessed by Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong. Welcoming the MoU, Puri said,  Over the last few years, India has developed unparalleled strength in renewable paths, which acts as a catalyst in producing green hydrogen at competitive prices.  I think the manner in which we have brought down the cost of solar power and I think is something that as appreciation and being applauded, applied throughout the world equally. ",

        "articleBody": "Gautam Adani, Asia\u2019s richest person, is in exploratory talks for a giant renewables project in Morocco, which would aim to supply electricity and emissions-free fuel to Europe.Adani\u2019s coal-to-ports conglomerate is considering building wind and solar generation plants in the North African nation and facilities to produce green hydrogen for export, according to people familiar with the proposals and who requested anonymity to discuss private details. The project, which would be Adani\u2019s largest clean power development outside India, could be as large as 10 gigawatts, according to one of the people. That would be almost equal to Morocco\u2019s existing installed energy generation capacity, which includes a total of about 2.8 gigawatts of wind and solar, according to BloombergNEF data.The development would be delivered in two stages of 5 gigawatts and includes plans to supply power locally and to export some electricity direct to Europe, one of the people said. Under the proposals, Adani is also in talks with Morocco\u2019s state-owned OCP Group for the sale of hydrogen, which the fertilizer maker could use as feedstock to produce carbon-free ammonia, according to a separate person.Adani didn\u2019t respond to an email. Moroccan energy ministry, its fertilizer maker OCP as well as the state renewable energy agency Masen didn\u2019t respond to emailed requests for comment either.It could be years before we see any green hydrogen being exported to Europe, given progress in the technology. A 4GW green-hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia is slated to take four years to finish.Nations in North Africa and parts of the Middle East are increasingly being identified as potential major green hydrogen hubs because of their abundant sunshine and wind, and proximity to key export markets including Europe. In July, India-based ReNew Energy Global signed an initial pact to build an $8 billion green hydrogen project in Egypt. Adani aims to make his empire the world\u2019s largest producer of clean power by the end of the decade, though continues to make major investments in fossil fuels. He\u2019s focusing heavily on development of a green hydrogen sector, and sees the zero emissions fuel as key to enable the decarbonization of heavy industry in India and overseas.Competitors including billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd. and India\u2019s state-run energy giants like NTPC Ltd. and Indian Oil Corp. are also seeking to be among leading champions of the clean fuel.--With assistance from Joe Ryan.",

        "articleBody": "The Indian economy is a  bright star  in an otherwise gloomy situation globally, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said Monday.Addressing a CII event on renewable energy, he also said that efforts should be made to maintain the entire supply chain of this sector in India and not allow a situation like the pharma sector where  our northern neighbour almost took away the entire industry . The minister said that the Covid-19 pandemic has  taught us that we have to be self-sufficient in the sources of renewable energy .Drawing a parallel with the pharma sector, he said:  Key starting materials and API were made in India but some countries particularly our northern neighbour almost took away the entire industry by making ie competitive and giving all sorts of sops, inviting our Indian companies to manufacture in that country and have today become leading suppliers of equipment in the renewable energy space. We should not allow a situation like that to happen in our renewable energy sector and maintain the entire supply chain in India to the best of our ability,  he said.Goyal said that in the past, India has had high imports of both machinery, equipment required for the renewable energy sector and for the traditional power sources, and in products like oil and coking coal which continue to the day. Prices of these products have been prone to the geopolitical uncertainties that the world has faced. We have seen how commodity prices have seen huge swings many times in the past,  he said.Noting that there is a huge opportunity in pushing the growth of the renewable energy industry and become a global supplier, he said that energy security has to be looked as an integral part of national security and in the current context of geopolitics that the world is facing, it is economic security. Because of a geopolitical problem in a third country or when you're not at all a player at all but you land up first suffering as an economy and which in some sense also has ramifications on our national security,  he said, adding that self-sufficiency has a twin advantage- sustainability and economic security.He said India has tremendous potential to make a big difference to herself and the world's future, both on sustainability and self-reliance on energy and the energy security of other countries who  are all now facing severe stress and have over the last two-three years, suffered the consequences of the pandemic and then the war .",

        "articleBody": "From investments in improving operational sustainability through higher efficiency and responsible sourcing of materials to enhancing disclosures, top Indian companies are raising their sustainability quotient, but a lot more effort is needed to meet the net-zero targets set for the country.Several Indian corporate houses have set decarbonisation targets internally to become carbon neutral by 2050 or before. These include Vedanta, Aditya Birla Group, JSW Group, Adani Transmission, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Dalmia Cement, among others. Reliance Industries, the most valuable company in India by market capitalisation, has set a target of net-zero by 2035.Companies have also set internal carbon pricing, which is referred to when making all business decisions. For instance, Vedanta has set a carbon price of \u20b91,125 per ton of CO2 emissions while Mahindra & Mahindra has set it at $10 (Rs 824). 94902370Indian companies have increased investments in areas like renewable power, waste heat recovery systems, more efficient machinery, and renewable fuels to reduce their carbon footprint. For instance, JSW Steel is setting up a 175-megawatt waste heat recovery boiler this year. Meanwhile, Ultratech Cement added 121 megawatt of solar capacity and 42 megawatt of waste heat recovery system in FY22. Tata Steel is looking to have a million tonnes a year of steel recycling capacity through less carbon intensive electric arc furnaces in India by 2025.Companies have also stepped-up scrutiny and handholding of their suppliers to ensure sustainable practices across their value chains, showed sustainability disclosures made by top companies.As many as 100 companies voluntarily disclosed information for FY22 according to the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) standards recommended by Indian markets regulator Sebi. BRSR will become mandatory for top 1,000 Indian companies from FY23. Corporates have made substantial efforts on increased disclosures towards sustainability, capacity building of their teams, defining and quantifying indicators for Environment, Social and Governance aspects, doing business in ESG centric manner and making commitments for net-zero targets,  said Rahul Prithiani, Senior Director - Sustainability, Energy and Commodities, CRISIL.As on date, about 100 Indian companies have committed to Science-Based Target Setting Initiative (SBTi), he said. More than 30 Indian companies have also submitted commitment to SBTi with regards to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.SBTi is a collaborative initiative involving the CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the Worldwide Fund for Nature and it provides target setting methods and guidance to companies on the environment sustainability front.Over Rs 5,400 crore were spent in 2021 by top Indian corporates associated with SBTi to reduce about 5.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, as per a CDP report.The focus is particularly high on cement, iron and steel, refineries, non-ferrous metals and chemicals industries, as these sectors account for almost 70% of India's total industrial emissions, as per a Crisil report.For metals companies, adoption of green hydrogen as a source of energy is the pole star for their net-zero journey. While the technology to produce and consume green hydrogen at scale is still several years away, companies like Tata Steel, JSW, Vedanta and SAIL are already testing the viability of implementing new technologies by entering into technical tie-ups with other players in the industrial value chain.The sustainability efforts of Indian corporations have been spurred in part due to the volume of global capital chasing environmentally responsible investments, experts said. For instance, Tata Motors last year raised $1 billion from TPG Rise Climate, which is a dedicated climate investment fund.Companies are also keen to tap sustainability-linked loans (SLL) to fund their expansion plans to benefit from slightly lower interest rates that this debt comes with. Recently, JSW Cement, Birla Carbon and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals are some of the companies who have raised SLLs in India.However, the pace of fund raising in this space needs to pick up given the sheer volume of capital required for meeting net-zero targets. India would need a total investment of $10.1 trillion (over Rs 830 lakh crore) under net-zero pathway by 2070 as per a CEEW study. This translates to an annual investment of over $200 billion for India. Therefore, actions as well as sustainable finance needs to be significantly accelerated to achieve the net-zero targets,  Prithiani said. As per a Crisil assessment, India would need close to \u20b920 lakh crore of green capital expenditure by 2030.This article is part of a series on sustainability in association with BCG. BCG did not play any role in editorial decision-making.",

India is one of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters and it aims to reach net zero emissions by 2070. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants India to become an industrial powerhouse while also cutting emissions by 60 million tonnes a year by 2030, highlighting the importance of a robust carbon trading market.  A domestic market that is formed in unison and close consultation with relevant industry stakeholders can tremendously accelerate the country's transition to become carbon neutral,  Manish Dabkara, president of the newly formed Carbon Market Association of India, told the media on Tuesday. Dabkara owns EKI Energy Services, which deals in carbon offsetting business. The association includes Hero Future Energies, Ayana Renewable Power and global private equity major KKR's Virescent Infra, among several others. It aims to act as a mediator between government and industry to facilitate trade of carbon credits which would imply increased carbon neutral growth, Dabkara said. The lower house of parliament passed an Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill 2022 in August that seeks to establish carbon trading. Under a carbon trading scheme, government and private entities can earn carbon credits by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. The same credits can be bought and sold in markets.",

        "articleBody": "Adani group-AAI operated Mumbai airport on Monday said it has switched to green energy sources, fulfilling 95 per cent of its requirement from hydro and wind and the rest 5 per cent from solar power. The facility witnessed a rise in natural energy procurement with 57 per cent green consumption in April to a whopping 98 per cent between May to July, and finally attained 100 per cent utilisation of renewable sources of energy in August, the private airport operator said in a statement.  Mumbai Airport was the first in India to launch hybrid technology which has been solely running on green energy since April, thus enabling an efficient and low carbon future for aviation, as part of efforts to reduce carbon footprint, it said.  In April this year, the airport enhanced its capacity usage of green energy and deployed a 10Kwp hybrid solar mill consisting of 2 Kwp turbo mill and 8 Kwp solar PV modules with an estimated minimum solar and wind energy generation of 36 Kwh/day, according to the statement.  This green transition to renewable energy ensures a reduction of around 1.20 lakh tonnes of CO2 equivalent every year, thereby moving closer to the airport's target of becoming net zero by 2029, it stated.  Out of the total 100 per cent, the airport procures around 5 per cent of its electricity requirement through its onsite solar generation and the rest 95 per cent from other green sources such as hydro and wind energy, Mumbai Airport said.  The airport operator set up a 1.06MW rooftop solar power plant, which eventually scaled up to 4.66 MW, it said.",

        "articleBody": "Emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas infrastructure could be stamped out within the next 10 years, industry experts said on Tuesday. Speaking at the Reuters IMPACT climate conference in London, they noted that technology to detect leakages from oil and gas had been ramping up in the last five years, making mitigation feasible.  Those technologies when deployed ... can fix the methane emissions very quickly,  said Julien Perez, vice-president of strategy and policy at the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a consortium of CEOs from a dozen large oil and gas companies. Last year, more than 100 countries pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Methane is about 80% more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide during a 20-year timeframe.  The launch of the Global Methane Pledge will create momentum,  Perez said.  Money will flow.  Currently, oil and gas extraction, processing and distribution is responsible for 23% of global methane emissions, according to a 2021 assessment by the World Meteorological Organization. Landfills account for about 20% of emissions, and roughly one-third come from the agricultural sector. Methane from oil and gas  is one part of (global greenhouse gas emissions) that can be solved this decade,  said Georges Tijbosch, CEO of MIQ, a methane emissions certification standard. Scientists and industry are now using sensors attached to aircraft and satellites to detect methane leaks. This allows oil and gas companies to quickly address the potent plumes, said Deepak Anand, chief revenue officer at GHGSat, a global emissions monitoring company.  Methane is a fuel. It can be captured and used,  he said.  What we try to do is help the oil and gas industry find treasure.  Recently, GHGSat measured the methane leaking from the damaged Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. They found the amount of emissions was equivalent to those from 630,000 pounds of coal burning every hour.  If we're going to maintain gas a transition fuel ... we have to focus on how we can reduce the footprint of gas in the energy system, particularly when it comes to methane,  said Perez.",

        "articleBody": "India's Adani Group will invest more than $100 billion in the next decade, Chairman Gautam Adani, the world's third-richest person, told a Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore. Adani also claimed that India could one day become a net energy exporter, thanks to green hydrogenAs much as 70 per cent of this investment will be in the energy transition space, Adani, the world's third-richest person, said as he continued to reveal bit by bit the group's new energy plans. The ports-to-energy conglomerate will add 45 gigawatts of hybrid renewable power generation capacity and build 3 Giga factories to manufacture solar panels, wind turbines and hydrogen electrolyser.  As a group, we will invest over $100 billion of capital in the next decade,  he said this week.  We have earmarked 70% of this investment for the energy transition space. We are already the world's largest solar player, and we intend to do far more.  The group will be investing over $100 billion in the next decade, 70% for the energy transition. It will also raise the renewable portfolio by another 45 GW of hybrid renewable power generation. Further, the group will invest $70 billion in the integrated green hydrogen-based value chain.Owing to multiple acquisitions and diversification, the group's market cap now stands at 260 billion dollars -- having grown faster than any company ever in India.With interests spanning sea ports, airports, green energy, cement and data centres, the combined market capitalisation of the group's listed companies is USD 260 billion.The group is already the world's largest solar player. In addition to our existing 20 GW renewables portfolio, the new business will be augmented by another 45 GW of hybrid renewable power generation spread over 100,000 hectares of land - an area 1.4 times that of Singapore. This will lead to commercialization of three million metric tonne of green hydrogen,  he said.It will also build 3 Giga factories - one for a 10 GW silicon-based photovoltaic value-chain that will be backward-integrated from raw silicon to solar panels, a 10 GW integrated wind-turbine manufacturing facility, and a 5 GW hydrogen electrolyser factory. Today, we can confidently state that we have a line of sight to first - become one of the least expensive producers of the green electron - and thereafter - the least expensive producer of green hydrogen,  he said.Digital space, he said, seeks to benefit from the energy transition adjacency. The Indian data centre market is witnessing explosive growth. This sector consumes more energy than any other industry in the world and therefore our move to build green data centres is a game-changing differentiator,  he said.The group plans to interconnect data centres through a series of terrestrial and globally linked undersea cables drawn at its ports and build consumer-based super-apps that will bring hundreds of millions of Adani's B2C consumers on one common digital platform. We also just finished building the world's largest sustainability cloud that already has a hundred of our solar and wind sites running on it - all off a single giant command and control centre that will soon be augmented by a global A-I lab,  he said.These new businesses will add to the burgeoning Adani empire which already is the largest airports and sea ports operator in India. It is the nation's highest valued FMCG company, the second-largest cement manufacturer and the largest integrated energy player. The point I would like to make is that - India is full of incredible opportunities. The real India growth story is just starting. This is the best window for companies to embrace India's economic resurgence and the incredible multi-decade tailwind the world's largest and most youthful democracy offers. India's next three decades will be the most defining years for the impact it will have on the world,  he added.Commenting on China, Adani said once the champion of globalization, that country is facing challenges. I anticipate that China - that was seen as the foremost champion of globalization - will feel increasingly isolated. Increasing nationalism, supply chain risk mitigation, and technology restrictions will have an impact,  Adani said.60-year-old Gautam Adani currently heads India's rich list with wealth of Rs 10,94,400 crore, as per the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022. Interestingly, Adani gets the honours for the first time as that spot was occupied by Reliance Industries Ltd's head honcho Mukesh Ambani whose wealth is estimated at Rs 7,94,700 crore.Adani topped the list by adding Rs 1,600 crore per day over the last year.Last year, Ambani was ahead of Adani's wealth by Rs 2 lakh crore. But now, Adani is ahead of Ambani by Rs 3 lakh crore. Adani's wealth has more than doubled (116 per cent) in the last one year and in absolute terms, he added Rs 5,88,500 crore. In the last five year(With inputs from agencies)",

        "articleBody": "Brookfield Asset Management is in active discussions with Greenko to invest at least $1 billion in the company as the Hyderabad-based clean energy firm doubles down on providing energy solutions, said people aware of the matter. The partnership with Brookfield, a long-term owner, operator and developer of infra assets, will help in decarbonising initiatives that both sides have launched. Greenko\u2019s initiatives include pumped hydro storage infrastructure, green hydrogen for industrial usage and ammonia as well as a cloud-based intelligent energy platform.The investment could even go up to $1.25 billion at a potential $9-10 billion valuation and may either be in parent Greenko Energy Holdings (GEH) or subsidiary Greenko Zero C, said the people cited above. That will make Greenko the second-highest valued renewables company after Adani Green Energy Ltd. Greenko Energy Holdings (GEH) has GIC of Singapore as majority shareholder. Orix Corp. of Japan and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are the other shareholders along with the two founders, Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli. In 2020, Orix purchased a 21.8% stake in Greenko for about $961 million at a $6 billion valuation.Greenko Zero C is a step-down subsidiary in which Greenko Energy Holdings has a 70% stake while the two founders own a 30% share. It was set up for various green hydrogen and energy transition initiatives.Earlier this year, Brookfield announced it had raised a record $15 billion for its inaugural Global Transition Fund. This makes it the world's largest private fund dedicated to the net zero transition, signalling that investors are still committed to establishing cleaner portfolios. Brookfield is the single largest sponsor of the fund, having deployed $2 billion. The investment is likely from this fund.        94465311Greenko and Brookfield spokespersons declined to comment.Greenko\u2019s existing investors have also agreed to pump in about $1 billion through a rights issue to bankroll its expansion. The Brookfield investment, once approved, will provide long-term growth capital as the company is investing in several mega pumped storage projects in Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. There are also plans to invest in green hydrogen and green ammonia units on the east coast. The company\u2019s development pipeline includes nearly 100 GWh of pumped hydro storage projects enabling round-the-clock renewable energy (RE RTC) and a pioneering foray into the green molecules business including a gigawatt capacity electrolyser facility in India.In April, Belgium\u2019s John Cockerill and Greenko Zero C finalised the terms of a 50:50 joint venture to set up two akaline electrolyser factories of a gigawatt each in India over the next 12 to 18 months to make the lowest cost hydrogen in the country for industrial users. The facility, likely to come up on the east coast with a planned $500 million investment, will be the biggest till date outside China.Greenko plans to use its 50GW/hr pumped hydro energy storage capacity coming up in Andhra Pradesh to provide reliable 24x7 green power and overcome the intermittent nature of wind and solar power generation. The factories will supply electrolysers to Greenko\u2019s green ammonia plant and to other green hydrogen facilities of industrial users such as refineries or chemical complexes. The plants will include the full manufacturing electrolyser value chain, including state-of-the-art nickel coating and will produce electrolysers delivering H2 at 30 bars at the outlet at the highest purity level, the firms said in their joint statement.Subsequently, ONGC, Posco, Hindalco all signed MoUs for green hydrogen with Greenko Zero C. As an independent power producer (IPP) since 2004, Greenko\u2019s current portfolio is 7.5 gigawatts of operating capacity in 15 states in India across solar, wind and hydro power projects.As per Fitch Ratings calculations, capex on storage projects will continue. The first project will start operations in FY25 with a total outlay of around $1 billion for each project, it said. Around $900 million of capex is for the 1.6GW of solar capacity associated with the Andhra Pradesh storage project. The company had a readily available cash balance of $485 million at end-September 2021, against current debt maturities of $636 million, including working-capital loans of $95 million.However, analysts point to concerns about the deteriorating receivables position, due mainly to delayed payments from state-owned distribution companies. In Andhra Pradesh, because of a tariff dispute, GEH's trade receivables grew to $771 million in September 2021 from $566 million in March 2021, as per Moody\u2019s calculations.\u201cGEH's rating reflects its diverse portfolio of operating renewable energy assets backed by long-term contracts, track record and large operating scale. However, GEH's exposure to financially weak offtakers and large capital spending plans, which will keep its financial leverage high, offset these strengths,\u201d said an official. \u201cThere is a conscious pivot to move from generation to being an energy solutions provider with a technology stack added. The reliance on industrial users also offsets the payment risks from discoms that are perennially in financial duress.\u201dBrookfield is looking to multiply its current 4 GW India renewables portfolio by three to four times within the next decade in generation as well as helping corporates make the transition to decarbonise and invest in building large scale supply chain in the country, Connor Teskey, managing partner, CEO, renewable power and transition, told ET in a recent interview. By looking to be a decarbonising partner of scale, Brookfield is looking at several ways to engage with corporates in metals and mining, auto, chemicals, manufacturing, all large emitters of carbon.",

        "articleBody": "Ecommerce major, Amazon today announced its first utility-scale renewable energy projects in India \u2013 three solar farms located in the state of Rajasthan.These include a 210 MW project to be developed by ReNew Power, a 100MW project to be developed by local developer Amp Energy India, and a 110MW project to be developed by Brookfield Renewable. Combined, these solar farms have the capacity to generate 1,076,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy per year, enough to power over 360,000 average-sized households in New Delhi annually,  the company said in a press statement.Amazon\u2019s solar projects in Rajasthan will help to increase the availability and affordability of renewable energy in India, by enabling new capacity beyond what is available on the grid today.Additionally, Amazon announced 23 new solar rooftop projects on its fulfillment centers across 14 cities in India, which have the capacity to generate an additional 4.09 MW of renewable energy.This brings the total number of solar rooftop projects in India to 41 with 19.7 MW of renewable energy capacity, which will contribute to powering Amazon\u2019s fulfilment network in India.\u201cWe are bringing new wind and solar projects online to power our offices, fulfillment centers, data centers, and stores, which collectively serve millions of customers globally, and we are on a path to reach 100% renewable energy across our entire business by 2025\u201d said Adam Selipsky, CEO of Amazon Web Services.Amazon\u2019s project with ReNew Power is a 210 MW solar farm in Rajasthan \u2014 considered to be one of the largest solar corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) by a technology company in India \u2014 and the largest single business-to-business (B2B) project that ReNew Power is developing in India.\u201cAs we support India\u2019s historic clean energy transition, our work with global leaders such as Amazon is critical in decarbonizing the corporate sector and the broader economy. Organizations like Amazon set an example for other companies globally to adopt clean energy sources and, accelerate the energy transition, a pre-requisite to meet our net-zero goals,\u201d said Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO, ReNew.\u201dAmazon has executed more than 500 MW of renewable energy PPAs with Brookfield globally, and now 110 MW in India.Nawal Saini, Managing Director, Renewable Power and Transition, Brookfield said, \u201cThe new Bikaner solar park development is being undertaken as a part of the Brookfield Global Transition Fund, our inaugural impact fund focusing on investments that accelerate the global transition to a net-zero carbon economy.\u201dAmazon also announced that it is expanding its renewable energy portfolio globally, with an additional 2.7 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy capacity across 71 new renewable energy projects. This includes the company's first renewable energy project in South America \u2013 a solar farm in Brazil \u2013 and its first solar farm in Poland. Once fully operational, Amazon\u2019s global renewable energy portfolio will generate 50,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of clean energy, which is the equivalent amount of electricity needed to power 4.6 million U.S. homes each year.As the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally, Amazon now has a total of 379 renewable energy projects across 21 countries, including 154 wind and solar farms and 225 rooftop solar projects, representing 18.5 GW of renewable energy capacity. In the Asia-Pacific region, the company now has a total of 57 renewable energy projects. By the end of 2021, the company had reached 85% renewable energy across its business, it said.",

        "articleBody": "Inox Green Energy Services, a subsidiary of Inox Wind, is planning to come out with its Initial Public Offering (IPO) by October this year to raise Rs 740 crore to fund its expansion plans.  The company will focus on the Indian market initially and plans to tap the overseas market after establishing itself in this country, Inox Wind Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kailash Lal Tarachandani told PTI.  Speaking to reporters during a visit to its plant in Rajmol, Gujarat, Tarachandani said the company is planning to launch its IPO  in the next 30 to 45 days .  This is Inox Green Energy Services' second attempt to go public. In February, the company had filed the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) for its proposed IPO with the markets regulator Sebi.  However, the draft offer documents for the IPO were withdrawn in late April without disclosing any reason.  According to the latest DRHP filed on June 17, the Rs 740-crore IPO will comprise of fresh issuance of equity shares worth Rs 370 crore and an offer-for-sale of equity stocks aggregating to Rs 370 crore by promoter Inox Wind.  Elaborating on the company's business plans, Tarachandani said:  There is already enough opportunity. India has been consistent in the last few years and has a positive growth story. From that perspective, we have been quite busy. I see that there itself is a huge potential.   Asked about the company's expansion plans, Tarachandani said,  I am not ruling out the overseas market. There are new markets being developed whether it's South East Asia, some part in Gulf and African countries. I would say those are (will be focus areas) a couple of years down the line, after we have established and reached a certain level within this country.   Inox Green Energy Services at present is witnessing a 30-40 per cent growth every year.  Today, for Inox Green Services, the volume is close to Rs 160 crore and would touch Rs 400-500 crore in the next 3-4 years,  the CEO said.  Inox Green Energy Services is engaged in the business of providing long-term operation and maintenance (O&M) services for wind farm projects, specifically for Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) and the common infrastructure facilities on the wind farm, which support the evacuation of power from such WTGs.",

India has been able to build trains which are among the best in the world and the next big thing will be when the hydrogen-powered train is rolled out on August 15, 2023,  the minister for railways said. Germany rolled out world's first hydrogen-powered train last month. Hydrogen is an environment-friendly fuel. The minister, who was speaking during a programme said that Vande Bharat Express train, which is being built at the Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Chennai, was recently found to be among the best five trains in the world. This train is better than all other trains on multiple parameters. A glass of water kept in the driver's cabin stays undisturbed even when the train moves at the maximum speed indicating its stability,  Vaishnaw said. The minister said that the train took only 52 seconds to move from zero speed to 100 km per hour while the famed Bullet train of Japan took 55 seconds for the same. The train moved at a speed of 180 km per hour which amazed the world, he said.The minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked the engineers to build world-class trains that are safe, stable and consume less energy besides running at a good speed. Vaishnaw said the government has also prepared a satellite map to identify 132 district headquarter towns that needed railway connectivity. He said punctuality of trains in India was around 89 per cent at present, which needed to reach 100 per cent.",

        "articleBody": "Renewable Energy India Expo 2022 scheduled for later this month will bring in investment opportunities worth Rs 800 crore for the biogas sector, the Indian Biogas Association (IBA) said on Thursday. IBA is an industry association comprising operators, manufacturers, and planners of biogas plants.  Renewable Energy Expo (REI) is scheduled for September 28-30, 2022 at India Expo Centre, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh.  The bio-energy pavilion is supported by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) , Niti Aayog, Punjab and Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (PEDA and MEDA).  The expo focuses on renewable energy (bio-energy, solar, and wind) and energy efficiency technologies including electric vehicles and battery storage.   We are expecting almost 15,000 footfalls with the renewed interest and MNRE's push towards the bio-energy sector. This is the reason we have opted for a separate pavilion for our exhibitors,  A R Shukla, IBA President said in a statement.  With 40 more large-scale biogas plants commissioning by this financial year, IBA expects the present CBG (compressed bio gas) capacity to go up by one lakh tonne.  The industry has sold 9,000 tonne of CBG worth Rs 486 crore in last 3 years, post the launch of the SATAT scheme by the government.  Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) is a government initiative taken up to extract economic value from bio-mass waste in the form of CBG and bio-manure.   We had urged the government to double the outlay to Rs 900 crore recently. We are expecting the MNRE to announce proper incentive under Central Financial Assistance (CFA) for commissioning of new CBG projects,  Shukla added.  Gaurav Kedia, Chairman, IBA said renewable energy has a major role in meeting the energy demands of India, which is expected to reach 15,820 terawatt-hour (TwH) by 2040.",

        "articleBody": "The global energy price spike has renewed wider interest in nuclear energy and Rosatom is experiencing increased enquiries from countries across the world mainly due to nuclear plants' stable operating costs, supply reliability, and lower emissions, an executive at the Russian state company said. Rosatom is also developing renewable energy technologies and plans to offer that to India and other countries, he said. We have seen and experienced that interest (in nuclear energy) is growing in several countries,  said Vadim Titov, president, Rusatom International Network, a unit of Rosatom. The Russian nuclear energy company is currently present in 50 countries, constructing 35 nuclear power plants around the world. It employs 290,000 people and accounts for 17% of the global nuclear fuel market, as per the company's website.Nuclear energy is beginning to gain attention of governments that earlier planned to mainly use natural gas, solar and wind to replace coal in electricity generation and meet new power demand as part of climate change strategy. Natural gas prices have been sky-high for a year, making electricity extremely expensive in many markets, especially in Europe. Some countries have even reversed course, replacing pricey gas with coal.Gas, oil and coal prices have surged on the back of strong economic recovery from Covid and sluggish supply amid uncertainties caused by the war in Ukraine.The contribution of fuel cost in the final electricity price in case of nuclear plant is just about 10%, very low compared to a gas or coal-fired power plant, Titov said.  So any turbulence happening with uranium, for example, is not so crucial in final price. Therefore, a nuclear power plant is the best solution to cover the peaks of energy prices,  Titov said, adding that Europe was witnessing a  nuclear renaissance , with many countries considering to build new nuclear generation units.Increased interest in nuclear energy has also set off intense competition among nuclear power technology providers such as Russia, the US and France.  We are fully prepared for (the competition),  Titov said.  The future of energy mix is a combination of nuclear and renewables,  Titov said, adding that energy storage too would be a key solution for future. Rosatom is developing several storage projects in Russia.",

        "articleBody": "Ports-to-power conglomerate Adani Group will build three giga factories to manufacture solar modules, wind turbines, and hydrogen electrolyzers as part of its $70 billion investment in clean energy by 2030.  This ($70 billion investment plan) will see us building three giga factories in India leading to one of the world's most integrated green-energy value chains,  Asia's richest man Gautam Adani said while talking at the US-India Business Council\u2019s India Ideas Summit. The giga factories will  extend from polysilicon to solar modules, complete manufacturing of wind turbines, and the manufacturing of hydrogen electrolyzers,  he said. The factories will help generate an additional 45 GW of renewable energy to add to Adani group's existing 20 GW capacity, as well as 3 million tons of hydrogen by 2030.  The announcement comes weeks after rival billionaire Mukesh Ambani announced a fifth giga factory as part of Reliance's investment in low carbon energy.  The new giga factory for power electronics will be in addition to four giga factories announced last year for making integrated solar PV modules that will produce electricity from sunlight, electrolyzers that produce hydrogen from water, fuel cells and batteries to store energy from the grid as well as 20 GW solar energy capacity by 2025 for captive needs.  Listing out imperatives for US-India engagement, Adani said the combined value of the GDP of the two nations in 2050 is expected to be a staggering USD 70 trillion dollars or 35-40 per cent of the global economy.  By that year, the combined population of the two countries will be over 2 billion with a median age of less than 40 years as compared to the already median age of 44 in Europe and 40 in China.   When seen through these lenses of economics and the raw power of consumption it is evident that the existing 150 billion dollars of bilateral trade between the US and India is no more than a speck in the ocean. Far more needs to be done,  he said.  On the stuck trade deal, he said he believes the two nations will resolve and mutually accept some compromises.   What we cannot afford - is to remain stuck in the belief - that all aspects of trade and relations are being hampered as a result of tariffs,  he said. (With inputs from PTI)",

        "articleBody": "India is planning a massive expansion of green hydrogen production to curb its dependence on energy imports and to wean the economy off fossil fuels to meet climate targets.New Delhi is aiming for an annual production capacity of 25 million tons by 2047, according to people familiar with the plans who didn\u2019t want to be named as the information is not yet public. However, the number could change going forward, depending on technology and the country\u2019s demand outlook, they said. Media officials at the power and renewable energy ministries didn\u2019t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.Green hydrogen is widely expected to play a major role in decarbonizing heavy industries, including oil refineries, steel mills and fertilizer plants. India\u2019s current output of the fuel is very low and comes from a handful of pilot projects. While green hydrogen is regarded as a potential panacea to cut emissions, there are still major challenges in scaling up the technology and making it cost-effective. It\u2019s not certain demand growth will materialize, and the fuel may not become the first choice in transport and industry.The potential to generate low-cost renewable energy in India, the world\u2019s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, has been a driving force behind the government\u2019s carbon-free hydrogen ambitions. India\u2019s goal of getting to net zero by 2070 has found support from business tycoons, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, as well as state-run energy giants like NTPC Ltd. and Indian Oil Corp. Adani has pledged to spend $70 billion on clean energy assets, including green hydrogen, while Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd., one of India\u2019s most valuable companies, plans to add production of solar panels, electrolyzers for clean hydrogen and rechargeable batteries. French oil giant TotalEnergies SE has agreed to partner with Adani on hydrogen in India. The government is considering more ways to spur the sector, including offering production-linked incentives to make electrolyzers.Green hydrogen is made by splitting hydrogen and oxygen in water with the help of electrolyzers, powered by renewable electricity. The product can replace the use of hydrogen derived from some fossil fuels, in refineries and fertilizer plants. It has the potential to become an alternative to coal in steel mills and oil products in long-haul transport. The green hydrogen targets are part of a broader strategy for 2047, the centenary year of India\u2019s independence. The plan also includes measures to improve energy efficiency, overhaul power markets and expand manufacturing of renewable energy equipment, according to the people. ",

India is one of the most strategic hydrogen production hub due to its ample renewable energy sources coupled with progressive government policies,  said Chou, Executive Vice President (Hydrogen), Posco, adding that Greenko is right partner for green hydrogen and Ammonia due to their ability to provide round the clock renewable energy coupled with local electrolysers.  We would like to enhance cooperation to produce Green Ammonia and Hydrogen for export markets in Asia and Europe,  he added. Posco, one of the largest steelmakers in the world, has announced its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and is exploring and developing hydrogen business models.Renewable energy company Greenko is replacing fossil fuels with integrated decarbonized energy and grid assets enabling sustainable and affordable energy, with a net installed capacity of 7.5 GW across 15 states in India. Its development pipeline includes nearly 100 GWh of pumped hydro storage projects enabling round-the-clock RE power and foray into the green molecules business including a giga-watt capacity electrolyzer facility in India.\u201cThis pioneering partnership will propel the transformation of India from a carbon-based fossil energy importer to an exporter of renewable energy derived products like green hydrogen, green ammonia and green molecules,  said Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty, CEO, Greenko.Last month, Greenko tied up with Aditya Birla Group's metal flagship, Hindalco Industries to set up a renewable energy project for the supply of 100 MW of round-the-clock carbon-free power. The two companies will also work together to develop 375-400 MW of solar and wind power capacity. The project is in line with Hindalco's target to become net carbon neutral by 2050.",

The Gujarat-based company\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio of 2,021% is only behind China\u2019s Datang Huayin Electric Power Co., which has a ratio of 2,452%, among 892 listed companies in Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adani Green Energy is the most leveraged of the companies in the tycoon\u2019s empire by this metric as it takes on debt to fund the conglomerate\u2019s $70 billion pivot toward renewable energy.   93752651The eye-popping ratio adds to concern over the tycoon\u2019s fast rise and ambitious growth plans. Adani has been on a diversification spree, expanding an empire centered on ports and coal mining to include airports, data centers and cement as well as green energy. These moves have not only boosted Adani\u2019s stature in India, but his fortune, with his net worth touching almost $135 billion, making him the richest person in Asia. Yet questions are growing over whether the rise is sustainable, with a CreditSights report on Tuesday describing the business as \u201cdeeply overleveraged,\u201d and at risk of a debt trap and default in the worst-case scenario. The negative sentiment led to a drop in the shares of Adani Green and Adani Power Ltd. in Wednesday trading, outpacing the B&P Sensex. Adani Green Energy\u2019s 4.375% September 2024 dollar bonds are trading near their lowest level in about a month, set to decline for a second straight week and the biggest weekly loss since five days ended June 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The conglomerate has shrugged off concerns thus far, and has continued apace with its acquisition agenda: On Tuesday it launched a hostile bid for New Delhi Television Ltd. as part of a plan to expand its footprint into media and broadcasting. \u201cThe group\u2019s aggressive growth is mainly debt-funded, though it has a track record of obtaining third-party investments, such as TotalEnergies\u2019 $2.5 billion investment in Adani Green Energy,\u201d wrote Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sharon Chen in a July 18 note.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Engineering major Larsen and Toubro (L&T) plans to invest up to $2.5 billion (\u20b920,000 crore) in building its green energy portfolio, a senior company official said. We are looking at up to $2.5 billion of investment over the next four years in our green portfolio, depending on how the market evolves,  said Subramanian Sarma, senior executive vice-president (energy), L&T.On Saturday, L&T commissioned its first hydrogen generation plant at the Hazira manufacturing facility in Gujarat. The plant will produce 45 kg of green hydrogen daily through an alkaline electrolysis process and use it for captive consumption in the company's local manufacturing complex.The company has been evaluating prospects in green energy areas including green hydrogen, battery storage and offshore wind, among others, as it seeks to reduce its presence across the fossil fuel space and build new businesses around green energy. 93696405 We will be creating assets through our own investments. We will enter into manufacturing of key technological instruments which would be electrolysers, advanced cell batteries, fuel cells, among others,  Derek M Shah, head, green manufacturing and development, L&T. Over the past few months, the company partnered with Indian Oil Corp and ReNew Power to form a joint venture company to develop green hydrogen projects across the country. It has also tied up with the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay to jointly pursue research in the green hydrogen segment. According to L&T's FY22 annual report, the size of the green portfolio of businesses is \u20b938,843 crore, which is 38.2% of standalone revenues in FY22 compared to 33.2% in FY21.Offshore wind segmentLeveraging its offshore expertise, L&T is carving out a part of its hydrocarbon team to focus on the emerging business opportunities in offshore wind farms, which will address renewable energy requirements.  India has been implementing a lot of onshore wind farms but land is an issue. So, there is an opportunity for India to look at offshore wind farms,  said Sarma, adding that the company is looking at the Indian as well as the international market in this segment.  We have a lot of fabrication capability so there are a lot of things we can fabricate for the offshore wind farm component and supply from here. We have the capability as we do a lot of offshore projects for ONGC and Saudi Aramco,  Sarma added.The company plans to supply products like wind farm foundations and other modules for offshore wind farm projects and e-houses (customized, pre-assembled and pre-tested modular power substations). Sarma, however, clarified that the company will not enter manufacturing of wind turbines but will make other components including, the towers and the wind turbine jackets. Our team (is only) 15-20 people, but very experienced and knowledgeable,  added Sarma.",

        "articleBody": "The government is considering mandating longer duration green hydrogen and green ammonia purchase agreements of not less than 15 years to enable recovery of costs.  The green hydrogen and green ammonia projects are likely to involve higher upfront capital investment. Hence, the purchase agreement period should not be less than 15 years. There would also be provisions for further extension of the contract period on terms and conditions mutually agreed between the parties,  a senior government official said.As per bidding guidelines under preparation by the renewable energy ministry, an electronic technical and price bids-based auction for green hydrogen and green ammonia procurement is proposed for procurement over 4,000 metric tonnes per annum (mtpa) of green hydrogen and 20,000 mtpa of green ammonia.The government is also likely to allow the option of e-reverse bidding for willing procurers. The rules also propose the provision of intermediaries between green hydrogen and ammonia procurers and suppliers who can aggregate demand from more than one consumer. The option of pooling of tariff by the traders is also being considered.93696180 Procurers can avoid the risk of getting locked into higher tariffs as there are improvements in technology. The Centre is mulling providing options that intermediaries can consider to pool tariff for green hydrogen and ammonia. The pool tariff will be a weighted average of tariff arrived through each competitive bid,  the official said.The same is being proposed by the power ministry for renewable energy projects. Long-term contract is a necessary condition for this market to take off in the absence of which these capital-intensive projects will not be viable. We would prefer it if it is closer to 25 years,  said ACME Group CEO Rajat Seksaria.He said the provision to allow pooled tariffs reduces risk to both procurers and producers.  That's a very mature decision,  he said.India had, on February 17, announced plans to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 and unveiled a policy that will enable manufacturers to source renewable energy to produce hydrogen or ammonia without paying transmission charges for 25 years. The mission seeks green hydrogen consumption obligation on fertiliser units, petroleum refineries and city gas distribution networks.Most domestic oil refiners have announced big plans to produce green hydrogen and some of them have already begun the process to set up small facilities based on captive renewable power plants.",

The Union Minister of State for Science and Technology later said Prime Minister Modi's Hydrogen Vision is important for India to ensure Atma Nirbhar means of affordable and accessible clean energy, meeting climate change goals, and creating new entrepreneurs and jobs. He said, Green hydrogen is an excellent clean energy vector that enables deep decarbonization of difficult-to-abate emissions from the refining industry, fertiliser industry, steel industry, cement industry and also from the heavy commercial transportation sector.The fuel cell utilizes Hydrogen and Air to generate electricity to power the bus and the only effluent from the bus is water, therefore making it possibly the most environmentally friendly mode of transportation, Singh was quoted as saying.For comparison, a single diesel bus plying on long distance routes typically emits 100 tons of CO2 annually and there are over a million such buses in India, the release added. The operational cost of hydrogen fuel cell trucks is lower than ones run on diesel and this could bring about a freight revolution in the country, he said.  About 12-14 per cent of CO2 emissions come diesel powered heavy vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles provide excellent means to eliminate on-road emissions in this sector,  he said. ",

        "articleBody": "Engineering major Larsen & Toubro is committed to work across the green energy value chain and plans to invest up to USD 2.5 billion over the next 3-4 years, a company official said.  The investment of such a large scale in the green energy sector depends upon how the market evolves.  The statement comes in the wake of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) planning to achieve water and carbon neutrality by 2035 and 2040, respectively.   We are looking at USD 2-2.5 billion investment to start within three-four years' time,  the company's Whole-time Director and Senior Executive Vice-President (Energy) Subramanian Sarma said.  The company which plans to move in the clean energy space in a big way aims to enter into manufacturing of key technological equipment which could be electrolysers, advanced cell batteries and fuel cells among others, L&T's Senior Vice-President and head of Green Energy Business Derek M Shah said.   So, this is part of the value chain,  he explained.  The second part of the value chain, he said, is the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects adding that the company plans to make a foray into large-scale EPC projects in the green energy sector.   There are multiple customers who are now coming out. Whether it is refineries or possibly there will be gas authorities, steel plants,  Shah explained.  Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Larsen and Toubro and ReNew Power have agreed to form a joint venture company to develop green hydrogen projects across the country and capitalise on the government's ambitious plans for this sector.   We are in joint venture with two other reputed companies and we intend to be there in the space of development and in our parlance, development means we will be creating assets through our own investments,  he stressed.  The company, he said, will also create these green assets and will be in this space in the entire value chain.  Leveraging its offshore expertise, the company's hydrocarbon business is developing a part of the team to focus on the emerging business opportunities in Offshore Wind Farms, which will address renewable energy requirements and balance the portfolio.   Currently, it is a team of 15-20 people but very experienced and knowledgeable. Once we get the opportunity, we can quickly ramp up between power, hydrocarbon and within the energy segment. We have a lot of capacity which we can add to this,  Sarma said.",

        "articleBody": "Engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L&T) commissioned its first green hydrogen plant at its engineering complex in Hazira, Gujarat on Saturday.The plant will produce 45 Kg of green hydrogen daily, through an alkaline electrolysis process, which will be used for captive consumption in the company\u2019s Hazira manufacturing complex, the company said. We began working on this seven months ago. This initiative is in line with our climate leadership targets of Lakshya-2026 that will help reduce greenhouse gases footprint for us as well as our clients by approximately 300 tonnes per annum,  said Subramanian Sarma, senior executive vice president (Energy), L&T, adding that the company plans to expand this initiative to its other manufacturing facilities and its customers.93683595L&T, which has forged multiple partnerships for development of technology and projects in the green hydrogen space over the past year, is in talks with around a dozen companies in the steel, cement and refining segment for providing green hydrogen solutions. We are talking to almost all major refineries in India, both public and private. We are also talking to international customers and also some of the major steel plant players to provide green hydrogen solutions,  added Sarma. The Hazira hydrogen unit is spread across 3000 sq. meters and has been set up at the cost of over Rs 25 crore. The company said it will blend 15% hydrogen with natural gas as fuel, and oxygen will supplement the existing usage in cutting and welding applications at its manufacturing units in Hazira.The green hydrogen plant is designed for an electrolyser capacity of 800 kW comprising both alkaline (380 kW) and Polymer electrolyte membrane (420 kW) technologies and will be powered by a rooftop solar plant of 990kW peak DC capacity and a 500 kWh battery energy storage system (BESS). As we scale up, the per unit cost will keep dropping. The company will be setting up a Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser in future,  said Derek M Shah, Head, Green Manufacturing and Development, L&T, adding that green hydrogen is key to the company's plan to reduce carbon footprint. As part of its ESG commitments, L&T plans to achieve water neutrality by 2035 and carbon neutrality by 2040, making green hydrogen an integral part of its clean fuel adoption policy.",

        "articleBody": "State-owned power giant NTPC on Friday said it has started capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the flue gas stream at its thermal plant in Vindhyachal.  As part of its commitment towards Net Zero by 2070, NTPC Ltd, India's largest integrated power company has captured its first CO2 on 15th August 2022 from flue gas stream of 500 MW coal based power plant (Unit-13) at Vindhyachal Super Thermal Power Station (VSTPS),  a company statement said. According to the statement, this plant is designed to capture 20 tonnes of CO2 every day. This initiative will pave the way for scaling up CO2 capture technology and greening the coal power generation. At the same location, NTPC is also setting up a green hydrogen generation plant, which will use Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers to produce 2 tonnes per day of hydrogen. Subsequently, 20 tonnes per day of captured CO2 and 2 tonnes per day of hydrogen will be utilised to produce 10 tonnes per day of green methanol through a heterogeneous catalytic process. The integrated CO2 to methanol project has been conceived, designed, engineered and awarded by the R&D wing of NTPC -- NTPC Energy Technology Research Alliance (NETRA) and executed by VSTPS Green Chemical Department in coordination with NETRA. The total installed capacity of NTPC is 69,454 MW. It is also expanding its footprint in new business areas like green hydrogen, waste-to-energy and e-mobility. India's largest power producer is aiming for a 10 per cent reduction in net energy intensity by 2032. NTPC has become India's first energy company to declare its energy compact goals as part of the UN High-level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE). Besides power generation, NTPC has diversified into producing energy through cleaner and greener sources, such as hydro, wind and solar. It also provides green hydrogen solutions. The power major has also forayed into a variety of business areas, including fuel cells, e-mobility and waste-to-energy.",

        "articleBody": "ReNew Power has tied up USD 1 billion loan with a consortium of 12 international lenders led by Rabobank. The loan has been tied up through a special purpose vehicle and will be deployed for its hybrid Round-the-Clock (RTC) battery-enabled project, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.  ReNew Power has tied up with 12 international lenders, led by Rabobank, for the largest External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) project finance loan in the country's renewable sector, for any single project, according to the company.  The interest rate, after hedging, is expected to be lower than the company's current average cost of debt on its balance sheet.  ReNew has signed a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for this project, which will see setting up of wind and solar farms across Karnataka, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.  Sumant Sinha, founder, chairman and CEO, ReNew Power, said in the statement,  This loan -- the single-largest project finance in India's renewable sector -- highlights the interest of global lenders in ReNew as it helps spearhead India's historic clean energy shift and shows its continued ability to access financing at much lower rates than several years ago, despite the current volatility in the currency markets and a rising interest rate environment.    This also shows the financial community's faith in our growth plans, innovation, project execution abilities, and sound monetary management,  he added.  The RTC project will supply power day and night and compete against the baseload of fossil-fuel energy providers such as coal.  In April, Mitsui & Co Ltd, a global general trading and investment firm, partnered with ReNew for this RTC project and picked up a 49 per cent stake.  The project will provide power to SECI at the rate of Rs 2.90 per unit to begin with, which will increase 3 per cent annually for 15 years and then stabilise for the remaining 10 years of the 25-year PPA.  This ECB loan follows ReNew's refinancing last month of its dollar-denominated bonds with domestic borrowings, making it the first Indian renewable company to do so, it stated.  ReNew Power develops, builds, owns and operates utility-scale wind and solar energy projects as well as hydro. ReNew has a portfolio of ~12.8 GW of renewable energy projects across the country.",

        "articleBody": "Global utilities and energy companies, pension and infrastructure-focussed funds are among those that have been approached by NTPC as it starts fundraising for its clean energy platform. NTPC\u2019s plans\u2014to first carve out its renewable energy assets into a special purpose vehicle and sell a stake subsequently to raise funds\u2014will form part of the government\u2019s National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP).Feelers have been sent and preliminary discussions have been held with Abu Dhabi-listed TAQA, Malaysia\u2019s state-owned Petronas, Canadian pension fund CPP Investment Board (CPPIB), Brookfield, KKR & Co. and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners among others to gauge their interest, said people aware of the development.ET was the first to report July 11 that NTPC is looking to raise Rs 5,000 crore by selling a maximum 49% stake in its green energy subsidiary and had appointed SBI Capital Markets as advisor.Non-disclosure agreements are getting signed with prospective suitors after NTPC issued an advertisement seeking expressions of interest (EoIs). The exact quantum of the stake sale and the amount to be raised is yet to be finalised.NTPC told the stock exchanges last month that it plans to hive off 15 of its renewable energy projects into NTPC Green Energy Ltd, a newly formed entity. The assets being separated have a book value of Rs 10,000 crore. Additionally, its 100% stake in NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd is also being transferred to NTPC Green Energy, which will now be the main vehicle for its green energy ambitions.  Use of renewable energy for decarbonisation of power and industry, as well as NTPC\u2019s entry into all areas of non-fossil including civil nuke power, should aid in its transition,  said CLSA analyst Bharat Patel.NTPC, TAQA, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Petronas didn\u2019t respond to queries. Brookfield, KKR and CPPIB declined to comment.NTPC has 2.3 GW renewable energy capacity under operation and 3.4 GW being built. It has a target of 15 GW renewable energy capacity by FY26.However, analysts at Jefferies expect it to reach only 10 GW by that date. It won the most renewable energy bids awarded in FY22 (19%) compared with ReNew Power\u2019s 10%, Tata Power\u2019s 6% and Adani\u2019s 4%. It has also signed a memorandum of understanding to set up ultra-mega solar parks totalling 24 GW, creating enough of a pipeline for it to reach its FY32 goal of 60 GW. NTPC\u2019s CMD exuded confidence on improving future profitability while exploring ways to \u2018make energy flexible\u2019 by expanding RE footprint,  said Edelweiss Institutional Equities analyst Swarmin Maheshwari.  We understand NTPC is transitioning from conventional power, but not restricting itself to only RE capacities. It is exploring other profitable opportunities as well. Further monetisation of RE assets in FY23E is a key variable to watch out for. NTPC is also building India\u2019s biggest 5 MW electrolyser in Madhya Pradesh as a part of its circular economy initiative to capture carbon and convert it into methanol. This facility will be converted from grey to green hydrogen (GH2) with power supply from its 5 MW small hydro and 500 kW rooftop solar units. This alone could make the company become one of the largest exporters of GH2 and green ammonia/methanol in Asia due to its strategic location.Acid Test Even though NTPC can offer the assurance that projects will be backed by secured, long-term power sale agreements, renewable energy analysts are of the view that its reluctance to give up control may discourage global investors. They are looking at passive investors who will only provide capital. The IRR expectations will not suit many funds, barring the sovereign or pension fund entities or government-backed utilities that are seeking a toehold in India,  said an executive involved on condition of anonymity.  Even if the new investor gets board representation, NTPC will be controlling the show and would want to ideally consolidate the numbers.       93601393CPPIB, TAQA, Petronas and others are keen to expand their clean energy footprint. CPPIB has been looking at M&A opportunities\u2013SB Energy, Sprng Energy, Tata Power Renewables--but could not close most of them. Petronas spent almost a year negotiating with Tata Power and ReNew for stake purchases without success. Tata eventually sold close to 10% in its arm Tata Power Renewables to BlackRock and Mubadala for Rs 4,000 crore, valuing the renewable energy business at Rs 35,000 crore. Global utility company Shell bought Sprng Energy platform from PE firm Actis for $1.5 billion in April.",

        "articleBody": "Renewable energy company Greenko Group and aluminium maker Hindalco Industries have entered into an agreement to set up a green energy project that will have a capacity of 375 MW-400 MW in Odisha. The project, which will have wind and solar capacity, will supply power to Hindalco's aluminium smelter in Odisha, Greenko said in a statement on Thursday.   Hindalco Industries Limited and Greenko Energies Private Limited have entered into a commercial arrangement to set up a renewable energy (RE) project for supply of 100 MW round-the-clock carbon free power. The arrangement covers the development of 375-400 MW of solar and wind capacity,  it said.  As part of the agreement, Greenko said it will design, construct, partly own and operate the solar and wind facilities. The company will also make available appropriate storage capacity from its hydro pump storage project in Pinnapuram, Andhra Pradesh to ensure continuous power supply.  The project will be set up as a captive generation facility under a 25-year offtake arrangement to supply power to Hindalco's Aditya aluminium smelter in Odisha, enabling reduction of CO2 emissions by 6,80,000 tonnes annually, Greenko said without sharing any financial details of the deal.  According to Greenko, aluminium smelting requires reliable and continuous power. Hindalco will also be the first aluminium company in India to use such round the clock carbon free power for smelting.  Hindalco Managing Director Satish Pai said the agreement with Greenko is a significant step towards reducing our carbon footprint.  We are guided by our long-term commitment of becoming net carbon-neutral by 2050.   Greenko's CEO and Managing Director Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty said that the company firmly believes clean energy sources backed with competitive and proven storage technologies like hydro pump storage projects offer a competitive, reliable and sustainable alternative to consumers to support their decarbonisation journey.  Hindalco Industries, a part of Aditya Birla Group, is the world's largest aluminium company by revenues.",

        "articleBody": "GAIL (India) Ltd wants to double its share capital as well as add specialty chemicals and clean energy to its line of business as it looks to diversify business beyond natural gas transmission and distribution. GAIL has sought shareholder approval to increase the authorised share capital of the company to Rs 10,000 crore from the current Rs 5,000 crore to help raise finance for its expansion plans over the next 3-4 years.  The firm is laying natural gas truck pipelines to create a national gas grid as well as expand city gas distribution as part of the government's target of more than doubling the share of natural gas in the primary energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030.   GAIL is having a capex plan of approximately Rs 30,000 crores in next 3-4 years. These projects will be funded partly through internal resources and partly through debt, which may also include the equity route,  the firm said in a notice to shareholders.  Further, the company may also look at issuing bonus equity shares to its shareholders, it said.  India's largest state-owned natural gas processing and distribution company also sought to amend the Memorandum of Association (MoA) to allow entry into new business areas.  It wants to diversify into the specialty chemicals business, explore the possibility of taking equity in energy exchange and pursue acquisitions in solar glass and module manufacturing besides setting up of wind, and solar power plants, including Round The Clock power generation through storage system.  The company wants to set up ethanol manufacturing plants to produce green fuel from biomass that can be mixed with petrol.  The firm is also keen to enter the green hydrogen business as well as diversify into providing risk management services for its customers, the shareholders' notice said.  GAIL has already awarded a contract aimed at setting up one of the largest Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzers in the country to produce green hydrogen by the end of 2023.  It will produce around 4.3 tonnes of hydrogen per day (about 10 megawatts capacity) with a purity of about 99.99 per cent.  GAIL said the project would be installed at the company's Vijaipur Complex, in the Guna district of Madhya Pradesh, and would be operated on renewable power.  Earlier this year, GAIL kicked off the nation's first project for blending hydrogen into the natural gas system.  Hydrogen-blended natural gas is being supplied to one of the company's joint ventures - Avantika Gas Ltd (AGL) which retails CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.  The green push is part of the government's ambitious target for ramping up India's non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030 and meeting 50 per cent of the nation's energy requirements from renewable sources.",

The West Seti project is one of the much-hyped projects envisioned for development about four-decades ago. Both the projects are located in the far west of Nepal. Both are storage type projects. The board approved the draft of the memorandum of understanding to be signed with the Indian company, according to a statement by the Investment Board.The NHPC Limited, an Indian government hydropower board under the Union Ministry of Power, had submitted a proposal in May to develop the projects.The West Seti project, first envisioned some six decades ago, is located on the Seti river in far western Nepal. The proposed dam site is located 82 km upstream of the confluence of the Seti and Karnali rivers, forming part of the Ganges basin.The new project sites are located at elevations ranging from 550 to 920 metres and are spread across six districts. The estimated cost of the project, according to the Investment Board, is $2.4 billion.Besides approving the MoU to be signed with the NHPC Limited, the board meeting also instructed the office of the IBN to initiate preparations for approving investment for the development of the 679MW Lower Arun Hydropower Project. India's SJVN Limited which is also developing the 900MW Arun 3 project was awarded the Lower Arun project in July last year.As Nepal and India are seeking to increase cooperation in the hydropower sector lately, the Indian state-owned company came up with the proposal to develop the West Seti projects.The development comes after Nepal and India in April issued a joint vision statement on energy, which talks about expanding mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation in the power sector including joint development of power generation projects in Nepal; development of cross-border transmission infrastructure; bi-directional power trade with appropriate access to electricity markets in both countries based on mutual benefits, market demand and applicable domestic regulations of each country; coordinated operation of national grids; and institutional cooperation in sharing latest operational information, technology and know-how.Particularly, Indian state-owned companies have been more active and willing to develop hydropower projects in Nepal.",

Hence, the sugar industry in Maharashtra will also be called as the energy industry in times to come,  National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories Limited Chairman Jayprakash Dandegavkar told PTI. Sugarmills produce ethanol. December 1 to November 30 is its production cycle. In 2020-21, Maharashtra produced 100.36 crore litres of ethanol through 78 plants.Since December 2021, the state has generated 75.88 crore litres of ethanol through 85 businesses, he added. Next year's production could reach 130 to 140 crore litres. He predicts 90 ethanol-producing establishments.Considering the limitations for natural fuel products, sugar producing companies will also produce electricity, hydrogen along with ethanol in future, Dandegavkar said. Talking about the future pathway of ethanol production in the state, he said,  This production growth is mainly based on finance and government policies along with viability and new technology.  The government has to keep a balance between labour wages, sugar rates and also ensure good returns for sugarcane producers, he said. In this scenario, the sugar industry cannot maintain its regular growth, he said. He demanded that the government also help financially in the ethanol production.  The co-operative sugar industry works on a 'no profit-no loss' policy. Therefore, it does not have huge finances needed to undertake new projects,  he said. The government helps in establishing a co-operative sugar factory. In the same manner, it should also financially help in ethanol production, he added. [With PTI inputs]",

        "articleBody": "Madhya Pradesh has set an ambitious target of generating an additional 20,000 Megawatt (MW) of green power by 2030 through renewable energy sources, including setting up of a solar plant in the Chambal region once notorious for dacoits, and supplying it to other states. The state currently produces 5,500 MW of green energy through various renewable power sources and a major part of it is sourced through solar power.  We have set a target to produce an additional 20,000 MW of green power by 2030 through renewable energy sources in the state for supplying it to other states,  Madhya Pradesh energy and renewable energy department's principal secretary, Sanjay Dubey, told PTI.  Besides, in the next three-four years, the government has set a target to generate 10,000 MW of green power by establishing the 1,500 MW capacity Agar-Shajapur-Neemuch solar park, 600 MW Omkareshwar floating solar power plant, which is among the world's biggest such facility, 750 MW hybrid project, 950 MW hybrid storage Chattarpur project, 500 MW Kusum-A and 1,250 MW Kusum-C projects will be implemented among others,  he said. Megawatts are used to measure the output of a power plant or the amount of electricity required by an entire city. Dubey said under a hybrid facility, both solar panels and windmills are established to generate green energy by taking advantage of Sun rays as well as wind velocity by taking the advantage of both mediums. Similarly, under the Kusum Scheme, small renewable energy plants are being set up by farmers and others for generating 2-3 MW of green power, the senior official said.  This will turn them (farmers) from producers of traditional food grains into developers of clean energy which will also supplement their income,  he said. The state government is also setting up a 1,400 MW solar energy power plant in the Chambal region in the Morena district. This region was earlier ill-famous for bandits, but now the Chambal expressway and the solar power plant are coming up in this area as part of the government's development plans. Dubey said the government is also planning to establish a solar power plant in the vast Chambal ravines which will be implemented in the next few years. Referring to the Omkareshwar Floating Solar Project, he said that it was Madhya Pradesh's first, India's largest and one of the biggest floating solar power plants in the world. Under the first phase, 278 MW of power will be generated for which a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was inked recently. The floating solar project is being implemented under the 'Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks Scheme (UMREPP). The entire 600 MW of power generated from the Omkareshwar Floating Solar Project will be procured by the state discoms (distribution companies) through the Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company (MPPMCL), an official associated with the project said. The first phase of the 278 MW capacity of this project is proposed to be completed by September 2023. The Omkareshwar project would be one of the multi-purpose projects in India wherein apart from the existing utilities such as irrigation and hydropower generation, solar energy will also be generated along with the promotion of tourism, the official said. In addition, the project will bring many benefits to the people of Madhya Pradesh such as a reduction of about 12 lakh tons of carbon emission in meeting the energy demand, saving of about 1200 hectares of precious land that may find utility in agriculture or other industry for boosting the state economy. No need for land has effectively eliminated the requirement of displacing the people from their natural habitat, which is quite pleasant from the social point of view, the official added.  In ground-mounted solar projects, underground water is used to clean the solar panel. However, in the floating solar project, water from the reservoir will be used for cleaning purposes which would flow back into the reservoir, leading to virtually no loss of water besides saving the valuable groundwater,  the official explained. In addition to saving groundwater, it will be possible to save the reservoir water from evaporation from the floating solar project.  Due to low evaporation, there will be an annual saving of about 32.4 million cubic meters of water. This amount of water saving is almost enough to meet the daily demand of water for a city like Indore for up to 112 days,  the official added.",

        "articleBody": "Sectors like power and steel, which are today among the major carbon emitters, need heavy investment to cut their carbon footprint. This would require companies to have access to significant 'green finance', top industry executives said during a panel discussion as part of the ET Sustainability Forum.Green finance includes financial instruments lent with the intention of promoting environmental sustainability, usually at a lower cost compared to other sources of funding.While there is significant green finance available globally, there is a paucity of such capital in India and hence there is a need of a mechanism for Indian companies to tap into the global capital, the executives said during the discussion, moderated by Dhruba Purkayastha, the India director at the Climate Policy Initiative.For example, the steel sector. It is considered as a 'hard-to-abate' sector given the heavy reliance on coal in blast furnaces and for generating electricity, said Seshagiri Rao, the joint managing director of JSW Steel. The situation is particularly bad in India. The average carbon emissions per tonne of steel (production) globally is 1.85 tonnes. In India, it is 2.5 tonnes,  the steel executive said.While the industry is gunning for efficiency in energy and material consumption and increasing the use of electricity from renewable sources, these measures alone won't fix the emissions of the sector, he said. For that, there is  huge  research going on to free the sector from its coal addiction and replace it with hydrogen. If not today, in the near future, we're very confident that hydrogen will become affordable (enough) to replace coking coal,  he said. And this is where there is a need for green financing options to fund this transition, he added.There are also challenges around what projects get classified as green and thus get access to green finance, he said. For instance, there could be projects that may help reduce emissions but may not be termed as 'green'. Like an investment in a new blast furnace which may be significantly more efficient than the one it replaces, but isn't a green project as it will still have significant carbon emission.The power sector is an even bigger emitter than steel.By some estimates, power generation causes 30% of all carbon emissions. If the sector moved to sustainable means of power generation, it would also help the transport sector cut its carbon footprint given its increasing reliance on electric mobility, said Praveer Sinha, managing director and chief executive of Tata Power. Mobility generates about a fifth of all emissions.However, the issue with renewable sources of power generation is that they are intermittent. While there is a range of solutions being explored to overcome this challenge, it requires significant investments.Globally, there is a big trend towards decentralisation of power generation with renewable energy, Sinha said. All kinds of consumers - whether commercial, residential or industrial - could generate their own power from sources like solar and wind. They can also sell the excess power back to the grid or to the local community. So, just from being a user of energy, they are now a producer and a seller of energy,  he said. This would be of relevance particularly in lesser-served communities and rural areas. This movement will empower communities and businesses, he said.This movement for decentralisation of power generation again needs support from innovative financing instruments, Sinha said.  The whole financing arrangement that we have today needs to undergo a huge transformation. Today, financing is concentrated on the credit risk of the customer. But that needs to make way for a retail-driven system where lending is based on the borrower's ability to leverage the energy generated to pay back, he said. Such a transformation in lending would need support from both the government and the whole lending ecosystem.While the industrialists outlined their requirements and concerns, lenders said there were a lot of challenges at their end too. We have to do a lot more to be able to attract finance into India,  said Kaku Nakhate, country head - Bank of America India.  Globally, I think most of the financing has gone into sustainability-linked or ESG-linked bonds. Blended finance has been another such vehicle. Sustainability - and ESG-linked financing looks to promote social and governance aspects also along with environment conservation. Green finance is a subset of these and focuses on environmental aspects, as per a description given by the United Nations Environment Programme. Blended finance is a combination of private or public capital and philanthropic or development funds in such a way that the latter assume more risk in a development project. The 'blending' helps increase the pool of funds, as every dollar of the concessional capital attracts multiple orders of private capital, and thus it helps make a larger impact.In the current year, around 10.5% bonds in emerging markets were ESG-linked, whereas the number was just 0.7% in India, Nakhate said. The share was as high as 25% and 20% in China and South Korea.Anirban Mukherjee, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group, concurred with Nakhate. Green investments of $200 billion are needed annually to meet India's net-zero target, he said. Of that, the country is managing just about $20 billion currently. Even there, a large part comes from traditional public and domestic sources. So, the need to deepen green finance and tap into international funds is really stark and really immediate,  he said.  Specifically, in terms of the blended finance. Nakhate agreed on the need for popularising the concept of blended finance in India.  Multilateral agencies are willing to put in initial funds for newer kinds of clean technologies which probably have not seen the light of the day,  she said.  And that's when banks can come in with slightly costlier capital and the blended finance will be much cheaper, which will make the projects viable. There have been instances of using blended finance in India before, according to Mukherjee, but that was often to tackle a singular problem of taking a proven technology to newer markets or scaling a proven technology. However, in the case of green finance, the problems are multifaceted - right from the technology being unproven to markets being new and a lack of scale.For this, there is significant concession capital available globally that makes decision based on the cost of inaction, he said. There is a need to then structure together and use creativity to bring in the capital which is available. But the structures need to be built and the regulators and the banks have to come together to do that,  he said.Beyond blended finance, regulators may also look into opening up the Indian bond market to make it easier for Indian companies to tap into global capital, Nakhate said.  To attract capital, we do need to open up bond markets and get them included in indices. Further, Indian regulators could also think about bringing in the concept of 'green bank', she said. A green bank specialises in using innovative financial tools in partnership with the private sector to fund the kind of green and transformational projects that Rao and Sinha mentioned above. Countries like Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Switzerland, the UK, all have green banks,  the Bank of America executive said.  We always talk about the bad bank. But we could change the nomenclature to green banks. The Reserve Bank of India has taken cognisance of the industry's requirements and published a discussion paper on climate risk and sustainable finance on its website last month, RBI chief general manager Sunil Nair said.The central bank has also published a survey of Indian and foreign banks on what they think about sustainable finance. This, coupled with the discussion paper, will set the tone going forward as to how climate risk and sustainable finance can be taken forward,  Nair said. RBI has also been permitting banks to lend for renewable energy generation through priority sector lending, he said. But it doesn't stop there. A lot more work needs to be done and the Reserve Bank is conscious of that. The amount of finance required for climate risk and sustainable finance is huge,  the RBI executive said.  So, we want the stakeholders to respond to the discussion paper. Post that we will come with a roadmap as to how we should go forward. Green banking has percolated down not only into bonds or loans, but it is also going into areas like supply chain financing and cash management, said PD Singh, managing director and head of corporate banking at JP Morgan India. However, unless there is a financial incentive, cleaner technologies will not get adopted very quickly, he said.Sharing an anecdote, Singh said JP Morgan had engaged with Bridgestone for supply-chain financing. Suppliers of the tyre maker would get better pricing if they have a superior ESG-rating. This gives the suppliers and the entire ecosystem an incentive to be more transparent and move towards higher sustainability. What is important is that all of this is replicable, and all of this is in the public domain for other corporates to step in and take action on,  Singh said.",

        "articleBody": "Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is targeting to replace at least a tenth of its current fossil-fuel-based hydrogen at its refineries with carbon-free green hydrogen as part of a decarbonization drive. To start with, the nation's largest oil firm is setting up green hydrogen plants at its Panipat and Mathura refineries, IOC said in its latest annual report.   The company is venturing into green hydrogen production and is targeting 5 per cent of hydrogen produced by it as green hydrogen by 2027-28 and 10 per cent by 2029-30,  it said.  Hydrogen is the cleanest known energy source but it barely exists in a pure form on Earth. It either is bounded with oxygen in water or with carbon to form hydrocarbons like fossil fuels.  Once separated from other elements, hydrogen's utility increases: it can be converted into electricity through fuel cells, it can be combusted to produce heat or power without emitting carbon dioxide, used as a chemical feedstock, or as a reducing agent to reduce iron ores to pure iron for steel production.  Most of the hydrogen currently produced is grey which is produced from fossil fuel and as carbon emissions.  Green hydrogen is produced using electrolysis powered by renewable energy to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen, creating an emissions-free fuel.  As part of its decarbonisation drive, IOC is looking to replace hydrogen made by unabated fossil fuels with green hydrogen.  Petroleum refining accounts for almost 42 per cent of total global hydrogen demand.   At present, the refineries are the major consumption centres for hydrogen, used for desulfurisation. The current dominant hydrogen production process is highly carbon-intensive being based on the Steam Methane Reforming process.   On the other hand, green hydrogen i.e. hydrogen produced from electrolysis of water, using renewable energy, has a zero-carbon profile, making it the preferred form of hydrogen in the context of a carbon neutral future,  IOC said.  In the annual report, IOC Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said to meet the net-zero commitment, the Indian government has announced the Green Hydrogen and Ammonia Policy to boost green hydrogen production to 5 million tonne by 2030 and make India an export hub for this clean fuel.   Aligning with the national priority, Indian Oil will be producing green hydrogen in stages at the Mathura and Panipat refineries. As a first step, we will be implementing a 5 KTA (40 MW) green hydrogen plant at Mathura Refinery and a 2 KTA (16 MW) plant at Panipat Refinery,  he said.  To sync with the entire hydrogen value chain, the firm has forged crucial collaborations to develop green hydrogen production assets, associated renewable assets and manufacture electrolysers.   This will be a gamechanger as electrolysers contribute to approximately 30 per cent of the overall cost of green hydrogen,  he said.  IOC, he said, is also exploring multiple hydrogen production pathways, including solar electrolysis, biomass gasification and bio-methanation.   The hydrogen produced will be used for fuelling 15 fuel cell buses to establish the efficacy, efficiency and sustainability of the fuel cell technology and hydrogen production processes. In addition, we will commission a hydrogen dispensing station at the Gujarat Refinery to enlarge hydrogen-based mobility coverage,  he said.  IOC said it is looking to expand its footprint in the renewable power space from the present level of about 240 MW capacity.  While renewable energy plants currently produce electricity equivalent to 5 per cent of its electricity consumption, IOC is targeting nearly 5 GW of renewable electricity generation capacities by 2025 for use at its oil refineries.  The refinery sector is an emissions-intensive sector, accounting for 3 per cent of global carbon emissions.",

We believe that industry will move away from diesel to biodiesel, gas, electric and hydrogen fuel cell and for a certain point of time, all three of them will co-exist,\u201d Satyakam Arya, MD of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles, told ET.Arya said Daimler had placed a long-term bet on hydrogen fuel cell or EVs, but the company is watching the transition to CNG very closely. \u201cCNG was not part of our global plan, but it appears in a country like India, CNG will have a role to play in the coming 10-20 years, so we will have to work on our solution too,\u201d he added.The intermediate and medium commercial vehicle segment \u2014 9 to 25 tonnes \u2014 has started witnessing CNG penetration in excess of 25% with diesel prices rising consistently. With the expansion of CNG filling station infrastructure across the country, the acceptability has risen and DICV is missing out on the shift currently due to lack of alternatives in the space.On the powertrain options for the future, without defining the specifics, Arya said different segments will be dominated by different fuel choices spread over a time period and DICV is working on a range of options. \u201cFor the last-mile segment, we believe that shift away from diesel will happen faster with CNG and EVs. There is a case for all EV trucks with a range of 500 km per trip, beyond that hydrogen fuel cell is ideal. Globally, Daimler is moving towards all EVs and hydrogen fuel cell; India\u2019s plans are aligned to global plans with local solutions,\u201d assured Arya.The company has completed 10 years of operation in the country. Reviewing the performance of the last decade, Arya said DICV has achieved everything beyond its volume target, but with a strong tailwind, the company hopes to utilise the plant capacity within the next few years.\u201cLooking ahead, we are sitting on the cusp of a massive growth in the CV market. I fundamentally believe India will be the strongest growing economy in the next 5-10 years and that will reflect on the truck sales and DICV will seek to capitalise on the same.\u201dDaimler currently has a capacity of 36,000, which is likely to be utilised in a short span of time, but capacity is not a constraint, says Arya. \u201cBy balancing the lines, we can double our capacity (72,000) by just hiring new employees. These are very short lead times; we will react quickly.\u201dTo de-risk the operations from global supply chain challenges, DICV has consistently built its localisation content beyond 93% with the next pit-stop to be 95% and beyond says Arya, that de-risks the Indians operation as much as possible from supply chain disruption as one saw during Covid.\u201cWhen you go through two economic cycles... It helped us become much more resilient. It helped us remain nimble and today we have a strong foundation to enter into a strong growth phase,\u201d added Arya.",

        "articleBody": "LONDON: Almost two-thirds or 163 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable power capacity added last year had lower costs than the cheapest coal-fired power plants in G20 countries, a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) showed. Last year, the cost of electricity from onshore wind fell by 15%, offshore wind fell by 13% and solar photovoltaic (PV) fell by 13% compared to 2020, the report said.  Renewables are by far the cheapest form of power today,  said Francesco La Camera, director general of IRENA.  Renewable power frees economies from volatile fossil fuel prices and imports, curbs energy costs and enhances market resilience, even more so if today's energy crunch continues.  Prices of coal and natural gas have rocketed over the past year, putting a strain on industries, businesses and consumers. European gas prices have spiked in particular, mainly due to concerns about Russian gas supply since the war in Ukraine. IRENA said high European gas prices will make new gas-fired generation in Europe increasingly uneconomic over its lifetime. Fuel and carbon permit costs for existing gas plants might average four to six times more this year than the lifetime cost of new solar PV and onshore wind commissioned in 2021, the report said. Between January and May this year, the generation of solar and wind power might have saved around $50 billion in fossil fuel import costs in Europe. The report said not all material cost increases have been passed onto equipment prices and project costs yet. If material costs remain elevated, price pressures this year will be more pronounced.",

Specific support includes support for ASEAN countries in the Asian roadmap towards carbon neutrality, which will be expanded to include India,  Hagiuda said at the Sydney Energy Forum, co-hosted by the Australian government and the International Energy Agency.Hagiuda said the region needs to work on diversifying where it gets its energy from, in light of the ongoing energy crunch due to loss of Russian energy supplies. Against that backdrop, considering the current energy crisis, stable energy supply and market stability are critical as the basis for promoting a transition towards carbon neutrality,  Hagiuda said. For that we must engage in improving our energy independence through things such as a further push for diversification of energy sources of supply. Ahead of his trip to Sydney for talks with Quad partners Australia, India and the United States, Hagiuda said on Tuesday he would press the United States and Australia to boost LNG output and stable supply to Japan.He made no comment in his speech about the outcome of those talks which took place earlier on Wednesday.",

        "articleBody": "Bengaluru: An innovative technology to produce hydrogen from biomass has been developed by a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). The team was led by S Dasappa, Professor at the Centre for Sustainable Technologies, and Chair of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Energy Research at IISc. India uses nearly 50 lakh tonnes of hydrogen for various processes in different sectors, and the hydrogen market is expected to grow substantially in the coming years, says Dasappa in a statement issued by Bengaluru-based IISc on Tuesday.  But most of the hydrogen we currently use comes from fossil fuels through a process called steam methane reforming route,  he says. Now, his team has found a way to extract green hydrogen from biomass, a renewable energy source. The process consists of two steps. In the first step, biomass is converted into syngas - a hydrogen-rich fuel gas mixture - in a novel reactor using oxygen and steam. In the second step, pure hydrogen is generated from syngas using an indigenously developed low-pressure gas separation unit. Both these technologies, developed in Dasappa's lab, ensure that this process is a highly efficient method of generating green hydrogen - it produces 100 g of hydrogen from one kg of biomass even though only 60 g of hydrogen are present in one kg of biomass, the statement said. This is because in this process, steam, which also contains hydrogen, participates in both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions (in homogeneous reactions, reactants are in a single phase whereas in heterogeneous reactions, the reactants are in two or more phases), it was explained. The production of green hydrogen using this process is environmentally friendly for another reason - it is carbon negative. The two carbon-based by-products are solid carbon, which serves as a carbon sink, and carbon dioxide, which can be used in other value-added products.  This indigenous technology is a step towards achieving the goal of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' of the Honourable Prime Minister,  says Dasappa. The technology also dovetails nicely with the National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap, an initiative of the Government of India that aims to promote the use of hydrogen as a fuel and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, he adds. The project was supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India. The team also acknowledged the support of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited in scaling up the technology to produce 0.25 tonnes of hydrogen per day for use in hydrogen-powered fuel cell buses. Dasappa believes that green hydrogen could be used in several other industries as well - in the steel industry to decarbonise steel, in agriculture to manufacture green fertilisers, and in many sectors currently using hydrogen produced from fossil fuels.  Moreover, the same platform can be used for methanol and ethanol production,  he adds.",

        "articleBody": "To reduce its carbon footprint, JSW Steel has earmarked a sum of Rs 10,000 crore to increase use of renewable energy to replace thermal power and other green initiatives, its Chairman Sajjan Jindal said. Various steel makers use coal to generate thermal power for captive use.  According to a Ministry of Steel document, globally, the iron and steel industry accounts for around 8 per cent of total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In India, it contributes 12 per cent to the total CO2 emissions. Thus, the Indian steel industry needs to reduce its emissions substantially in view of the commitments made in the COP26 climate change conference.   We have earmarked Rs 10,000 crore for investments to reduce our carbon emissions through various initiatives, such as increasing the use of renewable energy to replace thermal power, reduce our fuel rate through improved raw material quality via beneficiation, and deployment of Best Available Technologies (BAT),  Jindal said.  JSW Steel has already contracted for 1 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy, of which 225 MW has become operational in April 2022, and the balance will come on stream in phases, Jindal said in his address to shareholders in the company's Annual Report for FY 2021-22. He further said the expansion of the company's Vijayanagar plant from 12 MTPA to 19.5 MTPA is underway, and capex cost is well below global benchmarks.  The company's ongoing expansion projects are oriented towards producing steel with higher use of renewable power, best-in-class digitalisation to achieve operational efficiency and best available technologies to reduce associated CO2 emissions.   We are consciously going beyond basic steel and are consistently maintaining the share of VASP (value added and special products) in our product mix to over 50 per cent,  he said.  The energy transition has provided a significant opportunity for steel players, with huge investments being made in renewable power generation, and transmission and distribution infrastructure, all of which are steel-intensive.   At JSW Steel, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) is core to everything we do. We have committed to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity... by 42 per cent by 2030, compared to the base year of 2005, aligned with India's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC),  Jindal said.",

Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water using renewable energy or from biomass. Green hydrogen can help India significantly reduce its dependence on imported fuel and, hence, inter-ministerial interventions are required to promote the production and the usage of green hydrogen,  Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said.India is among the large economies that have committed to net zero emission targets. Niti Aayog is of the view that green hydrogen will play a significant role in the country's move towards its decarbonisation targets. Three hydrogen corridors should be developed across the country based on state grand challenges,  Niti Aayog said in the report, which has been prepared along with the Rocky Mountain Institute.  The governments can provide grants and loans to startups and projects, support entrepreneurs through incubators and investor networks, and put in place regulations that manage first-mover risks. The report has suggested that the government use public procurement and purchase incentives (for green hydrogen) to create demand in niche markets and attract private investment, while promoting export of green hydrogen and green hydrogen-embedded products through a global hydrogen alliance.",

        "articleBody": "Hyundai Motor Co has decided to delay the launch of its upgraded hydrogen-powered Nexo SUV to 2024 due to issues with its fuel cell development, a South Korean newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing the auto parts industry. The South Korean automaker had planned to kick off mass production and sales of its new Nexo in the second half of next year, but has decided to postpone to 2024, the Seoul Economic Daily reported. The Nexo was launched in 2018. The report also said the launch schedule for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles at Hyundai Motor's premium brand Genesis had not been decided yet, as the project to develop the first Genesis brand fuel cell vehicles was suspended late last year. Hyundai Motor did not have comment. Hyundai sold 3,978 Nexos in South Korea and exported 120 between January and May this year, according to the company's sales data. In September, Hyundai Motor Group, which houses Hyundai Motor, Kia Corp and Genesis, announced plans to offer hydrogen fuel cell versions for all its commercial vehicles by 2028, adding it would develop fuel cell vehicles for Kia and Genesis that could be launched after 2025. Analysts said Hyundai would be reevaluating its hydrogen fuel cell business, especially for passenger cars, because of the slow growth of the hydrogen fuel cell car market and the need to focus on the transition to electric vehicles (EVs).  With the growing global EV market, it would be likely that Hyundai could be reassessing its priority list as demand for EVs continues to grow, while the market for hydrogen cars still remains relatively small,  said Co Soo-hong, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities.",

        "articleBody": "NITI Aayog has proposed setting up of Green Hydrogen Corridors in the country while providing grants to startups as well as support to entrepreneurs to promote production, storage and export of green hydrogen in India. In a report titled \u2018Harnessing Green Hydrogen - Opportunities for Deep Decarbonisation in India\u2019 released on Wednesday, the Aayog also suggested that there is a need to facilitate investment through demand aggregation and dollar-based bidding for green hydrogen.Green hydrogen or green ammonia is defined as hydrogen or ammonia produced by way of electrolysis of water using renewable energy and the hydrogen or ammonia produced from biomass. Most large economies including India have committed to net zero targets and the Aayog feels green hydrogen will play a significant role in helping India achieve its decarbonisation targets.\u201c'Three hydrogen corridors should be developed across the country based on state grand challenges,\u201d the Aayog said in the report jointly developed by the Rocky Mountain Institute.\u201cThe governments can provide grants and loans to startups and projects, support entrepreneurs through incubators and investor networks and put in place regulations that manage first-mover risks,\u201d it added.\u201cGreen hydrogen can help India significantly reduce its import dependence on imported fuel and hence inter-ministerial interventions are required to promote the production and the usage of green hydrogen,\u201d Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog said.The report has suggested that the government use public procurement and purchase incentives (for green hydrogen) to create demand in niche markets and crowd in private investment while promoting export of green hydrogen and green hydrogen-embedded products through a global hydrogen alliance.The report forecasts that hydrogen demand in India could grow more than fourfold by 2050, representing almost 10% of the global hydrogen demand with steel and heavy-duty trucks likely to account for 52%Emphasising that the roadmap for green hydrogen should also identify a timeline and scale of manufacturing support for electrolysers, the report said India may aim for 25 GW of electrolysers by 2030, while also investing $1 billion in research and development to catalyse the development of commercial green hydrogen technologies across the value chain.",

        "articleBody": "India will need 115 GW of renewable power generation capacity and 50 billion litres of demineralised water supply to achieve the goal of five million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, as per the EY India-SED Fund report. In this decade, industrial feedstock-based applications will drive the demand for green hydrogen, said the report. Price parity between green and grey hydrogen production will determine the speed and scale of transition, said the EY-SED Fund report titled 'Accelerating Green Hydrogen Economy', released at the CII's conference on 'Green New Energy for a Net Zero India' in Bengaluru. The report highlights that India's ambition to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 will need 115 GW of renewable power generation capacity and 50 billion litres of demineralised water supply. To get a sense of this scale, the current all-India installed capacity of renewable power generation is 113 GW as of May 2022.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing global conflict are stark reminders of how India's dependence on energy imports and other commodities linked to global supply chains can threaten its strategic interests. The emergence of green hydrogen as a promising low carbon feedstock and energy carrier for industrial applications is a boon for India's long-term energy security, sustainability and self-reliance,  Somesh Kumar, Partner and National Leader, Power & Utilities, EY India, said. The levelised cost of green hydrogen production and storage (LCOH) is currently Rs 400/kg. Around 40-50 per cent of this cost can be attributed to the renewable energy power plant, 30-40 per cent for electrolyser stack and balance of system, including demineralised water supply and 20-30 per cent for compressed storage, the report said. Sivaram Krishnamoorthy, Deputy Director, SED Fund, said,  The race to decarbonise energy-intensive industries depends on the competitiveness of green hydrogen supply chain and enabling policy ecosystem to make this happen. State governments have a key role to play in implementing recently notified green hydrogen policy and green energy open-access rules 2022 to support the industry in reducing the cost of production . It has suggested reducing the cost of renewable power generation and supply for GH2 production by giving waiver of intra-state transmission charges, waivers, clarity and certainty of open access charges, allowing banking of surplus energy and fungibility of green hydrogen and renewable purchase obligations.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said a huge market for clean energy technologies is emerging in India, calling G-7 countries to invest in research, innovation, and manufacturing in this field.Modi, during his speech at the session on 'Investing in a better Future: Climate, Energy, Health' at G7 Summit in Germany, said ancient India has seen a time of immense prosperity.  Then we have also tolerated the centuries of slavery, and now independent India is the fastest-growing big economy in the whole world. But during this whole period, India did not let its commitment to the environment get diluted even a single bit. 17 per cent of the world's population resides in India. But, our contribution of global carbon emissions is only 5 per cent. The main reason behind this is our lifestyle, which is based on the theory of co-existence with nature,  he said.He further said:  All of you will also agree with this that energy access should not be the privilege of the rich only - a poor family also has the same rights on energy. And today when energy costs are sky-high due to geopolitical tensions, it is more important to remember this thing. By taking inspiration from this principle, we delivered LED bulbs and clean cooking gas door-to-door in India and showed that millions of tons of carbon emissions can be saved while ensuring energy for the poor. Our dedication to climate commitments is evident from our performance. We have achieved the target of 40 per cent energy-capacity from non-fossil sources 9 years before time. The target of 10 per cent ethanol-blending in petrol has been achieved 5 months before time. India has the world's first fully solar power operated airport. India's huge railway system will become net zero in this decade,  said the Prime Minister.Modi said when a large country like India shows such ambition, other developing countries also get inspiration.  We hope that the rich countries of G-7 will support India's efforts. Today, a huge market for clean energy technologies is emerging in India. G-7 countries can invest in research, innovation, and manufacturing in this field. The scale that India can provide for every new technology can make that technology affordable for the whole world. The core theories of the circular economy have been an integral part of Indian culture and lifestyle,  he added. I called for a movement called LIFE - Lifestyle for Environment - in Glasgow last year. This year on World Environment Day, we launched the Global Initiative for LiFE campaign. The goal of this campaign is to encourage an eco-friendly lifestyle. We can call the followers of this movement Triple-P i.e. 'pro planet people', and we should all take the responsibility of increasing the number of Triple-P people in our own countries. This will be our greatest contribution to the coming generations,  Modi said.The Prime Minister further said humans and planet health are interconnected.  Therefore, we have adopted the approach of one world, one health. During the pandemic, India found many creative ways to use digital technology in the health sector. G7 countries can help India to take these innovations to other developing countries. Recently we all celebrated the International Day of Yoga. In times of the Covid crisis, Yoga has become a great tool for preventive health for people all over the world, this helped many people to maintain their physical and mental health,  PM Modi said.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries Ltd., controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is assessing new technologies for making electrolyzers in its efforts to produce low-cost green hydrogen in the country.As part of the push, the company also plans to bid for any production-linked incentives the government may offer to encourage the technology, Kapil Maheshwari, president for new energy at Reliance, said at the BloombergNEF summit in New Delhi on Wednesday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government unveiled the first phase of its green hydrogen policy in February, offering a range of incentives for companies to set up projects. India is considering offering more \u201csweeteners\u201d for producers, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Raj Kumar Singh said last week.Green hydrogen has drawn tens of billions of dollars in investment commitments from investors, including Ambani and rival tycoon Gautam Adani. The fuel, produced by splitting water with the help of clean energy like wind power, is seen as critical to decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries such as oil refineries and steel mills, helping meet global targets to zero out emissions and fight global warming. Maheshwari said India needs to provide certainty about policies and help build a market for green hydrogen by requiring some industries to purchase the fuel, a step the government is already discussing.Reliance will pursue an aggressive target to produce green hydrogen at $1 per kilogram by the end of this decade, Ambani said last year. At the time, the cost of producing the fuel was between $2.22 and $4.62 a kilogram in India. Ambani and Adani have pledged more than $140 billion in green investments, as their fossil fuel-driven empires pivot away from oil and coal. Green hydrogen is central to this shift, as the two tycoons champion the government\u2019s ambition to make India a global leader for production and exports of this fuel. ",

        "articleBody": "High in Chile's sun-drenched Atacama desert, Gaston Caceres and five other engineers are working on plans for a huge solar-powered hydrogen project that reflects their country's ambitions to become a leading exporter of the fuel.  Green  hydrogen, which is extracted from water using electrolysis in a process powered by renewable energy, is touted as a potential game changer in the race for net-zero emissions by cutting fossil fuel dependence to fight climate change.But despite Chile's abundant supplies of wind and solar energy, Caceres is candid about the challenges ahead for the nascent project - not least its $4 billion-$5 billion estimated price tag. There aren't tax breaks or other governmental benefits for these type of big project developments,  he said.Global efforts to reduce dependency on oil and natural gas have gained urgency as the Ukraine war disrupts Europe's energy supplies, and nations from Chile to Brazil and India are vying to become major green hydrogen producers.Hydrogen and its derivatives could cover up to 12% of global energy demand and account for 10% of reductions in carbon emissions by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), although other estimates are lower. Green hydrogen can be a game changer for the energy transition,  said Francesco La Camera, IRENA's director-general, noting the fuel's particular advantage in hard-to-electrify sectors such as transportation and heavy industry.But not all countries are well-placed to lead production and export of the fuel. You obviously need to have renewable energy and loads of it,  said Jonas Moberg, chief executive of The Green Hydrogen Organisation.HIGHER COSTFor countries that do, like Chile - which is bidding to become a green hydrogen hub in Latin America along with Brazil and Argentina, other hurdles remain.  One of the main challenges that green hydrogen faces today is its higher cost compared with fossil fuels and other alternative low-carbon technologies,  said La Camera, though he noted that costs could plunge as the industry and its infrastructure become established.Kickstarting large-scale production will require huge upfront investments, ramping up the large-scale production of electrolyzers needed to produce green hydrogen, hefty tax breaks to mitigate high initial costs and the development of local expertise, analysts say. We produce virtually no green hydrogen today, so there's an awful lot of laws and things that need to come. We are breaking new territory here,  Moberg said.According to a June report by global energy consultancy DNV, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen will only account for 5% of the global final energy mix by 2050 and raising that will require stronger policies, incentives and higher carbon prices.TAX BREAKSChile launched its national green hydrogen strategy in 2020, aiming to become the world's cheapest producer of the fuel and a leading export hub from 2030. About 100,000 jobs, could be created, according to the plan.The Atacama desert project involves the construction of a huge electrolysis plant to produce ammonia - which can subsequently be converted into green hydrogen and is easier to transport, with construction due to start in 2027.Besides the large initial investment, Caceres said the plant will need an affordable lease on state-owned land and a favorable regulatory framework to make ammonia production competitive.In May, Chile's state development office Corfo signed agreements with three companies as part of six other projects it selected last year to fund industrial green hydrogen production, which it says could double current production worldwide.Corfo expects $1 billion in investments and production of 45,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year.Thousands of kilometers from the Atacama in southern Chile, at the Haru Oni wind power demonstration plant, several international companies are aiming to combine captured carbon dioxide (CO2) with green hydrogen powered by wind turbines.Markus Speith, Siemens Energy project lead for the $50-million pilot project, said Chile was chosen for its stable investment environment and  high and very constant  wind speed. We want to show it's possible, and this gives us the confidence of investors and politicians,  Speith told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Power from the plant, which is expected to start operating by the end of 2022, will be used to produce green hydrogen via electrolysis, which will in turn be used to generate synthetic methanol/gasoline, a low-carbon alternative fuel for transport.Carmaker Porsche plans to buy the green methanol produced, Speith said, reflecting strong interest in the sector from companies seeking to decarbonize.JOB HOPESThe Brazilian state of Ceara, which lies in the country's poorer northeast, has signed preliminary investment deals with 18 companies that want to build green hydrogen plants to tap into corporate demand for clean energy.Nearly half of Brazil's electricity currently comes from renewables, such as wind and hydro - making it a prime destination for green hydrogen investment, said Maia Junior, Ceara's secretary of economic development and labor.  If there's a green hydrogen OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), Brazil will be at the table,  he said.It could prove a boon for the state, potentially creating thousands of jobs, including about 3,000 jobs per plant during the construction phase and when operational, up to 200 direct jobs and 2,000 indirect jobs, Maia said.Speith said green hydrogen had  potentially huge  job creation possibilities, particularly in the engineering and construction sectors, highlighting its appeal in a region where the COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread job losses.As India - the world's No. 3 greenhouse gas emitter after China and the United States - eyes green hydrogen development as a way to wean itself off labor-intensive and highly polluting coal, industry analysts say the sector could ease the transition by creating new jobs. It will be a generational transition as there is a huge requirement of skilled manpower,  said Samrat Sengupta, vice-president of EKI Energy Services Ltd, which helps businesses with climate change and sustainability solutions.In its drive to become a leading production and export hub, India's government is incentivising green hydrogen projects by waiving inter-state transmission charges and offering grid connectivity on priority.Federal officials are also looking to create demand for the fuel by mandating the use of green hydrogen in the production of fertilizers, steel and petrochemicals, and providing financial support to manufacture electrolyzers.The government hopes such incentives will help India produce enough hydrogen to reduce spending on imports of liquefied natural gas and fertilizer, while also bringing the nation closer to its 2070 target for net-zero emissions.Billionaire business leaders Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani have announced plans to produce the fuel, and state-run oil, natural gas and thermal companies are inviting bids to set up projects.While the green hydrogen sector is still in its infancy, with experts comparing it to solar energy in India 15 years ago, future jobs are expected, said Sumant Sinha, chairman and chief executive of ReNew Power, India's leading clean energy company.ReNew power is in a joint venture with India's top refiner Indian Oil Corp and engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro to build green hydrogen projects. Given the likely overall global demand, and the large investment requirement for green hydrogen and its derivatives, it's unlikely that one country (e.g. Brazil, Chile) will be able to provide enough product to meet this demand,  Sinha said. There will be several hubs, including India, which will have to be developed to meet this demand. ",

        "articleBody": "After years of dabbling, major oil companies are finally planning the kind of large-scale investments that would make green hydrogen a serious business. They\u2019re chasing a very particular vision of a low-carbon future \u2014 multibillion dollar developments that generate vast concentrations of renewable electricity and convert it into chemicals or clean fuels that can be shipped around the world to power trucks, ships or even airplanes. The oil majors have been building multibillion-dollar projects since forever,  said Julien Rolland, head of power and renewables at commodities trader Trafigura Group Pte Ltd.  This green hydrogen, green ammonia stuff will be the new energy industry. The plan is well suited to the companies\u2019 natural strengths in project management and their financial heft, but even with those advantages they\u2019re still making a big bet on an unproven technology that could fall short of its potential.\u201cI don\u2019t think any company out there has developed anything to these kinds of scales,\u201d said Gero Farruggio, head of Australia and global renewables at consultant Rystad A/S.Deep PocketsThis month has seen a flurry of big news about hydrogen.BP Plc is taking the lead in the $36 billion Asian Renewable Energy Hub, a project that aims to install 26 gigawatts of solar and wind farms over a vast 6,500-square-kilometer (2,500 square-mile) stretch of Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara region, and use the electricity generated to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Once fully developed, each year it would produce about 1.6 million tons of green hydrogen or 9 million tons of ammonia, which can be used to make fertilizer. TotalEnergies SE has joined Indian billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s conglomerate in a venture that has the ambition to invest as much as $50 billion over the next 10 years in green hydrogen. An initial investment of $5 billion will develop 4 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity, about half of which will feed electrolyzers producing hydrogen used to manufacture of ammonia. The venture could expand to 1 million tons of annual green hydrogen production by 2030, driven by 30 gigawatts of clean power.It's only a matter of time before Shell Plc follows with a megaproject of its own, said Paul Bogers, vice president for hydrogen at the company. Shell is looking for a place where there are sufficient wind and solar resources for a large-scale project that would play to its strengths, he said in an interview on the sidelines of the Financial Times Hydrogen Summit in London. The size of these projects isn't something done by a small startup,  Bogers said.  It requires deep pockets. US giant Chevron Corp. is ready to spend billions on a mixture of green and blue hydrogen, which uses a chemical reaction to split natural gas and capture and store the carbon dioxide. Smaller players in the oil market are also getting involved, with Trafigura looking at a number of mid-size green hydrogen projects, such as a 440-megawatt development near Adelaide, Australia.While the trading house doesn't have the balance sheet of an oil major, it's looking to develop large-scale projects of multiple-gigawatt capacity, including one n South America, and then bring on a larger partner to actually build it, Rolland said.Lifeline to the FutureThe global supermajors still spend the bulk of their money on oil and gas, but are devoting a growing proportion to low-carbon energy. That has included major investments in areas well outside their core business -- offshore wind farms, solar plants, battery technology and electric-car chargers. \u201cElectrons don't need the type of infrastructure\u201d that the oil majors specialize in, said Meredith Annex, an analyst at BloombergNEF. But hydrogen is a molecule and  these are companies that understand molecules and infrastructure design around molecules.\u201d Until recently, the majors\u2019 hydrogen plans have been modest. BP is developing an electrolyzer at its Lingen refinery in Germany and its Castellon plant in Spain, making green hydrogen for use in those facilities. Shell started up a 10 megawatt plant producing hydrogen for its Rheinland refinery in Germany last year and already has plans to expand its capacity. The nature of hydrogen, with its complex processing plants, pressurized pipelines and storage facilities, and the specialized tankers required for distribution, makes it \u201ca lifeline into the future\u201d for Big Oil, said Annex.There\u2019s another natural synergy for companies that have a long history of seeking the largest concentrations of energy and the biggest markets in the world and finding low-cost ways to connect them. For green hydrogen \u201cone of the key attributes is having very competitive renewable energy resources,\u201d said Tom Ellacott, a senior vice president at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. BP has gone to Australia because \u201cyou've got a lot of sun,\u201d while TotalEnergies is in India because \u201clow-cost ammonia is potentially a very big market.\u201dLong GameWhile giant projects may be the future of green hydrogen, there's a long way to go before they're proved to be commercially viable, said Pierre-Etienne Franc, chief executive officer of Hy24, a joint venture between asset managers Ardian SAS and FiveT Hydrogen. You can't move from 10 megawatt size to gigawatt size just like that,\u201d Franc said. First it will be necessary to build facilities at the scale of hundreds of megawatts -- 10 times the size of pilot projects currently operating in Europe. Those will enhance the operational knowledge and the electrolyzer manufacturing capacity necessary to scale up to the next level, he said.Rystad estimates that the average size of a green hydrogen electrolyzer is 3 to 4 megawatts. That should increase by 20 times by 2025, leaving a lot of groundwork still to be done for gigawatt-scale developments.\u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go before one of these projects actually starts seeing significant capital investment,\u201d said Farruggio. \u201cIt will possibly be a stretch to see this coming in prior to 2030. That fits with the announced timetables for full expansion of the BP and TotalEnergies\u2019 green hydrogen ventures, and is well within the 2050 deadline for the companies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Large-scale hydrogen, unproven though it may be, could represent the best chance for the current generation of oil majors to remain as key players in a mid-21st century, climate-compatible energy industry. \u201cAt some point, oil and gas will have to start declining to get on that Paris-aligned trajectory,\u201d said Ellacott. Green hydrogen is the best fit for a new low-carbon profit center because it\u2019s \u201csuch a big long-term growth market, it's really in the majors' sweet spot in terms of synergies with their existing businesses.''

        "articleBody": "An expert panel constituted by the government has suggested that India has enough potential to produce hydrogen from domestic coal and the country should strongly pursue this option. This assumes significance in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi annoucing hydrogen mission on India's 75th Independence Day.  Hydrogen is a clean fuel and can serve as a possible substitute to liquid and fossil fuels. It is also the most abundant element in the universe, making up more than 90 per cent of all known matters.   India has an opportunity to produce hydrogen from domestic coal and we may aggressively pursue this option in our overall hydrogen ecosystem,  the expert committee said in its report on roadmap for coal to hydrogen production.  The panel also suggested for setting up of a couple of semi-commercial gasification units to convert coal to hydrogen.  The integration of Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) units along with gasification, it said, can be explored so that blue hydrogen thus produced is more acceptable.   The gasification technologies may be selected based on assessment of the potential for eventual commercial upscaling and keeping the option of biomass co-gasification along with coal subject to availability of biomass in the close vicinity of such gasification units,  the panel said.  The coal gasification units should be set up near the hydrogen demand centres or close to the coal mines.  The cost of transportation of hydrogen would be high at present and hence there was a need to examine the economics before deciding upon the locations of gasification plants.   Alternatively, we could establish the plants closer to the natural gas grid so that hydrogen thus produced could be injected to some extent i.e. up to 18-20 per cent into the natural gas pipelines, as to that extent of hydrogen injection in the natural gas pipelines may not need the modification of the gas pipelines,  the panel recommended.  This, it said, will facilitate the utilisation of hydrogen produced from coal in the industries currently using imported natural gas.  The coal ministry had earlier said that coal has not been encouraged elsewhere because of the fear that while extracting hydrogen via coal (from the moisture embedded in coal) there may be carbon emission.  Currently, hydrogen is used mainly in refining-- to remove sulphur from crude oils -- and fertilizer production except small usages in other sectors like chemicals, textiles, and electronics.  Total demand of hydrogen in 2021 was around 6.7 million tonnes, of which around 54 per cent or 3.6 million tonnes was in petroleum refining, three million tonnes in fertilizer production and 0.1 million tonnes in gas-based DRI (Direct Reduced Iron).  It is expected that the demand of hydrogen in the country may shoot up to 11.7 million tonnes by 2030 with 6.8 million tonnes in refinery, 4.6 million tonnes in fertilizer and around 0.3 million tonnes in DRI steel making.  Looking at the future, hydrogen has a number of potential applications that could be significantly expanded across a range of end-use sectors from transportation to electric power to industry. For example, hydrogen can be used in fuel cells to power passenger and commercial vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, buses, trains and waterborne vessels.  It is projected that the demand can increase to around 28 MT by 2050, driven by cost reductions in key technologies, as well as the growing imperative to decarbonise the energy system. Demand will continue to be largely focused in industry sectors, either expanding in existing sectors such as fertilizers and refineries, or growing into new sectors such as steel.  Hydrogen can also be stored for use in power generation to manage load in power systems when intermittent renewables are not available.",

        "articleBody": "Adani Transmission Limited (ATL) on Wednesday said its $700 million revolving loan facility has been tagged as 'green loan' by Sustainalytics. Sustainalytics, a Morningstar Company, provides analytical environmental, social and governance (ESG) research, ratings and data to institutional investors and companies.  In a statement issued on Wednesday, ATL said its  USD 700 million revolving facility has been tagged as green loan by Sustainalytics. This provides assurance on the green loan framework for the revolving facility.   A revolving loan facility is a flexible financing tool that provides the borrower with the ability to draw down or withdraw, repay, and withdraw again.  On receiving the green load tag, Anil Sardana, MD and CEO, ATL said  ATL has been a signatory to energy compact goals as part of COP26 and the energy compact with the UN in November, 2021.   This is the testament to the overall philosophy of ATL to facilitate transition to green energy by increasing the share of renewable power in the overall grid, in line with India's commitment on climate change.   In October 2021, the company in a regulatory filing had announced raising USD 700 million for its under-construction transmission asset portfolio through the definitive agreements signed with leading international banks.  The revolving nature of the facility will help the company to achieve its goal of 20,000 ckt km (circuit kilometer) of transmission lines by 2022, ATL had said.  The projects associated with the USD 700 million revolving facility are being implemented in Gujarat and Maharashtra.  In Gujarat, the projects are part of the government's Green Energy Corridor Projects (GEC), dedicated to the evacuation and transmission of renewable energy.  While in Maharashtra, the projects are conceptualized to strengthen Mumbai's transmission system by enhancing grid stability and providing a stable transmission network, which shall promote higher share of renewable energy in the overall grid mix ensuring more penetration of green energy to the end consumers.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Amara Raja Power Systems, a part of the USD 1.3 billion Amara Raja group, has bagged a contract from NTPC to set up India's first green hydrogen fuelling station in Leh. The pilot project is being set up in Leh's extreme conditions at a height of 3,600 meters above sea level, Amara Raja Power Systems said in a release on Monday.  This is in line with the government's vision of achieving net-zero carbon emission by 2070.  A part of the National Hydrogen Energy Mission, this would be a precursor to large-scale green hydrogen mobility and storage projects, and would be useful for studying and deploying multiple fuelling stations across the country, it said.  The completion of the project would usher in a new era of emission-free transport in and around Leh, it said, adding India would be among few countries to take a lead in this green mobility space.  To begin with, NTPC plans to ply five hydrogen fuel cell buses in the region, the company said.   The potential for hydrogen as an energy source of the future is substantial and projects such as these are critical to showcase this,  said Vikramadithya Gourineni, Executive Director at Amara Raja.  According to the company, green hydrogen will be produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, using an electrolysis process powered by electricity generated by renewable energy sources.  The hydrogen produced in this manner will leave no carbon footprint.  The pilot project will produce a minimum of 80kg/day of 99.97 per cent pure hydrogen which will be compressed, stored and dispensed, it said.   This challenging project will reaffirm our EPC expertise, and we are very excited about being the first to enter the green hydrogen infrastructure space,  Dwarakanadha Reddy, Business Head of the EPC division at Amara Raja said.",

India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, has expedited efforts to double ethanol blending with gasoline to 20% from the current 10% across the country from 2025/26. The Indian government fixes the ethanol purchase prices for fuel retailers - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp -- every marketing year. However, the fuel retailers have announced they will pay extra to ethanol manufacturers to compensate for high energy and power costs, a BPCL spokesman said. The three state fuel retailers have announced the 'relief scheme' for June 1 to Nov. 30. The companies will pay an additional Rs 1,604 ($20.62) per kilolitre for ethanol produced from sugar cane juice, and Rs 1,493 for B- heavy molasses and Rs 1,179 for ethanol produced from C-heavy molasses, the letter showed. The B-heavy molasses juice has some sucrose content left in them for sugar production, whereas C-heavy molasses is a cane by-product that has no sugar content left in it. For a kilolitre of ethanol produced from damaged foodgrains and rice, the relief is fixed at 2,337 rupees and 1,437 rupees, the letter showed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, and is encouraging industries to switch to cleaner options including renewable and biofuels to cut carbon footprint.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Sunday that India has achieved the target of 10 per cent ethanol blending in petrol five months before deadline. Making the announcement at a programme on the 'Save Soil Movement', which coincided with the World Environment Day, Modi cited a number of measures taken by his government to protect the environment, saying its efforts have been multi-dimensional despite the country having a negligible role in climate change.The rise in ethanol blending in petrol from two per cent in 2014 to 10 per cent now has reduced carbon emission by 27 lakh tonnes and saved Rs 41,000 crore of forex reserve. This has also brought Rs 40,000 crore of income to farmers, he added.The National Biofuel Policy, introduced in 2018 aims at reducing the dependence on imports by relying on fuel blending. With bioethanol, biodiesel and bio CNG main fuels in focus, it includes the Ethanol Blending Programme (EPB), which includes the production of second generation ethanol (derived from forest and agricultural residues), which also increases the capacity to produce fuel additives, R&D in feedstock, which is the starting material for ethanol production, and financial incentives for achieving these goals.According to the report released by the  Expert Committee on Roadmap for Ethanol Blending in India by 2025 , 20% ethanol blending is within reach. The report further stated the annual plan for gradually rolling out the E20 ethanol in India. It also suggests the specific responsibilities of Union Ministries, State Governments and vehicle manufacturers for the production, supply and gradual rollout of 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025.The report also mentions the various benefits of ethanol blending on the environment. The immense benefits can accrue to the country by 20% ethanol blending by 2025, such as saving Rs 30,000 crore of foreign exchange per year, energy security, lower carbon emissions, better air quality, self-reliance, use of damaged food grains, increasing farmers' incomes, employment generation, and greater investment opportunities.In his address, the prime minister said India has also achieved its goal of having 40 per cent of its installed power generation from non-fossil fuel-based sources nine years before the deadline.The 'Save Soil Movement' is a global initiative to increase awareness about deteriorating soil health and bring about a conscious response to improve it, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) had said in a statement.",

        "articleBody": "There is huge potential for deep and broad cooperation between India and the European Union (EU) in the field of green hydrogen including through initiatives like the EU\u2019s Global Gateway and thereby accelerate green transition, according to Ugo Astuto, Ambassador of the European Union to India. His comments assume significance in the backdrop of India\u2019s National Green Hydrogen Mission being in the advanced stages of approval as well as the EU bringing out last month its \u2018REPowerEU Plan\u2019 to end the EU's dependence on fossil fuels including from Russia as well as to tackle the climate crisis. Astuto was speaking at an event organised by RIS in collaboration with the Ministry of External Affairs and the EU-European External Action Service on India-EU \u2018Cooperation in Green Hydrogen: Towards Sustainable Energy Transition\u2019 on Thursday. Noting that green hydrogen will help reduce fossil fuel dependency, he said there is a need to use investments, including those mobilized by the Global Gateway to develop and strengthen the green hydrogen ecosystem. The EU\u2019s \u2018REPowerEU Plan\u2019 aims, among other things, to boost Green Hydrogen Partnerships to facilitate green hydrogen import (to the EU) and support the \u2018decarbonisation in the partner countries\u2019. REPowerEU has \u201cset a target of 10 million tonnes (mt) of domestic renewable hydrogen production (in the EU) and 10 mt of renewable hydrogen imports (to the EU) by 2030.\u201d India\u2019s proposed National Green Hydrogen Mission aims to transform the country into a green hydrogen hub and a global leader in exports of the commodity. Incidentally, India announced its Green Hydrogen Policy in February this year. Green hydrogen is also among the focus areas of the 2016 EU-India Clean Energy and Climate Partnership. Dr Vandana Kumar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said from the perspective of energy transition and energy security there is a need to create a strong pipeline of green hydrogen projects including electrolyser and manufacturing facilities in India so that the supply side can be strengthened. In this regard, it is important to bring down the costs of green hydrogen production and transportation, she said. Sandeep Chakravorty, Joint Secretary (Europe West), Ministry of External Affairs, said the main challenge now is to start implementing joint green hydrogen projects, find markets for green hydrogen and green ammonia as well as address challenges in technology (including issues related to storage and transport) and financing. Tudor Constantinescu, Principal Adviser to the Director General, Directorate-General for Energy, European Commission, said the EU\u2019s REPowerEU Plan aims to accelerate the creation of a robust green hydrogen ecosystem and forge sustainable partnerships. He said several factors including the Ukraine crisis could lead to EU\u2019s efforts being expedited to ensure greater economic, technological and regulatory integration in green hydrogen between itself and partner countries including India. The development of the green hydrogen ecosystem within the bilateral CECP has received a boost with the India-EU Energy Panel agreeing to enhance cooperation in green hydrogen by setting up an India-EU Hydrogen Forum to exchange best practices/policies; discuss clean hydrogen production and technologies; and share information on existing and upcoming hydrogen projects. Also helpful is the decision to set up a bilateral \u2018Financing Investment in Clean Energy Platform\u2019 as well as several bilateral initiatives between India and EU Member States.",

It has also entered into an agreement with the Maharashtra government for the supply of 200 MW of green power, the company said in a statement. ReNew said,  It has signed definitive agreements to acquire an operating wind and solar portfolio of 527.9 MW, comprising 471.65 MW of wind and 56.25 MW of solar assets. The company has also signed a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) with MSEDCL for a 200-MW solar project . The total enterprise value of these agreements is around USD 388 million, it said. The definitive agreements come with PPAs with state distribution companies in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Telangana, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. ReNew will supply electricity at a tariff of Rs 2.43/kWh (kilowatt-hour) for 25 years from its asset in Rajasthan to Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL).  The clean energy transition in India must happen at an increasingly rapid pace to meet the expanding energy requirements of the country, and to strengthen its longer-term energy security. Given the recent electricity shortages and blackouts, customers are even more keen to sign new power agreements to ensure future supply,  the company's Chairman and CEO Sumant Sinha said. ReNew is one of the largest renewable energy Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in India and globally. The company develops, builds, owns, and operates utility-scale wind energy, solar energy, and hydro projects.

        "articleBody": "China aims to double its wind and solar capacity by 2025, according to a new road map that also allows for more coal-fired power plants to bolster energy security. The world's biggest polluter earlier estimated it needs to double wind and solar use by 2030 to deliver on its pledges under the Paris climate accord. The latest plan -- if implemented -- means China might reach that goal earlier. But Beijing has also ramped up reliance on coal-fired power plants in recent months to support its ailing economy as the Ukraine war pushes up global energy prices. The country's central economic planner said 33 percent of power supply to the national grid will come from renewable sources by 2025, up from 29 percent in 2020, in a document released Wednesday.  In 2025, the annual power generation from renewable energy will reach about 3.3 trillion kilowatt-hours... and the wind power and solar power generation will double,  the plan said. China, already the world's largest producer of renewable energy, has accelerated investment in solar and wind projects to tackle pollution at home, which researchers say kills millions every year. Beijing has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. Investment in solar energy nearly tripled in the first four months of the year to 29 billion yuan ($4.3 billion) compared with January to April investment in the previous year, data from the National Energy Administration shows. But China's energy policy has remained a two-headed beast, with the country burning about half the coal used globally each year to power its economy. Policymakers further embraced coal as the Ukraine war pushed up prices of oil and natural gas. Premier Li Keqiang said coal underpinned China's energy security in an emergency meeting last week to address economic woes, and the central bank has approved a $15 billion credit line to fund coal mining and coal-fired plants. In March, the cabinet ordered miners to dig up 300 million tons of extra coal this year. Local governments started building new power plants last year that will boost capacity from coal by the most since 2016, after an energy crunch paralysed swathes of the economy. Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said  energy security -- avoiding another energy shortage and managing geopolitical risks -- is the overwhelming priority  for China with the economic outlook uncertain. The latest energy plan says renewables will supply  50 percent of the growth in power consumption  to 2025, lower than previous official estimates and signalling more room to expand coal power.  The planners are projecting, or preparing for, faster demand growth which would see fossil fuel use and emissions still increase,  Myllyvirta said.",

        "articleBody": "Record green energy output reduced Indian dependence on coal in May, despite 23.5% growth in power demand, contributing to a rise in utilities' coal inventories, a Reuters analysis of government data showed.Surging supply from renewables will go some way towards mitigating India's coal shortage amid extraordinarily rapid growth in demand, which has forced the country to reopen mines and return to importing the fuel.The share of renewable energy sources in power output rose to 14.1% in May from 10.2% in April. Coal made room for it, dropping to 72.4% of Indian generation from 76.8%.Coal's share was still higher than 70.9% in May 2021, however.Power shortages, driven entirely by demand and not declines in supply, narrowed to 0.4% of requirements in May. This compared with 1.8% in April, an analysis of daily load despatch data from federal grid regulator POSOCO showed.Demand in the financial year to March 2023 is expected to grow at the fastest pace in at least 38 years.Utilities' coal inventories at the end of April were at their lowest levels in years, but they rose 6.3% in May to 23.3 million tonnes, helped by renewables stepping up to carry more of the national electricity load.Climate activists have blamed a delay in installation of renewable energy capacity for the April power shortfalls, the worst electricity crisis in more than six years. India, the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, is 37% short of its target for end-2022 green electricity capacity.Electricity demand in May was 23.5% higher than in the same month last year and up 11.9% on May 2019, the data showed.Wind energy generation, which typically picks up from May and tapers in August, was 51.1% higher in May than a year before, while solar power output increased 37.8%, the data showed. Generation from all renewable sources rose 44.1% from a year before, the fastest pace in at least 30 months.Analysts say the respite from power cuts in May is temporary and India's power crisis is unlikely to be resolved soon. India faced its worst power cuts in over six years in April. Officials also know very well that monsoons impact mining and transport. Yet, no preemptive action was taken to resolve this crisis,  the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said in a note last month. A lower pre-monsoon coal stock at power stations indicates the possibility of another power crisis in July-August 2022,  the CREA said.Because demand peaks during the daytime, higher generation from solar, India's main renewable energy source, is particularly important for easing the strain on an ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations. It also conserves coal for night-time generation and reduces pressure on the rail network.",

OMC operates about 280 renewable energy plants to provide electricity for telecom companies, small and medium businesses and rural houses via mini-grids, using storage batteries, in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It aims to expand its network to 5,000 power plants by 2030, the Japanese company said. Chubu Electric aims to contribute to OMC, in which Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co also has a stake, by leveraging its operation and maintenance skills for power generation, transmission and distribution, it said. Last November, the utility said it plans to make strategic investments of 1 trillion yen ($7.8 billion) over the 10 years through 2030, mainly in overseas and renewable energy, to achieve its 2030 recurring profit goal of 250 billion yen.

        "articleBody": "State-owned Gail India will invest Rs 6,000 crore in the next three years in renewables, a top official said on Monday. The investment can go up by an additional Rs 20,000 crore by 2030, GAIL India chairman and managing director Manoj Jain told reporters in Mumbai. GAIL India Director (Finance) Rakesh Kumar Jain said the company, which reported a 112 per cent jump in FY22 post-tax net profit at Rs 10,364 crore, has outlined an overall capital expenditure plan of up to Rs 40,000 crore in the next five years, which will cover a wide array of areas. This will entail borrowings of up to Rs 20,000 crore, while the rest will come from internal accruals, the director added. Its chairman said it is looking at almost 3 GW of renewables capacity by 2030, which will include 1 GW to start within the next three years. The company is undertaking a liquid hydrogen capacity addition right now and the progress done on the prototype will influence its overall investments, Manoj Jain said, adding that a call on the same will be taken after 18 months. Giving details on the same, Jain said it is in the process of procuring a 10 MW facility for liquid hydrogen, which is slated to be the largest in the country and is on the lookout for the electrolyser. In FY22, it invested Rs 7,700 crore across all activities, which included pipelines for the core transmission business and petrochemicals, he added. Meanwhile, the chairman said GAIL is awaiting a nod from the government on its asset monetisation proposals and added that it expects to monetise up to Rs 4,000 crore of assets in FY23. On the exploration and production side, its activities will be limited to an asset being pursued in neighbouring Myanmar where it is investing money, Jain added.",

        "articleBody": "In a major push to India's green energy drive, Adani Green subsidiary Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer One Limited has commissioned a 390 MW wind-solar hybrid power plant at Jaisalmer. The plant will be India's first wind and solar hybrid power generation plant. The hybrid power plant, integrated through solar and wind power generation, harnesses the full potential of renewable energy by resolving the intermittency of the generation and provides a more reliable solution to meet the rising power demand, the company said.  The new plant has a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) with tariff at Rs. 2.69 per kWh, well below the Average Power Procurement Cost (APPC) at national level, delivering access to affordable, modern, and clean energy to all,  said a statement from the company. Wind-Solar Hybrid energy is an important aspect of our business strategy which aims to meet India's growing need for green energy,  said Vneet S Jaain, MD and CEO, AGEL.  Jaain added that the commissioning of this hybrid plant is an incremental step towards meeting India's sustainable energy goals.   This project is a part of the first construction facility by international banks in Adani Green. It is commendable that the project was successfully executed amidst the uncertainties imposed by the global pandemic,  he said. With the successful commissioning of the plant, AGEL now has an operational capacity of 5.8 GW. This places AGEL's total renewable portfolio of 20.4 GW well on track to meet its vision of 45 GW capacity by 2030.",

        "articleBody": "State-owned consultancy firm Engineers India Ltd (EIL) on Saturday said it has adopted a new vision statement that aims at the company becoming a global leader offering total energy solutions.  The energy landscape in India and across the globe is changing at a swift pace and organizations across the globe are re-strategizing their business operations focused towards sustainability, climate change and energy transition,  the firm said in a statement.  EIL said since its inception it has always aligned corporate and business strategies with the energy ecosystem and aims to attain leadership position across the energy sector.   To strengthen our resolve and commitments towards futuristic goals, we at EIL, would now be driven by our new vision statement - 'To be a Global Leader offering Total Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future',  the statement said.  This new vision would steer EIL towards a growth and transition pathway, thus evolving the firm into a total energy consulting organisation with leadership position across all the pillars and constituents of the energy sector.   The Vision Statement would also motivate and drive us to strengthen our resolve and our aspirations to be global leader providing a complete range of solutions to its stakeholders across the energy sector with focus on minimizing overall carbon footprints in processes and designs,  it said.   We believe that this powerful vision statement, coupled with strong fundamentals, technical prowess and high skill sets that we possess, will further enthuse and motivate all of us at EIL to provide our niche and value added services across the energy landscape.   Established in 1965, EIL provides engineering consultancy and EPC services principally focused on the oil and gas and petrochemical industries. Last month, the firm set 2035 as the target year to achieve net zero carbon emission across its businesses.   In the rapidly changing global energy landscape, carbon intensity is becoming a key performance indicator for the success of any organization. New project investments are also diverted towards clean and green technologies instead of carbon intensive technological solutions. Hence, it has become imperative to become a net zero service provider to enhance the company's brand image,  it had said on April 29.",

        "articleBody": "Davos, India is more conscious of going for green energy than any other country in the world, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday. He said special emphasis is being given on green hydrogen, biofuel blending and exploration and production of biofuel from alternative sources.  Puri asserted that India would eventually become a leader in the green hydrogen space. The target of 20 per cent of ethanol blending has been brought forward from 2030 to 2025 and it would be definitely achieved, he said.  Puri, also Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs, said India responded quickly and effectively when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world and one of the most important decisions was to fast-track vaccine development and manufacturing on a war footing.   Whatever vaccine manufacturing capacity India had earlier, had almost got dismantled during the 2004-2014 period,  Puri said, while emphasising that one of the most important decisions taken by the Modi government after the pandemic hit the world was to ramp up the vaccine manufacturing at an unprecedented speed.  The minister said he doesn't want to sound political on this.   While we have seen pandemics before, when this Covid-19 pandemic hit us, it was more reminiscent of Spanish Flu due to the amount of destruction it caused across the world,  he said.  Speaking at a session on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2022 here, Puri also talked about various transformational changes that have happened after 2014 during the Narendra Modi government.  The breakfast session on 'Unleashing power of Indian diaspora for philanthropy, entrepreneurship and social impact', was organised by industry body CII and Indiaspora.",

        "articleBody": "BMW is exploring new investments in solar, geothermal and hydrogen energy to lower its dependence on natural gas, the carmaker's production chief told Reuters on Monday, warning an embargo on Russian gas would bring the industry to a standstill. The carmaker, which relied on natural gas for 54% of its energy consumption in 2021, is examining where it can add solar panels to its plants and developing plans with local authorities to transport hydrogen to its plant in Leipzig, Germany.  Hydrogen is very well-suited to lower or even fully compensate for gas demand,  Milan Nedeljkovic said.  Our industry accounts for around 37% of German natural gas consumption,  he said when asked what would happen to BMW's plants in the event of a halt to gas deliveries from Russia.  Not just BMW but the entire sector would come to a standstill.  BMW's plans reflect wider preparations underway across German industry to shift away from Russian gas and come up with a system to ration available supplies in the event of a sudden halt to deliveries. Beyond Germany, a new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, which BMW has said will be the world's first auto factory to run entirely without fossil fuels, will rely heavily on solar, Nedelkjovic said, adding that the carmaker was also looking into using geothermal energy. Geothermal power is more stable than weather-dependent renewables but has not seen growth or investment comparable to wind or solar partly due to high upfront costs and complex licensing processes for drilling. Asked about the potential of nuclear energy, which accounts for around half of Hungary's energy supply but is being phased out in Germany, Nedeljkovic said:  Nuclear energy can be a stabilising factor, particularly in these volatile times. For our own production we rely on regenerative energy sources. ",

        "articleBody": "India will have significant opportunities to share its renewable energy policies, expertise, experiences and products with developing countries, driving international cooperation on the energy transition during its upcoming G20 presidency, a senior executive of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said here.  India will hold the G20 presidency from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, and will convene the G20 leaders' summit in 2023 for the first time. G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation that plays an important role in global economic governance.  Binu Parthan, the head of regions at IRENA, said in Singapore on Wednesday that there will be significant opportunities for India to influence the world with its comprehensive approach to developing renewable energy in various forms.  He sees India supplying renewable energy solutions such as solar panels and related systems to other developing countries, making it easier and inexpensive from investment aspects.   India will have significant opportunities to share its renewable energy policies, expertise, experiences and products with other countries in the region and beyond,  he said. Parthan also appreciated India's format for encouraging private sector participation in renewable projects by price-based auctioning of opportunities to set up renewable energy plants in the country.   This is a very impressive and innovative approach in developing renewable energy options and these can be replicated elsewhere in the world,  he said, adding that IRENA also supports India's Green Hydrogen Mission.  In terms of market development, he sees the spillover effect of Indian manufacturers making renewable energy products, especially the solar panels and related equipment.  We hope the whole RE eco-system would help accelerate the global energy transition.   In January 2022, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy had signed a strategic partnership agreement with 167-member country IRENA, signalling its intent to further strengthen its collaboration with IRENA in the field of Renewable Energy. India installed 13 gigawatts (GW) of renewables in 2021 and has grown its capacity by over 53 GW in the last five years, positioning it as one of the fastest growing renewable energy adopters in the world.  With massive renewable energy potential, India has an aim to become a major producer of green hydrogen to support the decarbonisation of its industrial economy.  According to IRENA, hydrogen will account for around 12 per cent of total energy supply in a 1.5 degrees C compatible world by 2050.  During his visit to New Delhi last month, IRENA Director General Francesco La Camera had discussed renewable energy with Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Bhupender Singh Yadav.  Given IRENA's huge global experiences on Renewable Energy, especially on Solar Energy, Yadav had called on IRENA to play a vital role in India's efforts towards attainment of enhanced climate goals announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP 26.  Yadav had also emphasised that India's Presidency of G-20 is a golden opportunity for both India and IRENA on how renewable energy can accelerate industry transition of hard to abate sectors, but without compromising the development aspirations of the developing countries and leaving no one behind.  Parthan was in Singapore for the global launch of 15th edition of the Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) 2022 on Wednesday.SIEW 2022 will take place in Singapore from October 25 to 28, 2022.",

        "articleBody": "With electric mobility gaining traction across the world, big countries like India need a holistic strategy to be successful in meeting the end goal of combating global warming, instead of just putting  regulations and norms on the back of carmakers , according to global automotive major Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares.Various aspects, including clean energy, charging infrastructure, battery supply, mobility devices and tax revenues, need to be strategically considered to drive the strategy, he said here while addressing media in a virtual conference. This is a mobility strategy that each big country like India needs to have, a strategy (of) not only imposing regulations and norms on the back of the carmakers, that's easy. Everybody has done that,  Tavares said.Further, he said,  What is difficult is to think strategically about a 360-degree approach on energy, on infrastructure, on battery supply, on mobility devices, and even on tax revenues .He was responding to a query on what support the company expected from the government for accelerating the adoption of electric mobility.Elaborating his point, he said in most countries, the automobile sector is a big tax provider and most of those taxes are on petrol (internal combustion engine vehicles). So, the day you have less petrol and more electricity (electric vehicles), you have much less tax revenues and you have a problem with the state budget for that matter,  Tavares said.Addressing this issue in a strategic matter, he said,  ...looking at the 360-degree approach and not only about the mobility device, because the mobility device, if you just impose regulations on cars, it's the cheap version of the strategy .Asserting that such a strategy would be totally 'incomplete and limited', Tavares said even if manufacturers bring EVs they would not be affordable and consumers won't be able to buy them.Reiterating the need to have  clean energy , he said,  That's the number one driver of everything. Whatever you do in the mobility world or many other things, if you don't have clean energy, it's always going to be a challenge, including the overall efficiency of EVs .Tavares further said,  If we want to bring zero-emission mobility devices, that's not going to be the major problem but if we want to be very effective in addressing the global warming issue, make sure that the full lifecycle analysis is clean, which means we need to take care not only about the mobility device but also about the energy, we need to charge electric vehicles with clean energy .The issue of clean energy, he said, is  possibly the biggest challenge  in the world at present although the OEMs have done their fair share.Tavares also highlighted the need for having a convenient EV charging infrastructure for customers, a robust power supply network to support fast charging and the localisation of batteries.Besides, India also needs to have the ability not only to mine raw materials like lithium and nickel but also to process them to value add in order to have a holistic approach towards electric mobility, he said. So, at the end of the day, this has to be a comprehensive approach, and anything that the Indian government would like to discuss with us or learn from us, we are here to help and we are here to stay and we are here to support,  Tavares said.",

        "articleBody": "British-based power generation firm ContourGlobal on Tuesday accepted a private equity takeover rooted in demand for greener energy, amid broader market turmoil linked to the Ukraine conflict.The thermal and renewable power plant operator has agreed to a \u00a31.75-billion ($2.1-billion, 2.0-billion-euro) bid from US private equity giant KKR, it said in a statement citing decarbonisation targets. The energy transition is driving substantial changes in the underlying energy markets and, as such, will require sustained capital investment and business agility,  it added. KKR believes it can support ContourGlobal in its ... strategy which aims at a meaningful 40-percent reduction of CO2 emissions intensity by 2030, and to be net zero carbon by 2050. The London-headquartered firm owns 138 power plants in Africa, Europe, Latin America and North America.KKR will pay 263.6 pence, representing a 36-percent premium to Monday's closing price.Tuesday's news sent the group's share price rocketing by one third to 256.50 pence in late afternoon deals.ContourGlobal, founded in 2005 by US entrepreneur Joseph Brandt and US-based investment fund Reservoir Capital, floated on the London stock market in 2017. ContourGlobal's track record, business model and financial performance suggested the shares were too cheap, especially as this is a company which provides energy when the world is crying out for it,  said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. The company also ticks another important box, in that it has no plans to work on any new coal-fired projects,  added Mould, noting that one third of its output  already comes from solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy .World energy markets have surged this year on supply fears after key gas and oil producer Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February.",

India, which has an electricity trading deal with Nepal, is investing billions of dollars in infrastructure including hydropower plants, as New Delhi looks to grow its influence in its smaller neighbours, where China is also increasingly active. The Arun IV project will be jointly built on the Arun River in Nepal's east by India's Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) Ltd and Nepal's state-owned Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) owing 51% and 49% of equity respectively, NEA spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai said.  Nepal will get 152 megawatt of free electricity from the plant for its consumption and the rest will be split between the two on the 51% and 49% basis,  Bhattarai told Reuters without giving further details.  Cost of the project is being worked out and whatever it comes will be shared as per the above ratio.  The power plant agreement is among six deals concluded between India and Nepal during the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fifth visit to the Himalayan nation on Monday, India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. During the visit Modi met his Nepali counterpart Sher Bahadur Deuba and took part in a Buddhist ceremony to mark the birth anniversary of Lord Buddha at Lumbini in southwest Nepal. Indian companies are negotiating with the government for power plants that would produce a total of 8,250 MW and Nepal hopes to export excess energy to India, officials said. Nepal has the potential to produce 42,000 MW of hydropower but now generates about 1,200 MW -- less than demand of about 1,750 MW. The deficit is met by imports from India.",

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the development of the 490 MW Arun-4 hydro electric project in Nepal has been signed in Lumbini, Nepal in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister of Nepal Sher Bahadur Deuba, the company said in a statement on Monday.  SJVN Chairman and Managing Director Nand Lal Sharma said it will be the third mega project to be constructed by the company in Nepal. The construction of 900 MW Arun-3 project is in progress and the 669 MW Lower Arun project is at the survey and investigation stage.  With the MoU, signed by Sharma and Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Managing Director Kulman Ghising, SJVN has three projects with a total capacity of 2,059 MW in Nepal.  According to Sharma, SJVN is targeting to have 5,000 MW projects in Nepal by 2030.  The 490 MW, Arun-4 hydro electric project will be developed as a joint venture by SJVN and NEA, wherein the former will have the majority stake.  The project will generate around 2,100 million units of energy per annum. The estimated developmental cost of the project, which is situated in Sankhuwasabha District Province-1 of Nepal, is Rs 4,900 crore, as per the statement.  The company said the Integrated River Basin Development Approach enables optimum utilisation of manpower, infrastructure and financial resources.  This concept -- which will help in allocation of hydro projects in one single river basin to one developer -- has been accepted by the Nepal government as well as by the state governments of Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.  In addition to the three hydro projects in Nepal, SJVN is also constructing 217-km 400 kV associated transmission system for evacuation of power.   With total portfolio of around 31,500 MW, SJVN now has power projects of more than 30 GW capacity under operation and different stages of development. These recent additions of new projects are leading the company towards actualising of its shared vision of 5,000 MW by 2023; 25,000 MW by 2030 and; 50,000 MW installed capacity by 2040,  Sharma said.",

        "articleBody": "The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency on Friday said it is keen to promote more green energy projects in Odisha and has already sanctioned loans worth Rs 670 crore within one year of opening its branch in the state. The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), a public sector non-banking financial institution, has been engaged in promoting, developing and extending financial assistance for projects related to new and renewable sources of energy.  Pradip Kumar Das, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of IREDA, on Friday met Odisha chief secretary Suresh Chandra Mahapatra, a company statement said.  During the meeting Das said that the IREDA is keen to promote more renewable energy projects in Odisha, realising the immense green energy potential in the state.  In August 2021, the IREDA opened a branch office in Bhubaneswar, following which the company sanctioned five hydro power projects with total capacity of 80.5 MW and a 1.5-MW energy access project.  Following the opening of its branch office in Odisha, IREDA has sanctioned loans of Rs 670 crore and disbursed Rs 348 crore, it said.  The state chief secretary and IREDA's CMD had a positive discussion about the numerous efforts made by IREDA in the last two years and future opportunities in Odisha, the statement said, adding that opportunities for promoting the usage of Renewable Energy (RE) in the state were highlighted throughout the conversation.  According to the statement, the chief secretary praised IREDA's efforts in Odisha and assured the state government's complete support for RE development.  Das said that apart from hydro and access to energy, several projects for Odisha related to biomass and manufacturing are also under consideration.  He informed the chief secretary about the company's recent initiatives, achievements and future plans for the RE sector's expansion in line with the central government's target to have a 50 per cent share of total energy use from non-fossil fuels by 2030.  The IREDA should also encourage solar rooftop, solar heating and solar lighting systems for household use in Odisha, the chief secretary was quoted as having said in the statement.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Brookfield Asset Management-based Pipeline Infrastructure Ltd has signed a pact with state-owned GAIL for jointly developing a hydrogen-based ecosystem in India. The MoU aims at collectively exploring the feasibility, desirability and viability of hydrogen as a source of energy and thus build a partnership between the companies, official sources said.  Pipeline Infrastructure Limited (PIL) is owned by India Infrastructure Trust, an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by Brookfield Asset Management, a global leader in alternative asset management and one of the largest investors in real assets.  PIL owns and operates a 48-inch diameter, 1,480 km long Kakinada to Bharuch gas pipeline that connects major domestic supply hubs on the east to key demand centers in the west. It is a vital link in India's national gas grid.  GAIL is India's largest gas transporting and marketing company. It owns about two-thirds of truck pipelines.  Pipelines are a critical element in transporting hydrogen, a zero-carbon emitting energy source that has caught the fancy of the world.  Several Indian firms including GAIL have announced plans to make hydrogen.  Aayushi Agarwal, Assistant Vice President (Strategic Planning & New Initiatives), PIL and Ashu Singhal, Executive Director, GAIL signed the MoU in the presence of PIL CEO Akhil Mehrotra and GAIL Director (Business Development) M V Iyer.  PIL and GAIL will explore various options for transportation, using the existing natural gas pipeline and the end-use of hydrogen, they said.  India as a nation is at a very nascent stage with respect to hydrogen as an energy source. The focus at this time should be on exploring the production, transmission, and distribution of hydrogen for making it viable to be able to contribute towards fulfilling India's COP26 commitment.",

This is believed to be the first transition loan to be provided by a foreign bank to India\u2019s biofuel manufacturing industry,\u201d said the company in a release.Sunil Ranka, CFO, SRSL, said, \u201cBioethanol production is not new to India. But it holds the key for the transition of the energy sector\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, to more sustainable biofuels which have a lower carbon footprint and will lead to energy independence of the country. To provide some perspective, India has an ethanol production capacity of about 849 crore litres today. For India\u2019s targeted 20% blending of ethanol in petrol by 2025, the market will need 1,700-crore litre capacity (80% plant efficiency), and this is where we hope to contribute to the growth of the global biofuel industry by ramping up our bioethanol production capacity to contribute to achieving this ambitious but meaningful target.\u201d Niraj Mittal, Managing Director, and Country Head of Institutional Banking Group, DBS Bank India, said, \u201cTransitioning to bioethanol and other biofuels are expected to play a valuable role in the transition of the power and energy sector towards net zero. These alternative fuel mixes offer the land and marine transport industry a realisable path to achieving decarbonisation, while reducing their dependence on fossil fuels. As a bank, we are committed to financing the transition to a lower carbon future, and this latest transition loan facility with Shree Renuka Sugars reinforces our continued commitment to work alongside our like-minded partners in collective efforts to transition industries from brown to light brown and gradually to green, and work towards becoming net zero inthe coming decades.\u201d\u201cIn October 2021, DBS became the first Singapore bank to become a signatory on the United Nations-convened, industry-led Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). As a signatory, DBS commits to transition the operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net zero by 2050 or sooner,\u201d the release said.",

        "articleBody": "Global private equity investor Actis is actively considering investing in the green hydrogen segment in India, said Sanjiv Aggarwal, Sanjiv Aggarwal, Partner, Energy Infrastructure at Actis. We are studying the sector very carefully. Its an area which we are very actively considering investing in not only in India, but also in other markets,  said Aggarwal.Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolyzers. Over the past few months, several Indian companies including Reliance Industries, Renew Power, Indian Oil Corporation, Adani Group, and Greenko Group have announced plans in this segment.Actis which last month sold its renewable energy platform Sprng Energy to Shell Overseas Investment BV, for Rs 11,900 crore has also incorporated Blupine Energy Pvt Ltd, under which it is targeting $800 million to $1 billion of investments to develop renewable energy projects and store assets. Sprng was Actis Energy 4 fund investment. Bluepine is going to be our platform through which we are going to invest approx. a billion dollars in India. While in Sprng we did not have any C&I (commercial and industrial) offtakers, in Bluepine we would,  said Aggarwal, adding that Actis is also looking at new technologies like round the clock power or hybrid.  We will also selectively look at storage options. So, Bluepine\u2019s generation is going to be more technology and demand based. The market is changing and Bluepine will adapt to these markey changes. Actis has previously invested $800 million over the last seven years in Indian renewables in platforms such as Ostro Energy and Sprng Energy to build a 3 GW of solar and wind capacity. Actis sold Ostro Energy to Renew Power in 2018.In October 2021 Actis announced its latest fund, Actis Energy 5, which closed with $6 billion of investable capital towards green energy.On the current power crisis faced by India, Aggarwal said this current situation is not only in India, but a global phenomenon. It also underlines that there's a need for us to move quickly to storage.  Once the storage costs are brought down, renewables can function as a baseload capacity. There is work happening on battery technology but the costs are still high. However, I think that, at least for the next four to five years or perhaps even longer, coal will continue to be a very significant part of the energy mix in India. ",

The global drive towards green hydrogen adoption is dependent on decline in electrolysers\u2019 costs by 50% by 2030. However, the recent surge in metal prices may delay the hydrogen consumption goals.India\u2019s drive to enhance green hydrogen production could entail overall investments of Rs 4 trillion, factoring RE capacity additions of 60 GW and investments in electrolyser manufacturing facilities.According to a research carried by ICRA, 98% of the hydrogen is produced with use of fossil fuels currently (grey or blue hydrogen), however surge in fossil fuels prices has raised the levelised cost of hydrogen production by 3 - 4x, bringing it at par with that for green hydrogen ($5/kg). This, if sustained, may augur well towards a faster adoption of green hydrogen technology, it said.Rohit Ahuja, Head of Research and Outreach, ICRA says, \u201cElectrolysis is the most preferred technology of producing Green Hydrogen, however considering the recent surge in metal prices on geopolitical disruptions, the expected reduction in manufacturing costs for electrolysers may be back-ended to close to 2030, rather than in the immediate term.\u201dGreen Hydrogen share in total hydrogen production in India is expected to increase to 30%/80% (from nil) by 2030/2050, along with 4-5x increase in overall consumption to 30 mmt (from 6 mmt currently). A major shift in demand is expected towards transportation (hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) and power generation sectors and will consume around 30% of the hydrogen demand by year 2050. ",

        "articleBody": "Union power minister R K Singh on Tuesday urged German energy firms to invest in India as the country has emerged as the most attractive destination for investment in renewable energy sector.  Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy R K Singh held a virtual round-table meeting today with major German energy companies about their expansion in India,  said a statement by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE).  Union secretary for power Alok Kumar, joint secretary MNRE Vandana Kumar and other senior officials from India and Germany also joined the meeting.  Singh said that India has emerged as the most attractive destination for investment in Renewable Energy (RE).  The country has focused programmes for capacity addition and accelerating the energy transition, he added.  The minister said that India already has one of the largest RE capacities in the world, and the country has the fastest rate of growth of RE capacity addition.  Singh emphasised that India will add some of the largest capacities in battery storage, green hydrogen and green ammonia for its own use and also meet the growing global demand.  According to Singh, India will become one of the largest producers of green hydrogen in the world.  We will manufacture green hydrogen at the most competitive prices , he told the German companies, adding that the government has plans to create significant opportunities in offshore wind.   We plan to have a capacity of 30,000 MW of offshore wind in our country,  he said.  Inviting German companies to take part and compete in the manufacturing of high-efficiency solar cells and modules, Singh said India is going to set up 50,000 MW capacity and will offer  numerous emerging opportunities  for investment.  The minister said that India has a completely accessible market, facilitative policies and an enabling regulatory ecosystem.  Singh also urged Germany to source from India their requirements of green hydrogen and green ammonia on their path to energy transition.  Singh and Germany's economic affairs and climate change minister signed a joint declaration of intent on Indo-German hydrogen task force on Monday.  Under the agreement both countries will establish an Indo-German green hydrogen task force to strengthen mutual cooperation in production, utilisation, storage and distribution of green hydrogen through building enabling frameworks for projects, regulations and standards, trade, and joint research and development projects.",

        "articleBody": "The alternative fuel sector should be brought under priority sector lending according to Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.Addressing a conference on Financing electric vehicles (EVs) and the Bio-energy sector, he said, \u201cThe most apt solution for resolving the financing problems of the alternative fuel sector is to bring it under priority sector lending. I will be taking this request to the Finance Minister and the Reserve Bank of India.\u201d\u201cDoing this will reduce pollution and the import bill of the country. This sector will also help increase our exports and employment potential,\u201d he added.Gadkari also said that companies in the alternative fuel need to work together, instead of silos as they presently are, and combine efforts towards displacing petrol and diesel vehicles.Commenting on agriculture, he said that there is a need for diversification of food crops and that the sugar industry should think the most seriously about increasing ethanol production.91289758\u201cThe requirement of ethanol is so high that the present production will never be able to meet demand. The goal of 20 per cent blending of petrol with ethanol will require 1000 crore litres and I don\u2019t think we will be able to meet that requirement in the next three to four years,\u201d he said.Gadkari also said that the cost of electric vehicles can come down to below that of petrol and diesel vehicles.\u201cThose days are not too far away when the cost of an electric vehicle engine will be equal to a petrol or diesel one. The way production is going to rise in the coming days, I believe the costs will be equal. I also have a gut feeling that eventually the e-vehicles will be cheaper to make that the petrol or diesel ones,\u201d he said.Gadkari also said that the will be meeting with Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw this week. \u201cI will be urging him that diesel generators of telecom towers should be converted to run on ethanol. In my conversation with diesel generator makers, I have got to know that this conversion will lead to an additional requirement of 2000 crore litres of ethanol,\u201d he said.",

        "articleBody": "State-run power giant NTPC has invited bids from the country's startups for the production of torrefied biomass pellets.Through its research and development wing NETRA, the NTPC intends to provide a platform to startups to enable them develop an advanced technology for producing torrefied biomass pellets that are well-suited for decentralised small-scale users.The deadline for the submission of the proposals titled 'torrefied pellet manufacturing plant for agri-waste' is May 19, 2022, NTPC said in a statement.The move is expected to reinforce NTPC's commitment towards developing the biomass ecosystem in the country, and will provide a unique platform for the Indian startups to fulfill the prime minister's vision of an 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and also contribute towards the ambitious 'make in India' movement, the company said.India produces around 230 MMTA of biomass that is either wasted or burnt. Biomass co-firing (using biomass as supplementary fuel to reduce the use of coal) in power plants has proved to be a major solution to this menace, thereby reducing carbon footprints in the environment.Many of the NTPC plants have already started the requisite co-firing of biomass pellets with coal. Long-term procurement action has also been initiated for many plants.Till now, the focus has been centred on non-torrefied biomass pellets. However for bulk utilisation of biomass, torrefied biomass pellet production needs to be given importance, as torrefied biomass pellet has more energy density, and its characteristics are closer to coal.Further, torrefied biomass pellets will reduce average transportation costs.Currently, the technology for torrefied pellets is still in the nascent stage of development.The Union power ministry has set up the national mission for the use of biomass in thermal power plants (Mission SAMARTH), and mandated 5-10 per cent co-firing of biomass in all coal-fired thermal power plants in the country.In the Union Budget 2022-23, the biomass co-firing in power plants has been recognised as an important tool for carbon reduction and income generation for farmers.",

        "articleBody": "In a major boost to industry-starved Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar inaugurated on Saturday a greenfield grain-based ethanol plant built at a cost of Rs 105 crore at Purnea. The project is a part of Bihar\u2019s ambitious foray into ethanol production using sugarcane, maize and rice to meet the country\u2019s fuel needs.The ethanol plant has been built using the latest technology and will not discharge any waste, making it a zero-liquid discharge plant that is completely environment friendly. It was commissioned under the Government of India and the Bihar dispensation\u2019s ethanol promotion policies announced in 2021.The plant will buy 130 tons of rice husk and 145-150 tons of maize or rice directly from local farmers. It will generate direct employment to 52 people and create avenues of earning for hundreds of others in the area.91265109The factory will also produce 27 tons of DDGS (distiller's dried grains with solubles) as a by-product, processed from its waste, which will be sold for animal feed, and help the dairy and poultry farmers in the State.The ethanol will be exclusively sold to the Oil Marketing Companies namely Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum in the State of Bihar and neighbouring States of West Bengal and Jharkhand, for which a 10 year long term purchase agreement has been with the OMCs.Bihar\u2019s industry minister Shahnawaz Hussain told ET that the state plans to utilize its sizable maize production- three maize crops are harvested every year in the state- along with sugarcane and broken rice which is not fit for consumption. The ground water level in the state is good due to several waterbodies. Availability of labour- at a relatively cheap rate- also works to the advantage of the state.Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have signed agreements with 17 units with the approved capacity of 1080 kilo litre per day production of ethanol in the coming days. Out of these 17 units, the first will become functional on Saturday while three others are ready for production. Two of these are located in Gopalganj while one is in Bhojpur.At present, Bihar has got a quota of 36 crore liters of ethanol supply annually to Oil manufacturing companies. But as per the availability of raw materials and water for ethanol production, Bihar's ethanol production capacity is 172 crore liters per annum, considering the proposals for investment and other favorable conditions.",

Union Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Rameswar Teli launched the M15 petrol in the presence of Niti Aayog member VK Saraswat and IOC chairman SM Vaidya on Saturday. Teli said that blending fuel with methanol will provide respite from the rising prices.  Pilot rollout of M15 is a stepping stone towards achieving fuel independence and reducing the import burden,  he said. Steps are being taken by IOC to make India self-sufficient in energy, he added. The pilot rollout was done in Tinsukia by the company due to the ready availability of methanol, which is being manufactured by Assam Petrochemical Ltd in the vicinity of Digboi refinery, said an official statement.",

        "articleBody": "Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Friday said his dream as Transport Minister is diversification of automobile industry towards ethanol, methanol, green hydrogen and others.  So, today, the most important, which I request you, you should think 50 years ahead. Presently, we have petrol and diesel cars. As Transport Minister, my dream is diversification of automobile industry towards ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, bioCNG,...and green hydrogen,  he said, addressing an event organised by the FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO) in Hyderabad. He spoke highly of green hydrogen, describing it as a major fuel in the future.  I was just telling chamber of commerce people, who met me, that green hydrogen is the future. Now, you can make green hydrogen not only from water, but you can make green hydrogen from organic waste,  he said.  Our dream is to export green hydrogen to the world,  he said. On March 30, Gadkari rode in his new hydrogen-based electric car to Parliament. Green hydrogen is generated from water and a vehicle runs on the same. The government is also working towards producing hydrogen from organic waste, Gadkari had said then while noting green hydrogen is cheaper than petrol. Gadkari has been pushing for the use of alternative fuel-powered vehicles. Earlier, he inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of 12 National Highway (NH) projects and 7 CRIF (central road infrastructure fund) projects at an event near the international airport on the city outskirts. The NH projects of a total length 460 KM with an investment of Rs 8,000 crore would boost the inter- State connectivity by enabling seamless travel from Telangana to Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, he said on a social media platform. Addressing a gathering after the inauguration of the projects, he said the national highway network in Telangana has been expanded from 2,511 kms in 2014 to 4,996 kms till March 2022. In the last eight years, the NH network has been enhanced by 2,485 km. He assured that it would further be increased in the future.  I am happy today in Telangana two projects were inaugurated and the foundation stone has been laid for 17 projects. Whatever has been done is just only a trailer, the actual film is yet to start,  the Union Minister said. The Union Minister said out of 33 districts in Telangana, 32 have already been linked with NH network and remaining one district would be connected soon. He said the National Highway infrastructure would be improved in Telangana by spending Rs three lakh crore between 2014 and 2024. It would be of the standard of the United States. He said five out of the 26 green express highways being built in the country would be passing through Telangana. Observing that Hyderabad was a major IT hub and engine of the country's economic growth, he said the prosperity of Telangana would lead to progress of the nation. Gadkari further said to make an 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and achieving the Prime Minister's dream of making India a USD 5-trillion economy, Telangana has also to be made prosperous and rich.  I assure to fulfil this dream, international standard road infrastructure will be done in Telangana. I promise road infrastructure in the State will be equivalent to America before the end of 2024,  he said. The Union Minister said construction of roads would ensure progress, development, employment, poverty eradication and welfare of farmers. Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways and Civil Aviation V K Singh, Union Minister of Tourism G Kishan Reddy and Telangana Minister for Roads and Buildings Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy also spoke. Meanwhile, Prashant Reddy, in a release, took exception to alleged BJP activists raising slogans when he began to speak at the event. Those who raised slogans when Prashant Reddy spoke calmed down after Kishan Reddy asked them not to cause such disturbance.",

        "articleBody": "India needs around $60 billion to achieve its 450 GW renewable target by 2030, according to Prateek Jhawar, Executive Director-Investment Banking & Head, Infrastructure and Real Assets, Avendus Capital Private Ltd. The good news, however, is that there is no dearth of capital and India's renewable story is finding favour with international investors who are ready to deploy large capital in the country.  Renewable energy is the preferred investment segment for international investors from two perspectives: the overall mandate for these investors is turning towards sustainability, which renewable energy qualifies for and for the infrastructure investment asset class, the biggest quantum of requirement is coming from renewables. Other alternative sectors are not consuming as much capital at this point in time,  Jhawar told ET, adding that large corporates have started to realise this shift in mandate from investors.  They will continue to feel pressure on the treasury and the cost of financing, which is pushing them to align themselves with the sustainability goals,  added Jhawar.Over the past year, more than a dozen companies have vowed to transform their legacy businesses into sustainable, circular, and net-zero. These include petrochemical giants like RIL, metals and mining major like Vedanta, power major JSW Energy and banking bellwether HDFC among others.At the COP26 meet in Glasgow, India set a target to cut its net carbon emissions to zero by 2070. The country ranks a lowly 120 among 165 countries in its progress towards achieving all 17 sustainable development goals, lower than SAARC counterparts Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh.According to John Graham, president and chief executive officer of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), as the global economy moves towards carbon-neutral goals, it presents a  generational investment opportunity . With total assets worth $500 billion in its kitty and $15.50 billion in India, CPPIB expects its net-zero transition assets portfolio to double by 2030. One of the key challenges that conventional energy sources are facing is that the newer money foresees exit issues in the future,  said an industry expert.",

        "articleBody": "Researchers at Gujarat Biotechnology University (GBU) are developing technologies to produce carbon-free fuel which can eventually reduce carbon emissions and contribute towards a green environment, according to officials.With the vision of making a  green process concept , the research group is working on  whole-cell bio-catalysis  (WCB) for the synthesis of green fuels and biopolymers. The team claimed that the process is not only low-cost but also easily scalable on industrial size.The university has been established in partnership with University of Edinburgh (UoE), United Kingdom, by the Department of Science and Technology, Gujarat.The progress of industrialisation and exponential growth in global usage of petroleum-based hydrocarbons has elevated the global carbon footprint. The researchers of the newly established institute are working towards reducing carbon emissions.The research has been published in several reputed peer-reviewed journals including Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining (Biofpr) and Chemical Engineering Technology besides a book titled  Whole-Cell Biocatalysis: Next-generation Workhouse for Green Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals, Chemicals, and Biofuels . Carbon burden (is) a major concern currently threatening future human sustenance and creating green technology with carbon-free alternative fuels is the only way out... and WCB is a promising platform to achieve this mission,  Sudheer Pamidimarri, associate professor, GBU, told PTI. The project started late in the year 2019, we got a few leads working with modern 'omics' tools and (are) now getting ready to work on bench to execute the idea. In this work, we are going to implement novel metabolic-flux engineering tools for the first time to establish WCB to generate carbon-free fuels such as Bio-H2. The targeted timeline of achieving this task on laboratory scale is by 2024. Further planning will be done for industrial scale-up,  he added.The  Synthesis of Green Fuels  (Bio-H2) project is being funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India. The synthesis of biopolymers (Di-acids, PHBs and amines, among others) using waste biomass will be a future focus of this research group.With the concept of  whole-cell biocatalysis , the research group has developed a model that would reduce the cost of the process by at least 50-fold and have a promising application in industrial scale-up.The research group is also looking to engineer the whole-cell system to synthesize the Bio-H2 fuel from crude glycerol and lignocellulosic biomass-derived sugars.",

        "articleBody": "By the end of this decade hydrogen and related ecosystems will create a $10bn value for Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and account for nearly 10% of RIL\u2019s earnings as the company invests nearly $4-5 bn in new energy businesses, said global brokerage Morgan Stanley in a report.The brokerage firm has upgraded RIL's target price by 20% to Rs 3,253 a share, reiterating its overweight rating on the stock. RIL's shares hit a 52 week high on Thursday at Rs 2765.50, up 1.73%. We expect up to a 10% boost to RIL's NAV (net asset value) in anticipation of quicker hydrogen monetization. We estimate hydrogen can achieve a 14-15% ROCE (return on capital employed) for RIL. As the green hydrogen ecosystem is rolled out, it will also raise demand for RIL's solar panels,  said Morgan Stanley in a report dated 20 April.RIL plans will make it among the most integrated green hydrogen players globally.Over the past few months, RIL has acquired REC solar- for growing in house solar panel manufacturing and got capabilities in energy storage India with ownership/stakes in Ambri (liquid metal technology), Lithium Werks (LFP) and Faradion (Sodium Ion technology).The brokerage explained that RIL's solar panel capacity once developed can be leveraged internally to not only power its refining and chemicals complex, but help production of hydrogen considering its proximity to the sea and existing water management infrastructure at Jamnagar. RIL would then integrate this with its own electrolyzer manufacturing in partnership with Stiesdal and use the green hydrogen output internally as well for manufacturing green chemicals and fertilizers.RIL also plans to export green hydrogen to key markets where it supplies gasoline and diesel, especially countries like Singapore, which will have the highest carbon tax in Asia by 2030 at S$80/ton. It can also supply green hydrogen to its telecom towers and existing KG gas consumers, as well as to the industrial belt of Gujarat via the East-West Pipeline, with which it hastake-or-pay contracts. Its green hydrogen manufacturing will also be complemented by the existing blue hydrogen infrastructure that gasifiers will be providing (including carbon capture) RIL\u2019s plan for setting up 5,500 retail fueling outlets is key to helping it accelerate adoption of green hydrogen, especially considering the presence along highways of H2-blended CNG for trucks and long-distancebuses,  Morgan Stanley added.Through government policy support via production-linked incentives (PLI), the investment cost for solarpanel manufacturing to electrolyzers would be 15-20% lower than global peers.RIL has hived off petcoke gasifiers into a separate subsidiary with a tolling model approach to converting petcoke and coal as inputs into higher value-added syngas, hydrogen, and CO2, which can be used in downstream chemical manufacturing. This is similar to business models of industrial gas companies like Linde and Air Liquide.The contribution of renewables and gas will move from 23% in 2021 to about 40% of India's energy consumption by 2030.",

        "articleBody": "Global industrial gases company Linde, which was in the news last year for helping Indian authorities combat an acute shortage of medical oxygen, is now being talked about for its work on another gas \u2013 hydrogen. The UK-headquartered company is looking at investments of around $5 billion in hydrogen capacities around the world over the next three years, some of which could be in India. \u201cMy limit to invest in India is limitless,\u201d Sanjiv Lamba, the newly appointed CEO of Linde, has said. In an interview to ET\u2019s Nehal Chaliawala and Satish John, Lamba also said that while the Indian government\u2019s efforts to champion green hydrogen are in the right direction, an inflection point where the clean-burning industrial fuel will make a commercial case is still five to seven years away. Edited excerpts:The world is betting on hydrogen as the fuel of the future. How is Linde placed in this race?One of the lesser-known facts is that Linde today has a $2.5-billion hydrogen business. We have about 1,000 miles of pipeline and just under 200 major hydrogen plants in the world. And we operate some of the most complex fulfilment processes around handling hydrogen. Hydrogen gets talked about in multiple colours. There's grey, blue, green, yellow and turquoise and apparently pink too; I've lost count. It is, of course, a colourless gas that most people forget. The people who talk about hydrogen today, the announcements that you see, 90% of those people have never dealt with the gas. It's a molecule that requires some safety precautions and measures to be in place. And we\u2019ve been doing that for 50 years. That expertise and experience we have, you cannot replicate it, you cannot build it up in a flash.We have the ability to participate in the entire value chain of hydrogen. We can produce it using a steam methane reformer, an autothermal reformer, a box unit, and, obviously, green hydrogen using electrolysis. We have a stake in ITM Power, one of the leading players on electrolysis. We are agnostic in many ways to the technology for production. We are also able to then move that asset because of our own technologies. And then, at the point of use, we have either industrial application technology or the best hydrogen refuelling stations in the world. Our refuelling stations are based on German technology. We\u2019ve been working on it for 20 years, and today there are 2,200 installed stations across the world.What kind of investment will you be making in the hydrogen space?At the moment, we are actively working on about 288 projects. That is about $5 billion of probability-weighted investments in the next three years. If I looked at the total landscape of projects, they\u2019re probably anywhere between $20-25 billion. Linde has a phenomenally strong balance sheet. We have the ability to invest anywhere between $1-20 billion; I don't think that would be a constraint for us. The constraint is not capital, but economic feasibility. Our principle is that for projects to sustain longer-term economically, they need to stand on their own feet. The only minor variation we make is allowing incentives to be included in the financial evaluation of the project. Other than that, each hydrogen project needs to meet the same investment criteria we have as a traditional project. We don't give it a pass. Because, if it does not stand on its feet economically, it will not last long term.What kind of investments will you be making in India?I mentioned the 288 projects we are working on. Of that, some are in India but not as much as I\u2019d like. I also have to give the Indian government credit for creating the hydrogen mission policy. It is a policy of intent at the moment. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enforceability just yet. I think one major step would be changing the policy where consumption obligation would be mandated on certain industries. I know there's also a lot of discussion on production-linked incentives.My willingness to invest in India in good green projects is without limit. So, out of the $5 billion, if potentially I have to invest $5 billion in India to grow the business because opportunities are here, I would be more than happy to do that.What are the economics like for green hydrogen today?I've heard projections like $1 per kg for green hydrogen. On an Excel spreadsheet, even I can make the assumptions and deliver any number you want. None of these electrolysis plants have been operated for more than a few months. We are one of the first operators of 10 electrolysers in Australia. We are building the largest PEM electrolysis plant in Leuna in Germany at 24 megawatts, which is minuscule. People are talking about gigawatt projects, but they haven\u2019t got a megawatt on the ground. Earlier on, I used to look at this long list of announcements every day and I used to get frustrated. Now I see 98% of those announcements go nowhere. And if the largest PEM electrolyser today is being built by us, and it\u2019s only 24 megawatts, you can understand what is really happening. So, the reality is cost-effective green hydrogen production is probably five to seven years away. I wish it was sooner. I'm a champion for green hydrogen. But I have to also face reality.The Indian government wants the country to be a hydrogen exporter like the Middles East is today for crude oil. Is that a realistic ambition?I think the ambition is right. I applaud the Indian government for having this aspiration. It is driving entrepreneurs and companies to move in that direction. We also have to look at the competitive advantage India has from cheap renewable energy. There are two parts to green hydrogen pricing. The first is the capital that goes in, and the rest is renewable energy which is about 40-45% of the cost base. There is an intrinsic advantage that India enjoys in terms of its ability to leverage its low-cost renewable energy from solar power and wind power.The government also wants to boost domestic steel production. Do you see that as an opportunity for Linde?We certainly see that as a remarkable opportunity for the steel industry and for us as enablers. We play a small but critical role: without oxygen, you can't produce steel. I have said to the team that I want them to be ambitious about their profitable growth plans. I emphasise on profitable growth because sometimes in all the excitement of growth, we may not always get the best quality projects. We are very rigorous in our approach to the quality of the projects. Steel is a good industry. The quality of customers we deal with \u2013 Tata Steel, Jindals, SAIL, etc. \u2013 are good customers. Therefore, India will get a lot of support from me. I\u2019d be willing to invest in as many high-quality projects as they can bring with no constraints. I\u2019m open to investing in India as many projects as can be developed and won.Are government subsidies essential to promote the adoption of green hydrogen?My view is that incentives are absolutely essential upfront; there is no question about it. The nature of the incentives could be different. Some countries offer investment incentives, some countries offer production-linked incentives. It is absolutely essential because there is no scale for hydrogen production today on the green side.Can hydrogen be an alternative fuel for vehicles?I\u2019ll be upfront and tell you that hydrogen works best when you have a heavy payload to consider. Like a truck, bus, train or ferry. Hydrogen makes no sense in a passenger car. I mean, it\u2019s very glamorous and sounds nice. But from an economics point of view, where you have to move large payloads over long distances, that's where hydrogen is the best choice.What are your views on blue hydrogen?People don\u2019t tend to talk much about blue hydrogen today. But the reality is that blue hydrogen, which is basically hydrogen that is produced using natural gas, has very low carbon intensity. You can capture 95% of all the CO2 and sequester it. And you can do that at scale today. All the countries that have natural gas resources, like Canada, the US, Middle East nations, and Australia are going down the path to blue hydrogen. I think it's the right bridge to have between now and the end of this decade to an ultimate point of inflection where green hydrogen will take over. Today, the amount of land that blue hydrogen needs for 900 megawatts is 12 acres of land. For an equivalent PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolysis and solar energy-based project, it needs 6,100 acres of land.",

This certificate will enhance our capability to cater to international markets across Europe, America and Asia region for the supply of Green Ammonia. We have already started work on the Oman plant and are on track to commission the world\u2019s first large-scale green ammonia project. Green accreditation from leading agencies such as T\u00dcV Rheinland is an important milestone in our efforts.\u201dLast month, ACME Group signed an agreement with Norway-based Scatec ASA to invest in its Oman Project with a 50-50 joint venture, to design, develop, build, and operate a large-scale green ammonia facility in Oman.The first phase of the facility is expected to produce 100,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually and will be expanded to 1.2 million tonnes per annum with about 3.5 GW of electrolyser capacity, which will be powered by 5.5 GWp of the solar PV plant. The facility will be located in the Duqm Special Economic Zone of Oman. Potentially, the facility can be further expanded in later phases at the same location.ACME is in advanced discussions with off-takers for 20\u201325-year contracts which will lay the foundation for financing of the project.

The project is to be located in the vicinity of the Fatehgarh-III substation of the interstate transmission system in Rajasthan. The project will be set up on a build-own-operate basis, with the developer being responsible for securing connectivity and necessary permissions. Land will be provided by the central transmission utility on a right-to-use basis. The developer has to make storage capacity available for two operational cycles per day, or two complete charge-discharge cycles a day.SECI will offtake 60% capacity for third-party leasing, while 30% will be earmarked by northern and national grid operators for their ancillary services. But industry representatives said the project\u2019s success will depend on viability gap funding from the Centre, especially since 500% increase in lithium prices has made batteries expensive and will push up power tariff unviable for entities\u2019 leasing capacity.But the ministry statement said the project is aimed at providing support for developing a market in the energy storage domain. Currently, India is considered a low-priority market by global battery makers, who are focusing on the US and Europe that are focused on storage-based renewable energy projects.However, industry representatives said the timing may not be ideal because of the uncertain geopolitical situation in east Europe, which has effected global trade and jacked up commodity prices.The government has set a target of 4,000MWh of battery storage capacity as part of the plan to increase penetration of renewable energy in the national grid. A Central Electricity Authority report on optimal generation capacity mix envisages a battery storage capacity of 27,000MW, or 108,000MWh \u2014 essentially four-hour storage \u2014 by 2029-30.",

        "articleBody": "BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, is leading a \u20b94,000 crore ($525 million) investment in the Tata Group's renewables unit, joining hands with Mubadala Investment Co. of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).BlackRock Real Assets and Mubadala will together own about 10% in Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd (TPREL) and help India's largest conglomerate to expand its foray into clean energy. The final shareholding will range from 9.76% to 11.43% after conversion. The transaction values the company at about \u20b940,000 crore, a little less than half of Tata Power's market cap of \u20b987,248.75 crore.The Tata Power board has approved a plan to bring all its renewable energy businesses under the TPREL umbrella. It will consist of five units - utility scale solar, wind and hybrid generation assets; solar cell and module manufacturing; engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracting; rooftop solar infrastructure; and solar pumps and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday.ET was the first to report, on November 2, about Tata Power negotiating with Larry Fink-led BlackRock, nearly six months after pulling out of talks with Malaysian state-owned energy giant Petronas for a potential investment. This collaboration will support us to pursue exciting opportunities that lie ahead in the coming decades,  said Tata Power CEO and managing director Praveer Sinha.TPREL is among the larger renewable energy companies in India with vertically integrated operations of approximately 4.9 GW of renewable energy assets. Over the next five years, it aims to expand its portfolio fourfold to over 20 GW of renewable assets and achieve a market-leading position in the rooftop and electric vehicle charging space across India. First Round by June The company plans to phase out coal-based capacity and expand its clean and green capacity to 80% by FY30. Tata Power Renewable is at the forefront of India's ambition to secure greater energy stability for its citizens while positioning its economy for a low carbon future,  said Anne Valentine Andrews, BlackRock's global head of real assets.  India's success in transitioning its energy economy will be crucial to the world's ability to meet its climate goals.  The firm manages $9.6 trillion in assets worldwide.90856071The money will fund TPREL's equity needs for at least two years, said Tata Power CFO Sanjeev Churiwala on a conference call. The first round of capital infusion is expected to be completed by June and the rest by December. TPREL said its broad-based portfolio of assets ensures diversified yet stable revenue sources, including 25-year, fixed-price, power purchase agreements (PPAs) for grid-connected utility scale projects. India, the world's third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, has set itself a target to be net carbon zero by 2070,  said a renewable energy consultant.  This includes more than quadrupling its renewable power generation capacity to 450 GW by 2030, including 280 GW of solar. So, funds not only from the Middle East but also from North America and Europe are finding India's renewable energy story attractive even as it is nascent. Moelis and JP Morgan were advisors to the deal.The Tata Power stock has risen 18% in the past month, closing at \u20b9273.05, down 0.80%, on Wednesday. On April 8, three Adani Group companies raised $2 billion (\u20b915,400 crore) from Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Co (IHC), to fund their growth and expansion plans.Separately, BlackRock said on Thursday that by 2030 at least three quarters of its investments will be tied to issuers targeting to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, up from 25% currently. It's the first time that BlackRock has said what its portfolio could look like in 2030 as far as emissions are concerned, but it remains an expectation rather than a firm target.",

        "articleBody": "The country needs a strong action plan to reskill coal mine workers in order to protect their interests while making a transition from conventional fuel to renewable energy usage, a report said on Thursday. India's power sector is one of the most diversified ones in the world. The country's thermal power generation by coal accounts for 62 per cent of its total generation capacity, a joint report of EY, SED Fund and FICCI said.  It also noted that India has been consistently working at a global level to reduce emission intensity to attain its net-zero target for 2070.   For the transition from conventional to clean fuel-based energy generation, it will be imperative to protect the interests of coal mine workers through a holistic approach, and a strong skill action plan is needed to transition from coal to renewable energy,  said the report titled as 'Skill action plan to fuel transition from coal to renewable energy in India'.  Somesh Kumar, Partner and Leader, Power & Utilities, EY India, said while the 'just transition' theme in the Indian context is an evolving one, it is of utmost importance to plan this evolution in a strategic manner to have a smooth transition, especially for the workforce involved across the value chains of these fossil fuels.  According to the report, coal mines create over 7.25 lakh direct jobs and many more indirect jobs. With the phasing out of old coal plants and shutting down of mines, thousands of coal mine workers are at risk of disruption in livelihood in states like West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Maharashtra.   Most of them are blue-collared workers who need to be upskilled with the newer skills of the hour. Apart from the direct workers, the entire economy of mining districts revolves around coal-related activities, and communities have relied on it for generations,  it said.  Amit Vatsyayan, Partner and Leader (Social & Skills sector), Government and Public Sector, EY India, said that skills and entrepreneurship development will play a key role in the just transition of coal mine workers.   The report focuses on the development of a replicable 'just transition' framework which can be used by districts or states to ensure that livelihood disruption of the impacted coal mine workers is minimised, and ample opportunities are provided to them. Only when the interests of the poorest and most economically vulnerable are protected, the transition may be termed as just transition,  Vatsyayan said.  Vipul Tuli, FICCI Power Committee chairman and CEO-South Asia, Sembcorp Industries, said the action plan and cost of reskilling, redeploying and rehabilitating workers from the coal sector assumes importance at a national and multilateral levels as part of India's just energy transition.",

The two 100 megawatt (MW) renewable energy plants are planned for Gauteng and the Western Cape provinces and are intended to supply existing facilities within the company, the steelmaker said.  This is an important step in our decarbonisation journey and takes advantage of the changes to legislation announced by the South African government last year, which allow private investors to build their own power plants with up to 100 megawatts of generating capacity without requiring a licence,  Chief Executive Kobus Verster said in a statement. Regular power outages implemented by state power utility Eskom have hampered business operations of many industrial companies, holding back South African economic growth. ArcelorMittal South Africa, the biggest steel producer in Africa, also said it would publish its decarbonisation roadmap by the third quarter of this year. The company expects to benefit from the projects by early 2025, subject to the outcome of the feasibility studies.",

        "articleBody": "Prices for wind and solar power in major global markets have climbed nearly 30% in a year as developers have struggled with chaotic supply chains and surging costs for everything from shipping to parts to labor, according to a report published on Wednesday. Contract prices for renewables jumped 28.5% in North America and 27.5% in Europe in the last year, according to a quarterly index by LevelTen Energy that tracks the deals, known in the industry as power purchase agreements (PPAs). In the first quarter alone, prices rose 9.7% in North America and 8.6% in Europe, LevelTen said. Economic, logistical and labor market disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic have worsened since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reversing a decade of cost declines for the renewable energy sector. There is a risk higher costs could slow demand growth at a time when the United Nations has called for clean energy to expand more rapidly to avoid the worst effects of a warming climate.  We still need keep the foot on the gas here,  Rob Collier, vice president of LevelTen's energy marketplace, said in an interview. Aggravating challenges in North America, the sector is uncertain whether U.S. lawmakers will extend tax breaks for renewable energy facilities, part of President Joe Biden's climate change agenda. Developers also are worried about a U.S. Commerce Department investigation initiated this year that could result in tariffs on solar panel imports from Asia, pushing up costs.  There's just intractable problems right now with our supply chain,  Reagan Farr, chief executive of U.S. solar developer Silicon Ranch, said in an interview. In Europe, the war in Ukraine has led governments to try to reduce dependence on natural gas from Russia, further boosting robust demand for renewables. The war has been  the last straw for a market where there was already a lot of price tension,  Oscar Perez, a partner at Spain-based fund manager and renewable energy developer Q-Energy, said in an interview. Higher costs for renewables in Europe, along with the continent's aggressive climate policies, should boost the appeal of pricier technologies like green hydrogen and biofuels, according to Raymond James analyst Graham Price.90812845 For now, soaring prices have not slowed demand, LevelTen said. In a poll the company conducted of 21 sustainability and energy advisers, 75% said their clients have accelerated or maintained procurement plans, according to the report.  It's not about demand,  Luigi Sacco, head of PPA origination at Milan-based Falck Renewables, said.  Demand is there but supply is struggling a bit in several markets.  One factor luring buyers to renewables is the soaring cost of fossil fuels.  The ready alternative to renewable generation right now is gas, and gas prices are up 100% as well,  Farr said.  So you pick your poison.  (Reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles and Isla Binnie in Madrid; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "articleBody": "Three months after teaming up, Greenko Group and Belgium\u2019s John Cockerill has finalised the terms of a 50:50 joint venture to set up a two akaline electrolyzer factories of a gigawatt each in India over the next 12 to 18 months to make the lowest cost hydrogen in the country for industrial users. The facility, likely to come up on the east coast with a planned $500 million investment, as per people in the know, will be one of the world's largest, and the largest till date outside of China. Greenko ZeroC (GZC), a subsidiary of Greenko Group and Jon Cockerill, a leading designer and manufacturer of high-capacity alkaline electrolyzers signed the agreement on Monday, both companies said in a joint statement. The 2 GW units can potentially help replacing 8% of India\u2019s annual liquified natural gas (LNG) imports.India currently imports 55% of its natural gas requirements from countries like Qatar, Australia and 85% of its total oil requirements. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven up fuel and food prices all over the world \u2013 Brent crude prices sky rocketed to above $130 barrel while price of LNG in the spot market jumped from $6 per million metric British thermal unit (mmbtu) in January 2021 to $30-38 range, breaking previous highs of $22 per mmbtu. For a major fuel importer like India, these initiatives in energy transition has bigger energy security implications and long term price stability. \u201cGreenko is working towards re-industrialization solutions for a low-carbon economy. We are partnering with a world-class technology partner in John Cockerill and will jointly develop large-scale green molecule projects in India, which will accelerate the creation of a hydrogen economy,\u201d said Anil Chalamalasetty, Greenko\u2019s CEO & MD.   90786832Greenko plans to use its 50GW/hr pumped hydro energy storage capacity coming up in Andhra Pradesh to provide firm, reliable 24x7 green power and overcome the intermittent nature of wind and solar power generation. The gigafactories will supply electrolysers to Greenko\u2019s 4 million tonnes of 1 million tonne per year green ammonia plant aimed to cater to the fertiliser sector, and to other green hydrogen facilities of industrial users like refineries or chemical complexes. The Gigafactory will include the full manufacturing electrolyser value chain including state of the art nickel coating and will produce electrolysers delivering H2 at 30 bars at the outlet at the highest purity level, the firms said in their joint statement on Monday.Hyderabad based Greenko is backed by GIC Holdings of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Japan\u2019s ORIX Corp. It is the largest footprint of operating renewable assets across 15 states with a total capacity of 7.3 GWs.\u201cThe fight against climate change is part of our mission, and this partnership with Greenko will enable us to contribute to India\u2019s sub-continent emergence as a new green energy hub,\u201d said Raphael Tilot, CEO Renewables, John Cockerill. \u201cIndia and neighbouring countries have abundant natural resources, a large domestic market and the potential to cater to the growth of this market regionally and globally.\u201dGreen hydrogen is defined as hydrogen produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyzer which in turn is powered by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. This is different from both grey and blue hydrogen. Grey hydrogen is usually produced from methane split with steam into carbon \u2013 the main culprit for climate change \u2013 and hydrogen while the process to make blue hydrogen is similar to that of grey but it needs additional technologies necessary to capture the CO2 produced when hydrogen is split from methane or from coal and stored for long term.According to a report by TERI, in 2020, India\u2019s hydrogen demand stood at 6 million tonnes per year but is expected to see a 5 fold jump to 28 MT by 2050, and almost double the current levels by 2030. 80 per cent of the demand is expected to be green in nature with users like refining and fertiliser sectors being the two largest user groups which are currently relying on grey hydrogen produced fromfossil fuels such as natural gas or naphtha. Prices too are expected to halve in the next decade. Sensing the business opportunity, large Indian corporations like Adani Group, Reliance Industries, are firming up their hydrogen strategy.",

        "articleBody": "Reliance Industries Ltd's strong cash flow generation in the 'best in class' old energy business can fund the capex of the new energy business and in turn drive one of the fastest and most profitable net-zero transitions by 2035 amongst large energy companies, Goldman Sachs has said.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani in 2020 set a 2035 target for Reliance, which operates the world's largest single-location oil refining complex and also has an array of petrochemical units, to turn net carbon zero by 2035.The company has already spent USD 1.5 billion in acquisitions to lay grounds for its new energy forays that include solar, battery and hydrogen. The carbon savings on these are to offset emissions from oil and chemical businesses.In an April 10 note, Goldman Sachs said Reliance is adopting a manufacturing approach to net zero emissions with a hyper integrated model spanning solar, battery and hydrogen and a focus on a net-zero supply chain. RIL's energy business is best in class, in our view, with the highest complexity globally and the lowest cost structure driving stable and higher margin capture versus peers,  it said.This helps the firm to earn higher refining margins over the industry benchmark. Alongside refining, we also expect (oil and gas) exploration and production (E&P) to drive the next leg of growth for the energy segment, as we estimate E&P EBITDA of USD 2-2.6 billion in FY23/24 versus USD 35 million in FY21 driven by rising domestic gas production and more than doubling of domestic gas prices,  it said.While for petchem, margins are expected to trough in the current quarter and a recovery ahead led by economic run cuts from higher-cost North Asia crackers and likely underperformance of ethane prices to oil prices. We believe RIL's investment in new energy can be fully funded by internal cash generation from their old energy business (oil-to-chemical) and in turn, could drive one of the fastest net-zero target (2035) amongst large energy value chain companies,  Goldman said.It forecast EBITDA and free-cash-flow generation of USD 35 billion and USD 14 billion respectively over FY22 to FY24 from RIL's old energy business as compared to USD 10 billion capex announced for New Energy.On its new energy strategy, the brokerage said RIL is planning to manufacture polysilicon, wafers, cells, modules, EV and grid storage batteries, elelctrolyzer, and fuel cells. We see RIL as India's largest greenabler with the company's total projected outlay of USD 10 billion over the next three years. RIL has already spent USD 1.5 billion to acquire technologies across the solar battery and hydrogen ecosystems,  it said.It saw significant expansion in the market for solar, battery and hydrogen manufacturing globally as well as in India and expected RIL to generate EBITDA of USD 3.6-12.2 billion by FY30 & FY40. We value RIL's new energy segment at USD 30/48 billion in our base and bull case respectively,  it said.  The hyper integrated model can position RIL as one of the lowest cost green hydrogen producers with RIL targeting costs at around USD 1 per kg by end of this decade. For consumer-facing businesses of Reliance, Goldman Sachs forecast a compounded annual growth rate of 29 per cent in EBITDA for telecom between FY22-25 and a 43 per cent rise in retail EBITDA. While RIL is already the market leader in the telecom business, we expect market share wins to compound rising penetration for organized retail and e-commerce business. We believe RIL's existing dominance in telecom and offline retail, combined with its partnership and the online traffic dominance of Facebook, can create the fastest-growing internet platform in India,  it said.Within e-commerce, it forecast RIL's online GMV will reach USD 35 billion in FY25 with a 31 per cent market share.

        "articleBody": "A flurry of summits this week across Dubai addressed the threat of climate change, or at least acknowledged that a pivot away from fossil fuels toward cleaner sources of power is needed to keep temperatures from rising. The glaring fault lines, however, lie on when and how to achieve this. For fossil fuel producers, like the United Arab Emirates, which hosted the gatherings, more investments, not less, are needed in oil and gas.  We definitely at this time need to include all available resources,  UAE Minister of Energy, Suhail al-Mazrouei, said at an energy forum in Dubai.  We cannot ignore or say we are going to abandon certain production. It's just not the right time, whatever reason you have,  he said, adding that doing so would make prices too high for millions around the world. It was a drumbeat echoed throughout the week in Dubai, reflecting the prominent voice fossil fuel producers are seeking to have in the global climate change conversation. It rang out at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum, the World Government Summit and a UAE-sponsored climate week in partnership with the United Nations. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo said that in the upcoming UN climate talks, known as COP27, in Egypt and next year's COP28 in the UAE, producers can address issues around  inclusiveness to ensure no sector is left behind, to address the issue of investment in the industry and to reassess the conversation.  He said limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) and the role of oil and gas  are not mutually exclusive.  That amount of warming compared to pre-industrial times is a benchmark and scientists say warming beyond it will expose people worldwide to far more extremes. To drive home the argument, proponents of more fossil fuel investments pointed repeatedly to current high oil and gas prices as reminders of the global demand for oil. There was near derision at times that countries like the United States, the UK and others are calling for fossil fuel use to ramp down in the long term but also pleading for more oil to bring down prices for consumers. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other international bodies have said that to address climate change there should not be new investments in fossil fuel infrastructure and that the fuels, which are mostly responsible for climate change, must phase out over time. That was reiterated in a 350-page report this week by The International Renewable Energy Agency that said the world must take  radical action  by investing USD 5.7 trillion each year through 2030 to shift away from fossil fuels. IRENA, which happens to be headquartered in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, said investments of $700 billion should be diverted away from the fossil fuel sector each year.  The energy transition is far from being on track and anything short of radical action in the coming years will diminish, even eliminate, chances to meet our climate goals,  said Francesco La Camera, the director-general of IRENA, when the report came out. OPEC, weighted by Saudi Arabia, projects that more oil will be needed through 2040 and beyond, particularly in Asia. Brent crude stands at USD 105 a barrel, the highest in eight years. The prices are not only good for the oil-driven economies of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but also Russia, helping Moscow offset some of the pain from US-led sanctions related to the war in Ukraine.  Look at what is happening today. Who's talking about climate change now? Who's talking about attending to energy security, first and foremost?,  Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in suggestive but careful remarks at the World Government Summit in Dubai. Without energy security, countries will lose the means to tackle climate change, he said. Recent data show that despite rapid growth in renewable energy, total emissions of the gases that allow the Earth to warm are going up, not down, amid rising energy demand and the expansion of fossil fuel use. The International Monetary Fund's Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva encouraged advanced economies to meet the goal of providing USD 100 billion a year in climate finance to developing countries. She made the remarks this week at Dubai's World Government Summit, where she unveiled an IMF paper titled  Feeling the Heat,  about adapting to climate change in the Middle East. The argument made repeatedly by Sultan al-Jaber, who is both the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change and Managing Director of Abu Dhabi's state-owned oil company, is that the energy transition will take time. And in that period of time, he says, the world will need more oil and gas.  Put simply, we cannot and we must not unplug the current energy system before we have built the new one,  he said at the energy forum. At the UN-backed climate week event, which took place at the opulent Altantis hotel, he said the push to divest from hydrocarbons has led to a supply crunch. In his dual roles as climate change envoy and head of ADNOC, the state-owned oil and gas firm, al-Jaber symbolizes the two paths the UAE is taking. On one hand, the country has committed to net-zero emissions within its own borders by 2050. On the other, it is committing to more oil and gas production for export. The country's commitments do not apply to the emissions from burning that fuel. Al-Jaber summed up this dual track, saying the UAE is expanding production capacity of what he dubbed  the world's least carbon-intensive oil to over 5 million barrels per day  and its natural gas capacity by 30 per cent. Simultaneously, the UAE has plans to invest USD 160 billion in renewable energy to achieve its net-zero pledge. Saudi Arabia, which pledged to have net-zero emissions by 2060, is similarly cutting emissions domestically while vowing to keep pumping oil until the last drop. The production capacity increases come as Gulf Arab countries experience rising temperatures and humidity, as well as water scarcity, threatening food security and life across the Middle East. At the UN climate week event, environmentally conscious participants sipped on coffee and tea and feasted on buffet lunches in between panels and workshops on everything from food sustainability to water scarcity to carbon-credit swaps. It left Yara Wael, 23, from Alexandria, Egypt, excited for her country's turn at hosting this year's major global climate summit, but she was also left baffled. She works with Egypt's Banlastic, which aims to end single-use plastic, and this was her first trip outside Egypt. She pointed out how the paper cups for coffee and tea could have been biodegradable or reusable, and questioned where all the leftover food from the buffet was going.  When we hold an event on the environment or climate change, we have to think about ourselves and what we're doing now,  she said.",

It builds on a $125 million predecessor fund that was led by key GEF team members. The amount was raised from a clutch of global investors including CDC Group of UK, European Investment Bank, Dutch investment firm FMO, Proparco, Swedfund, BIO, International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private investment arm of the Word Bank and the US Development Finance Corporation.The fund, South Asia Growth Fund II, is a growth equity-fund targeting climate themed businesses in South Asia with a focus on India.\u201cClimate growth investing is not just about achieving a positive environmental impact but also acts as a powerful operating and risk-mitigation theme. Focusing onthe effects of climate change, along with the adoption of ESG and Impact principles, can build resilience into companies\u2019 business models,\u201d said Raj Pai, co-founder and managing partner at GEF Capital Partners.The fund will target a diverse set of companies along the resource efficiency supply chain with a focus on clean energy supply chain, energy efficiency technologies and services, efficient use of water resources and environmental products and services. GEF has already deployed two-third of the committed capital to various Indian firms including Pricne Pipes and Fittings, Premier Energies, 3SC and Syrma SGS.\u201cThe climate sector presents an investment opportunity of more than $1 trillion in South Asia. GEF looks to build on the team\u2019s strong track record of investing and providing attractive exits from the India portfolio of GEF and Global Environment Fund, which has built several billion-dollar companies, including ReNew Power, one of Asia\u2019s largest renewable energy generation company and IEX, which is India\u2019s largest energy exchange marketplace,\u201d said Sridhar Narayan, another co-founder and managing partner at GEF.GEF Capital was spun out of US-based Global Environment Fund Capital Advisors in 2018, as an investment manager to develop Global Environment Fund\u2019s mid-market and growth equity investment programmes in North America, South Asia and Latin America, its website showed.",

        "articleBody": "A start-up incubated by the Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi is using green technology which avails less energy, no electricity or furnace and is completely pollution-free, to convert waste from steel mills into useable products. Steel mills generate a huge amount of waste, most of which gets thrown into landfills contributing to environmental pollution.  Green Trek, a Jammu and Kashmir-based start-up, was founded by Satinder Nath Gupta and his son Sandeep Gupta, and uses extractive metallurgy to address the problem of pollution. According to officials, the team uses clean combustion techniques to trim the waste into a metal with high iron content which can then be reused by industries like ship building, stone crushing plants, oil and gas plants and power plants.  We are working on a circular economy model by utilising extractive metallurgy whereby greenhouse gases are reduced and a sustainable waste management process is put in place,  Sandeep told PTI.  The method we have devised uses less energy, uses no electricity or furnace and is 100 per cent pollution-free, and emitting minimal greenhouse gases. The end product is molten meal with an iron content of 99.6 per cent which is then mixed with other metals to make various kinds of high value steel and alloy castings used in a range of industries,  he added. Green Trek's vision is to manufacture quality green steel products by leveraging cutting edge technology and pioneer solid waste management in India and abroad. The team signed an MoU to set up a permanent plant in Himachal Pradesh which will cater to leading companies like Ultratech, ACC and Ambuja Cement.  The objective of this MoU is to facilitate Green Trek to set up a green steel recycling unit for the supply of spares to the locally based heavy industries such as cement plants and stone crushers by minimising greenhouse gases through its unique process of manufacture. The government in this regard would facilitate all necessary approvals, licenses and help to green trek as and when required,  Sandeep added.",

        "articleBody": "At the Siemens Gamesa factory in Aalborg, Denmark, where the next generation of offshore wind turbines is being built, workers are on their hands and knees inside a shallow, canoe-shaped pod that stretches the length of a football field. It is a mold used to produce one half of a single propeller blade. Guided by laser markings, the crew is lining the sides with panels of balsa wood.The gargantuan blades offer a glimpse of the energy future that Europe is racing toward with sudden urgency. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia \u2014 the European Union\u2019s largest supplier of natural gas and oil \u2014 has spurred governments to accelerate plans to reduce their dependence on climate-changing fossil fuels. Armed conflict has prompted policymaking pledges that the more distant threat of an uninhabitable planet has not.Smoothly managing Europe\u2019s energy switch was always going to be difficult. Now, as economies stagger back from the second year of the pandemic, Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine grinds on and energy prices soar, the painful trade-offs have crystallized like never before.Moving investments away from oil, gas and coal to sustainable sources like wind and solar, limiting and taxing carbon emissions, and building a new energy infrastructure to transmit electricity are crucial to weaning Europe off fossil fuels. But they are all likely to raise costs during the transition, an extremely difficult pill for the public and politicians to swallow.The crisis that has inspired Europe to more quickly reach toward clean energy sources like wind and solar also risks pitching it backward by unwinding efforts to shut coal mines and stop drilling new oil and gas wells to replace Russian fuel and bring prices down.In Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, leaders are planning to have several coal-fired power plants that were recently taken off the grid placed in reserve, so that they could be quickly fired up if needed. After years of dithering about investing so much in the natural gas infrastructure, Germany is also accelerating plans to build its own terminals for receiving liquefied natural gas, another fossil fuel.\u201cSecurity of our energy supply stands above everything else at the moment,\u201d said Robert Habeck, the country\u2019s economy minister and a Green party leader in the coalition government.Local officials are taking similar steps. Last week, the Munich government decided to extend the life of one of the city\u2019s coal-fired power plants, scrapping plans to convert it to burn natural gas in spring 2023.And that is in a country that has helped spearhead Europe\u2019s efforts to shift to renewable energy.In Poland, which gets 70% of its energy from coal and has been at loggerheads with the European Union over the climate agenda, the sudden energy shortage is being used by critics as evidence that the push to shut mines was a mistake.Dominik Kolorz, head of the Silesian region of Solidarity Trade Union, said through a translator that \u201cthe so-called EU climate policy\u201d was leading to a \u201chuge economic crisis\u201d and \u201ctotal energy dependence on the Russian Federation.\u201dIn many ways, Europe has been a leading laboratory for the decadeslong transition. It started establishing taxes on carbon emissions more than 20 years ago. The European Union pioneered an emissions trading system, which capped the amount of greenhouse gases companies produced and created a marketplace where licenses for those emissions could be bought and sold. Polluting industries like steel were gradually pushed to clean up. Last year, members proposed a carbon tax on imports from carbon-producing sectors like steel and cement.And it has led the way in generating wind power, especially from ocean-based turbines. Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, for example, has been instrumental in planting rows of colossal whirligigs at sea that can generate enough green energy to light up cities.Europe, too, is on the verge of investing billions in hydrogen, potentially the multipurpose clean fuel of the future, which might be generated by wind turbines.Such exhilarating innovation, though, sits next to despair-inducing obstacles.Even before the invasion of Ukraine, a tight natural gas market, exacerbated by Russia\u2019s restraining of supplies, had pushed gas and electricity prices to record levels, leading to shutdowns of fertilizer plants and other factories because of high costs. Household energy bills are set to rise by about 50% in Britain and drivers across Europe faced shock at the pump.European countries, most notably Germany, had mapped out strategies that relied on increasing dependence on Russian gas and oil in the medium term. That is no longer an option.After the invasion, Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, halted approval of Nord Stream 2, an $11 billion gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea that directly links Russia to northeastern Germany.As European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said when she announced a plan on March 8 to make Europe independent of Russian fossil fuels: \u201cWe simply cannot rely on a supplier who explicitly threatens us.\u201d The proposal calls for member nations to reduce Russian natural gas imports by two-thirds by next winter and to end them altogether by 2027 \u2014 a very tall order.This week, European Union leaders are again meeting to discuss the next phase of proposals, but deep divisions remain over how to manage the current price increases amid anxieties that Europe could face a double whammy of inflation and recession.On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that intense focus on quickly replacing Russian oil could mean that major economies \u201cneglect or kneecap policies to cut fossil fuel use.\u201dThere are other technological, financial, regulatory and political hurdles. The ability to cheaply generate, transport and store a clean replacement fuel like hydrogen to power trucks, cars and airplanes remains years away.And there is the need to find a better business model.Siemens Gamesa is the world\u2019s leading maker of offshore wind turbines, a key vehicle for achieving climate targets. The company is also working on a giant turbine that would be dedicated solely to producing green hydrogen.Yet, at the company\u2019s offshore design center in Brande, a two-hour drive from Aalborg, the conversations focus on worries as much as bright prospects. The company just replaced its CEO because of poor financial performance.Industry executives say that despite the huge climate ambitions of many countries, Siemens Gamesa and its competitors are struggling to make a profit and keep the orders coming in fast enough to finance their factories. It doesn\u2019t help that building plants is often a condition for breaking into new markets like the United States, where Siemens Gamesa agreed to erect a facility in Virginia.Morten Pilgaard Rasmussen, chief technology officer of the offshore wind unit at Siemens Gamesa, said that companies like his \u201care now forced to do investments based on the prosperous future that we are all waiting for.\u201dRasmussen and other executives added that identifying suitable areas for wind turbines and obtaining permits required for construction take \u201cfar too long.\u201d Challenges are based on worries that the vast arrays of turbines will interfere with fishing, obstruct naval exercises and blight views from summer houses.To Kadri Simson, Europe\u2019s commissioner for energy, renewable energy projects should be treated as an \u201coverriding public interest\u201d and Europe should consider changing laws to facilitate them.\u201cWe cannot talk about a renewables revolution if getting a permit for a wind farm takes seven years,\u201d Simson said.Still, environmental regulations and other rules relating to large infrastructure installations are usually the province of countries rather than EU officials in Brussels.And steadfast opposition from communities and industries invested in fossil fuels make it hard for political leaders to fast-track energy transition policies.In Upper Silesia, Poland\u2019s coal basin, bright yellow buses display signs that boast they run on 100% electric, courtesy of a grant from the European Union. But along the road, large billboards mounted before the invasion of Ukraine by state-owned utilities \u2014 erroneously \u2014 blame Brussels for 60% of the rise in energy prices.Down in the Wujek coal mine, veterans worry if their jobs will last long enough for them to log the 25 years needed to retire with a lifelong pension. Closing mines not only threatens to devastate the economy, several miners said, but also a way of life built on generations of coal-mining.\u201cPushing through the climate policy forcefully may lead to a drastic decrease in the standard of living here,\u201d said Kolorz at Solidarity\u2019s headquarters in Katowice. \u201cAnd when people do not have something to put on the plate, they can turn to extreme populism.\u201dClimate pressures are pushing at least some governments to consider steps they might not have before.German officials have determined that it is too costly to keep the country\u2019s last three remaining nuclear power generators online past the end of the year. But the quest for energy with lower emissions is leading to a revival of nuclear energy elsewhere.Britain and France say they plan to invest in smaller nuclear reactors that can be produced in larger numbers to bring down costs.Britain might even build a series of small nuclear fusion reactors, a promising but still unproven technology. Ian Chapman, CEO of the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority, said every route to clean energy must be tried if there is to be any hope of reaching net zero emissions in three decades, the deadline for avoiding catastrophic climate change. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything we possibly can,\u201d he said.In the short term, much of what the European Union is proposing involves switching the source of fossil fuels, and, in particular, natural gas, from Russia to other suppliers like the United States, Qatar and Azerbaijan, and filling up storage facilities as a buffer. The risk is that Europe\u2019s actions will further raise prices, which are already about five times higher than a year ago, in a market where supplies are short in part because companies are wary of investing in a fuel that the world ultimately wants to phase out.Over the longer term, Europe and Britain seem likely to accelerate their world-leading rollout in renewable energy and other efforts to cut emissions despite the enormous costs and intense disruptions.\u201cThe EU will almost certainly throw hundreds of billions of euros at this,\u201d said Henning Gloystein, a director for energy and climate at Eurasia Group, a political risk firm. \u201cOnce the trains have left the station, they can\u2019t be reversed.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Adani Power on Tuesday said it has collaborated with IHI Corporation and Kowa Company to study ammonia co-firing for environmentally sustainable power generation.  Adani Power Ltd (APL), IHI Corporation, and Kowa Company, Ltd (Kowa), have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to study the feasibility on a modification to achieve 20 per cent liquid ammonia co-firing ratio and thereafter extend this to a ratio up to 100 per cent mono-firing at the Adani Power Mundra Coal Fired Power Plant,  a company statement said.  APL aims to lead India's initiatives in achieving the targets of greenhouse gas reduction by evaluating the possibility and potential of ammonia as a fuel in thermal power generation which will utilize Green Hydrogen-derived ammonia in the existing thermal power plant.  Kowa supported APL by conducting a global survey of hydrogen and ammonia-related technologies being utilised for power generation.  IHI Corporation has already successfully demonstrated its ammonia co-firing technology at a large-scale commercial coal-fired power plant in Japan and responded to many inquiries related to ammonia co-firing globally.  To achieve de-carbonisation of APL's coal-fired assets, the parties, by considering the possibility of ammonia co-firing through the studies, aim to de-carbonise APL's coal fired assets with an objective to potentially implement the technology in other coal-fired units within India.  These studies contribute to carbon neutrality in India, which is in line with the  India-Japan Clean Energy Partnership (CEP)  that was announced by the Indian and the Japanese governments on March 19, 2022.  This will aim to promote energy cooperation between India and Japan through diverse and realistic energy transitions by utilising all energy sources and technologies to ensure energy security, carbon neutrality and economic growth.  In addition, the parties intend to conduct research and development, demonstration and commercial implementation in parallel with that in Japan to achieve early global implementation of fuel ammonia supply chain.",

        "articleBody": "A 25-year vision document has proposed replacing coal-based power generation capacity by stepping up the installed renewable energy generation base to 85% of the total requirement at an investment of '60 lakh crore, said officials with knowledge of the matter. Based on this, coal's contribution will drop to a 10th by 2047 from more than half now, backing up the Prime Minister's carbon-reduction pledge. The estimated investment requirement is for 1,125 GW of renewable energy capacity and domestic manufacturing of 50 GW of renewable energy equipment by 2047, raising the prospect of a big boost for such utilities.According to the proposal prepared by the renewable energy ministry, coal-fired capacity will initially rise to 267 GW by 2030 from the present 210 GW and, subsequently, decline to 140 GW by the 100th year of India's independence. Coal-fired power stations with a capacity of 40 GW are currently being built. The vision document implies India will freeze its coal-based power generation capacity and phase out such plants as they age. Renewable energy secretary Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi will hold a virtual stakeholder consultation with the industry on Thursday on the proposal. Energy Security Prime Goal  In 2030, coal-based power is expected to be 33% of the total installed 817 GW capacity. Coal now accounts for close to 53% of the total 393 GW installed capacity.The share of coal-based capacity is proposed to be cut to 10.5% in 2047, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's net-zero commitment in Glasgow last November and his Independence Day announcement to make India self-sustaining in energy by the 100th year of independence, a senior government official said. The share of renewable energy in generation is expected to increase to 67% by 2047 from 22% now. 90112049 This means renewable energy is targeted to swap positions with coal, which currently accounts for 73% of power generation, which is projected to decline to 24% in 25 years, as per the document.Of the 1,325 GW projected installed capacity by 2047, 1,125 GW is targeted to be based on renewable energy, 140 GW on coal, and 10 GW on gas. The installed capacity of nuclear power generation is proposed to be raised to 50 GW in 2047 from 7 GW now.The ministry has identified the key goals for the country in 2047 as energy independence and security, enhancing decarbonisation of the energy sector, self-sufficiency in equipment manufacturing and becoming a global hub for green hydrogen.Experts said the proposal is key to India's energy security given the lessons learnt from the impact of Covid and, more recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.In his Independence Day speech, Modi had said India spends over \u20b912 lakh crore on energy imports every year and, to progress, energy independence was the need of the hour.

President Xi Jinping has pledged to bring China's total wind and solar capacity to at least 1,200 GW and to cap its carbon emission to a peak by 2030.  China is going to build the biggest scale of solar and wind power generation capacity on the Gobi and desert in history, at 450 GW,  He Lifeng, director of the National Development and Reform Commision (NDRC), said on the sidelines of the National People's Congress. China had installed 306 GW of solar power capacity and 328 GW wind capacity by the end of 2021. The construction of about 100 GW of solar power capacity is already under way in the desert area. He also acknowledged that high-efficient coal-fired power plants and ultra-high voltage electricity transmission lines are required in order to support the steady operation of the grid system amid large scale of renewable power installation. Coal-fired power utilities can generate a stable baseload power supply to renewables, which can fluctuate with weather conditions. He's comment echoed a statement from China's Vice Premiere Han Zheng this week that China should give full play to  coal's basic guaranteeing role in energy supplies . The NDRC said in its 2022 work plan issued on Saturday that China will  continue to leverage the peak-shaving and basic supporting role of traditional energy, especially coal and coal-fired power. ",

        "articleBody": "India's state-run fuel retailers are increasing their ethanol storage capacity by 51% as the nation targets to double the biofuel's blending with gasoline to 20% by 2025, a director at the country's top refiner Indian Oil Corp said on Friday. India is the world's third biggest oil importer and relies on foreign suppliers to meet more than 80% of its demand.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2070, and is encouraging industries to switch to cleaner options including renewable and biofuels to cut carbon footprint. India is close to achieving its target of 10% ethanol blended gasoline in this fiscal year ending March 31, SSV Ramakumar said in an energy conference. Last year, India brought forward its target of selling 20% ethanol blended fuel across the country by five years to 2025, with sales beginning in some parts of the country from April 2023. India's federal finance ministry has proposed a tax of 2 rupees a liters on unblended petrol from October. State-run companies Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp own storage to hold 178 million litre of ethanol.  With current capacity, about 4.30 billion litres of ethanol can be handled annually considering 15 days of coverage period. With tankage of 446.4 million litres by 2025, about 10.6 billion liters of ethanol can be handled annually,  Ramakumar said.",

        "articleBody": "India could become a global green energy superpower with exports of clean energy rising to $500 billion over the next 20 years, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries, said on Wednesday. Indian companies including Reliance have announced plans worth billions of dollars to boost India's renewable energy capacity including building battery storage, fuel cells and producing green hydrogen at less than $1 per kilogram.  If the last 20 years, we were known for India's emergence as an IT superpower, next 20 years, I believe, along with technology, will mark our emergence as a superpower in energy and life sciences,  Ambani, one of Asia's richest men, said at the Asia Economic Dialogue. India is the world's third largest oil importer and consumer and its power sector is heavily reliant on coal. Ambani said India should have a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels in the next two to three decades.  For the next two to three decades, India's dependence on coal and imported oil will continue. But, we must have a plan to eliminate that in the next two to three decades.  The billionaire said India would have to follow  low-carbon and no-carbon strategies  in the near and medium term. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to make India a net-zero carbon emitter by 2070. The nation plans to install 450 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030, from about 105 GW currently, and has recently announced plan to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year by 2030.  We have to make sure (we)... bring cost of green hydrogen at a dollar per kilo and make sure that we transport and disburse it also at less than a dollar per kilo,  Ambani said.  I think we will be able to do all this plus or minus 20%,  he said. ",

        "articleBody": "State-owned hydro power giant NHPC has incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary for clean energy business, including green hydrogen.  As per a BSE filing, the new company -- NHPC Renewable Energy Ltd -- was registered with Registrar of Companies, NCT of Delhi & Haryana, on February 16, 2022.  The development comes against the backdrop of the government's focus on renewable energy and target of 500 GW of clean energy by 2030.  The government on Thursday unveiled the first part of the much-awaited National Hydrogen Policy, allowing free inter-state wheeling of renewable energy used in the production of green hydrogen and ammonia, among other things. State-owned NTPC has already incorporated NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd for its expansion in clean energy space.  Later, in a statement issued by Ministry of Power, NHPC CMD A K Singh said, The incorporation of NHPC Renewable Energy Ltd shows our deep commitment towards tapping renewable energy which helps in reduction of carbon emissions and in producing clean and green energy.   The decision of setting up a subsidiary for renewable energy comes at a time when NHPC, which is predominantly a hydro player, plans to increase the share of renewable energy in its generation portfolio, he added.  The formation of the renewable energy unit had received the nod of Department of Investment and Public Asset Management and NITI Aayog in December 2021.  The subsidiary shall develop renewable energy projects either in standalone mode or through formation of special purpose vehicles with collaboration of other agencies, it stated.  Currently, NHPC's total installed generation capacity is 7071 megawatt (MW) which includes 100 MW of solar/ wind energy-based plants. Another 5,999 of hydro and 105 MW of solar plants are under construction, it stated.  NHPC is expanding its renewable energy portfolio and has taken up several projects under different modes, which are under the tendering / development stage.  Recently, NHPC signed a Letter of Intent with Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd (RRECL) for development of 10,000 MW renewable energy projects / parks in Rajasthan, it stated.",

        "articleBody": "A global supply crunch of electrolysers needed to produce green hydrogen and a lack of domestic manufacturers to make them pose a major challenge to India's ambitious targets to use the zero-carbon fuel, a government official told Reuters. India, which unveiled the first phase of its hydrogen policy on Thursday, plans to manufacture 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year by 2030, half of the European Union's 2030 target of 10 million tonnes. Green hydrogen has the best environmental credentials of the various categories of the clean-burning fuel because it is produced using renewable energy. For India, it is critical to its plans to cut carbon emissions, but its green hydrogen target would require at least 10 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyser capacity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.  The kind of electrolyser capacity that will be required to realise all these ambitious programmes, they are not available right now in the country,  S. S. V. Ramakumar, a director at the country's top refiner Indian Oil who helped to frame the country's hydrogen policy, told Reuters.  All the production capacity and order books of big global players are booked and overflowing till 2025,  he said. India will initially import electrolysers, he said adding that state-run refiners planned to form joint ventures with foreign companies manufacturing the equipment. Power Minister R K Singh said in September India would need at least 10 GW of electrolyser capacity. Global electrolyser capacity was 0.3 GW in 2020, and is expected to reach nearly 17 GW by 2026, an International Energy Agency (IEA) report found in December 2021. Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries has said it plans to build an electrolyser unit in western Gujarat state, but it is unclear when the unit will start commercial production.  India expects initial demand to mainly come from refiners and fertiliser firms, followed by the steel industry and transport. India's refineries are expected to produce 38,000 tonnes of green hydrogen by 2025, Ramakumar said.",

        "articleBody": "Renewable energy companies on Thursday welcomed National Hydrogen Policy but sought clarity on charges for intra-state wheeling of electricity. Manoj K Upadhyay, founder and chairman, ACME Group said, the policy is the first concrete step in the direction of creating a favourable regulatory and enabling environment for the green hydrogen and ammonia sector in India.   The government has tried to address some of the key demands of the industry in terms of open access, grid banking and faster approvals for green hydrogen and ammonia projects,  he said welcoming the provisions to set up bunkers near ports for the export of green ammonia.  Going forward, it will be important to build upon the first phase of the policy and for the government to subsequently come up with policy measures for initial demand creation by means of mandatory green hydrogen and ammonia purchase obligations and at the same time, an equivalent of PLI scheme for green ammonia to make India competitive globally, he added.  ReNew Power Chief Commercial Officer Mayank Bansal said the policy is  a very good step in the right direction as India looks to become a net-zero economy by 2070 and will add to the momentum to that crucial goal.    Currently, manufacturing green hydrogen is a costly proposition and in cognizance of this, the government has correctly waived inter-state transmission charges for a period of 25 years, which will help in bringing down the cost of green hydrogen.   The government has also allowed banking of power for 30 days, which will help improve the utilization of capital-intensive electrolyser assets,  he said.  The firm however sought more clarity on application of cross-subsidy surcharge and additional cross-subsidy surcharge since the policy allows production at different locations by different parties.   Further, the decision to include biomass as a fuel for generation of green hydrogen is a step in the right direction,  added Bansal.  He said it's a much-needed initiative and now state governments should take the cue from this policy and extend benefits such as waiver of intra-state transmission charges and electricity duty.   This will help the cause of making India a green hydrogen hub,  said Bansal.  Anish De, National Head - Energy, Natural Resources and Chemicals, KPMG in India, said transmission charges waiver till 2025 is open ended in terms of capacity.   Double edged sword - if a lot of capacity comes in it will be policy success but at the cost of other transmission users and ratepayers. There is already a lot or noise on high transmission charges,  he said.  Stating that not all capacity will be on inter-state, he said, how state regulators play needs to be seen.  They are not obliged by law to comply on charges.    Cross subsidy surcharge implications need to be understood especially for third party developers. The policy talks of own or third party development in the same breath, but the law sees it differently,  he added.  Anvesha Thakker, Partner and Lead, Renewable Energy, KPMG in India, said green hydrogen is one of the most critical clean energy sources for decarbonizing India's energy needs and enhancing energy security in a sustainable manner.   In the newly announced Green Hydrogen Policy, the government has touched upon several factors to bring down costs and improve ease of implementation of green hydrogen/ green ammonia projects,  he said.   However, the policy needs to address the expectations of hydrogen producers by providing clarity on demand side measures such as hydrogen purchase obligations. Similarly, there is no clarity as yet on measures to facilitate localization of electrolyzer manufacturing. Further, there is no mention of derivatives of green hydrogen other than green ammonia, such as methanol. ",

        "articleBody": "Nearly 400 buses in Indore will soon run on Bio-CNG to be generated from waste at a plant which will be virtually inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here in Madhya Pradesh on February 19, civic officials said on Thursday. The plant has been set up in 15 acres of a trenching ground of the Indore Municipal Corporation in Devguradia area with an investment of Rs 150 crore through the public-private partnership (PPP) mode, they said. The civic body has claimed it to be the largest such Bio-CNG plant in South Asia. The plant is capable of producing 19,000 kg of Bio-CNG (compressed natural gas) per day from 550 tonne of wet waste (of fruits, vegetables, raw meat, stale food, green leaves and flowers) and a part of this gas produced will soon be used to run 400 buses in the city, officials in the civic said. These buses are currently running on diesel and they would be converted to operate on Bio-CNG in a phased manner, they said. In the first-phase, 55 Bio-CNG buses will start running in the city from this month itself, they added. According to an official, the Indore Municipal Corporation has not spent a single rupee on this plant. In fact, a private company roped in for setting up the plant will pay a premium of Rs 2.5 crore to the civic body every year in lieu of wet waste being provided to run the plant, he said. As per an agreement with the company, the cost of the Bio-CNG to be sold to the civic body from the plant will be less by Rs 5 per kg than the prevailing market rate of the green fuel, the official said. The city, having a population of around 35 lakh, generates nearly 700 tonne of wet waste and 400 tonne dry waste every day and different facilities have been set up here for its safe disposal. Indore has been adjudged as the cleanest city in the country in the 'Swachh' survey for the last five years, as the cleanliness model here is based on the '3R' (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) model, officials said.",

        "articleBody": "India will allow companies that manufacture green hydrogen to install renewable energy generating plants without transmission costs, the country's power minister said on Wednesday.   Green hydrogen manufacturers can set up renewable energy capacity by themselves. We will give them free transmission until 2025 and banking for 30 days,  Power Minister R.K. Singh said. Banking allows renewable energy producers to transmit unused electricity to the grid, which can subsequently be used whenever needed, he said, adding that transmission charges would be waived for companies setting up manufacturing facilities before 2025.  More details on incentives for green hydrogen manufacturing will be made public on Thursday when India releases the first part of its national hydrogen policy, Singh said. India will soon release guidelines on industrial use of green hydrogen and ammonia, he said, without specifying when. Singh said in September that India planned to provide federal financial support for the setting up of electrolysers as it wants to make the use of green hydrogen mandatory for refineries and fertiliser plants. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, has the best environmental credentials of the various shades of the clean-burning fuel, which can also be produced using fossil fuel as the energy source to electrolyse water.",

        "articleBody": "The government is likely to announce a policy tomorrow to enable green hydrogen manufacturing firms to set up renewable plants or source the energy from anywhere in the country without transmission charges, power and renewable energy minister R K Singh said on Wednesday. Singh also said the government is considering a uniform renewable purchase obligation (RPO) mechanism to be followed by all states. Presently all states have set their own RPO targets but most have not even achieved them. Non-compliance will invite penalties as per the Electricity Act, he said. The to-be-unveiled green hydrogen policy forms the first measure of the Union power ministry's green hydrogen mission.  The green hydrogen manufacture can set up clean energy capacity by themselves anywhere. We will give them open access and banking for 30 days,  Singh said at an event. Open access is the access to transmission network to buy power from the source of choice. Banking provision would enable a generator to bank his unconsumed power with distribution company and take back when required. Singh said the waiver of transmission charges to green hydrogen manufacturing companies will be available if they set up facilities before 2025. He said in the next phase of policy, the government is likely to put mandates on industry on use of green hydrogen and ammonia in a graded manner. The proposal is with the expenditure finance committee and will require Cabinet nod, he said. ",

By storing cheaper, green power during the off peak hours using battery or hydro-power storage and releasing it during peak electricity consumption period makes it more economical and wide spread.Analysts estimate India needs 50GWh storage capacity to meet its 450-500 GW renewable energy commitment.\u201cWithout long duration storage, energy transition at large scale will take much longer period. Decarbonisation is not just critical from an climate change perspective but also for India\u2019s energy security. Price of imported LNG gas used by industrial users has touched $18-$20/mmBtu range and as importers we have no control over prices,\u201d said Anil Chalamalasetty, Managing Director Greenko.China like India is ramping up capacity, seeking to build out 65 GWh of pumped storage to be built by 2025. Recently, it commissioned a 3.5GW of storage plant.Greenko Group has an installed capacity base of 7.3 GW across solar, wind and hydro generation technologies spread over approximately 100+ projects across 15 states nationwide.

So-called blue hydrogen is made using fossil fuels but captures the carbon dioxide formed during its production, and Reliance sees the conversion as a temporary measure until the cost of green hydrogen, produced from the electrolysis of water using renewable energy, becomes competitive. \u201cIn the interim, till cost of green hydrogen comes down, RIL can be the first mover to establish a hydrogen ecosystem, with minimal incremental investment, in India,\u201d the company said. \u201cSubsequently, as hydrogen from syngas is replaced by green hydrogen, the entire syngas will be converted to chemicals.\u201dAmbani, who\u2019s built his fortune on fossil fuels, plans to replace sales of road fuels like diesel and gasoline with cleaner alternatives as he seeks to hit a net-zero target for his conglomerate by 2035. The project would compete with international plants such as one proposed in Saudi Arabia, which is also seeking to boost hydrogen production. Ambani has vowed to produce green hydrogen at $1 per kilogram, a more than 60% reduction from today\u2019s costs, by the turn of this decade. Last month, he announced plans to invest about $75 billion in renewables infrastructure, which could transform India into a clean-hydrogen juggernaut that\u2019s aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s mission.",

        "articleBody": "Compressed natural gas, already popular among cost-conscious passenger vehicle buyers, is now becoming the fuel of choice in the commercial vehicle segment, amid a sharp rise in the price of diesel.Senior industry executives ET spoke to said the uptick in demand for CNG-driven commercial vehicles has been especially strong in the past 12-18 months. The price differential between diesel and CNG has increased in the past few months. There has been an increase in the price of both diesel and CNG, but CNG still has a lot of headroom to grow. Sales of CNG vehicles have been rising due to its better cost efficiency,  said Sanjeev Kumar, head (medium and heavy commercial vehicles) at Ashok Leyland. We expect demand for CNG vehicles will continue to grow, especially on shorter routes,  he said, speaking on the sidelines of the launch of the company's E-Comet Star ICV CNG range.Vinod Aggarwal, managing director of VE Commercial Vehicles, confirmed the higher demand.  There has been a huge migration towards CNG in light- and medium-duty trucks. In Delhi, the price differential between diesel and CNG is more than \u20b940. Fuel efficiency is similar. Operators are now replacing older vehicles with CNG,  he said.The fuel cost for running a medium-duty truck for 7,000 km, at 7 km a litre of diesel, ranges between Rs 80,000 and Rs 90,000, but if the fuel is CNG, the cost would reduce to Rs 45,000-50,000. In Delhi, diesel was selling at Rs 86.67 a litre and petrol at Rs 95.41 on Wednesday. CNG was priced at Rs 43.40 per kg.Rajesh Kaul, vice president (sales & marketing), Commercial Vehicle Business Unit at market leader Tata Motors, said:  Apart from vehicle operating cost savings on account of improved fuel efficiency and lower prices of CNG, the CNG vehicles also offer a reduction in costs owing to the exemption in green tax in certain states. At Tata Motors, the share of CNG vehicles in intermediate and light commercial vehicles and small commercial vehicles has reached around 44% and 33%, respectively, from 16% and 5% in FY21. In its overall commercial vehicle portfolio, CNG accounted for about 16% year-to-date in FY22, compared with 3.4% in FY21.",

        "articleBody": "Britain will hold yearly auctions to support new renewable projects from 2023, the government said on Wednesday, as it seeks to boost low carbon power production to meet its climate goals. Britain has a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and plans to generate 40 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from offshore wind by 2030 - up from around 10 GW currently. The move also comes amid spiralling energy costs, with a cap on prices for around 22 million British households due to rise 54% from April because of record wholesale gas prices.  The more clean, cheap and secure power we generate at home, the less exposed we will be to expensive gas prices set by international markets,  Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said in a statement. Under Britain's contracts for difference (CfD) support scheme, the government offers a contract, or strike price, for a guaranteed minimum price of electricity for companies whose renewable projects win in an auction. If the wholesale electricity price goes above the strike price the renewable generators pay back the difference to the government. Some detractors of renewable power have blamed the energy price hike in part on the government's renewable support schemes which are paid for by levies on electricity bills. However, the newly announced April price cap level is the first where consumers have not had to pay any costs relating to the renewables CfD scheme, Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Britain's energy regulator Ofgem said on Tuesday. Costs relating to environmental and social costs on an average energy bill will fall by 4% from April, Ofgem data showed.",

        "articleBody": "ReNew Power has commissioned Gujarat's first wind-solar hybrid project of 17.6 MW at the Chlor-Alkali unit of Grasim Industries Ltd in Vilayat, Bharuch. The first phase of the hybrid project, with 17.6 MW commercial-scale wind-solar, commenced operations last week and is expected to generate 80 million units of renewable energy every year, mitigating 75,000 tCO2e (carbon emissions) annually, the company said in a statement.  The partnership will expand further with an additional 16.68 MW, which will be commissioned in the next financial year (FY23), as part of the second phase.  The project is being developed by ReNew Green Solutions (RGS), the B2B arm of ReNew Power.  Both the parties have entered into a 25-year PPA (power purchase agreement), which will see the project supply power for the plant at Vilayat, Bharuch, via an open access mechanism.  Once both phases are commissioned with a combined capacity of 34.28 MW, the partnership is expected to generate a total of approximately 160 million units of renewable electricity annually, mitigating a cumulative 150,000 tCO2e (carbon emission) a year.  Both phases together have a total investment of Rs 3.82 billion (USD 51 million or Rs 382 crore) through an equity partnership.  Mayank Bansal, Chief Commercial Officer, ReNew Power, said in the statement,  With corporates increasingly harnessing renewable energy, ReNew aims to develop around 250 MW of wind-solar hybrid projects in Gujarat for commercial & industrial consumers, like we have just done at Vilayat, Bharuch.

The company is waiting for the financial approval of the government which is expected soon, Singh said while speaking with PTI over the phone.  He added that after the approval, NHPC will begin the execution of the ambitious project in Arunachal Pradesh at a cost of around Rs 30,000 crore.  Asked about the timeline for the project, he said,  We already have in-hand forest and environment clearances. We aim to begin the construction of the project in the coming April-June period. Clearances were accorded after the requisite due diligence and fulfilling all the statutory requirements.   Sharing further details, the CMD said the final forest clearance was issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) in March 2020 after the submission of a compliance report by the state government.   It is important to mention that the Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary and Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary are located about 14 km and 35 km away from the reservoir periphery of the project, respectively.   Hence, no part of the sanctuaries will be affected by the project,  Singh said.  Instead, the project will be instrumental in bringing overall prosperity to the region in terms of infrastructure development and socioeconomic development apart from the green energy generation and flood moderation in the downstream areas of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, the CMD said.  It will take around 108 months to construct the project, which will come up in hilly ranges against challenging weather conditions, Singh said.  Singh further said a sum of Rs 850 crore is being paid to the landowners. The entire payment process will be cleared within a week.  According to additional information shared by NHPC, its Dibang Multipurpose Project is envisaged as a storage project with flood moderation as the key objective.  The project shall generate 2,880 MW (12x240 MW) power to produce 11,223 million units (MU) of energy in a 90 per cent dependable year.  The proposed dam axis for the project is located around 1.54 km upstream of the confluence of river Ashu Pani with river Dibang, and on river Dibang in the Lower Dibang Valley District of Arunachal Pradesh.  The project envisages the construction of a 278-metre-high concrete gravity dam.  Project implementation shall be beneficial for the downstream population due to the significant flood moderation.",

        "articleBody": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s ambitious effort to pivot his conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. toward green energy could transform India into a clean-hydrogen juggernaut.Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man, announced plans earlier this month to invest $75 billion in renewables infrastructure including generation plants, solar panels and electrolyzers. There is growing speculation that the strategy entails transforming all of that clean power into hydrogen, one of the largest endorsements in the next-generation fuel.Analysts say Reliance is likely to opt for hydrogen in a bid to avoid India\u2019s wholesale electricity market, which is dominated by financially stressed utilities and plagued by delayed payments.\u201cReliance is preparing itself to capture the entire value chain of the green hydrogen economy,\u201d said Gagan Sidhu, director at the Centre for Energy Finance at New Delhi-based think tank CEEW. \u201cThey clearly have seen the writing on the wall.\u201dGreen hydrogen -- made from water and clean electricity -- is seen as crucial for the world\u2019s emissions reduction goals, helping consumers and key industries such as steel transition to lower-carbon fuels. Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year announced a plan to make India, the world\u2019s third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and a major energy importer, into a global hub for production and export of the fuel.   89215386While Reliance hasn\u2019t broken out how much will be devoted to hydrogen, the $75 billion investment in clean energy is by far the biggest in the country. Other companies such as Adani Enterprises Ltd. and state-run energy firms NTPC Ltd. and Indian Oil Corp. also have set plans for green hydrogen.The number of countries with a hydrogen strategy doubled last year to 26, and expected plans from the U.S., Brazil, India and China could reshape the global market, according to BloombergNEF. But the sector is still experimental and far from commercially viable. India is relying on the country\u2019s billionaires, including Ambani and his rival Gautam Adani, to lead the way. A key challenge will be to produce it at affordable costs. Green hydrogen produced by renewables is far from competitive compared to other fuels, costing nearly double the price using coal, India\u2019s main source of electricity generation. Ambani has vowed to produce green hydrogen at $1 per kilogram, a more than 60% reduction from today\u2019s costs. \u201cReliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade,\u201d Ambani said last year.Reaching a $1 price point will require a dramatic drop in the cost of electrolyzers, the equipment needed to make green hydrogen, according to Debasish Mishra, a Mumbai-based partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. In addition, a capacity utilization of more than 80% will be required, and that should be powered by constant energy supplies at less than 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, Mishra said. To achieve around-the-clock supplies, supplemental forms of energy such as storage or hydropower will be needed, and that can take the cost beyond the desired levels. Ambani may also be hoping for government support. \u201cNo one knows if we can get there,\u201d said R. Ramachandran, a former director for refineries at state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp. \u201cIf Reliance succeeds, then there is good opportunity. If it doesn\u2019t, then there may be a need for some government subsidies\u201d or other forms of official support. India plans to unveil its first green hydrogen policy in about 10 days, laying out incentives to draw investment in the sector, Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh said at a virtual seminar on Thursday.The nation wants to offer free transmission of clean power from one province to another for making hydrogen, and make land available for building renewable energy projects as well as facilities to store green hydrogen and green ammonia, the minister said.Reliance, which aims to turn net zero by 2035, said it plans to produce 100 gigawatts of renewable energy, a fifth of the nation\u2019s target for non-fossil capacity by the end of the decade. The company said it\u2019s looking at sites in Gujarat and has made a request to the state government for 450,000 acres in Kutch, a white sand desert on India\u2019s western coast and a favored destination for renewable energy in the country. \u201cReliance has correctly identified areas where they can be cost competitive: green hydrogen and solar,\u201d said Julio Friedmann, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cThey have identified their end game and are making investments to position themselves for market share and growth.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Larsen & Toubro on Thursday said that it has partnered with Norway-based HydrogenPro to access its electrolyser technology to enter the green hydrogen market that most clean-energy space observers tout as the next big thing.As part of the agreement, L&T and HydrogenPro will set up a joint venture company in India to manufacture gigawatt-scale alkaline water electrolysers based on the latter\u2019s technology.Electrolysers are used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen using electricity. When the electricity used in the process is sourced from renewable sources, the end-product is called green hydrogen. The elemental hydrogen can then be used as a fuel in industries such as steel manufacturing that presently burn coal. The energy industry is undergoing a tectonic shift with Green Hydrogen emerging as a key fuel in the future energy basket,\u201d S N Subrahmanyan, the managing director of L&T said in a press statement.\u201cThis will be a win-win partnership given our extensive relationship across the energy industry, deep EPC experience in this sector and successful ongoing collaborations with many MNCs and HydrogenPro's focus to stay ahead of the curve as far as technology leadership is concerned,\u201d he said.With the global focus on sustainability, investors are keen to back green hydrogen. While the technology is nascent and the end-product expensive, investors are betting that technology advancements will soon bring the costs as par with non-renewable energy sources.Indian energy big-wigs like Reliance Industries and the Adani Group too have announced their interest in the green hydrogen market. The former invested in Danish company Stiesdal last October to manufacture electrolysers through its subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL).Energy companies have been chasing manufacturers with proven expertise in manufacturing electrolysers at scale as it is a key piece of the green hydrogen puzzle.According to a recent report by market intelligence and consulting firm Future Market Insights, the global hydrogen electrolyser market is estimated to reach $426.3 million by the end of 2028 and expected to register a compound annual growth rate of 7.2 % per cent between 2018 and 2028.German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp is another player to have developed technology to manufacture electrolysers at scale. Informed sources told ET that over a dozen Indian companies approached Thyssenkrupp to strike a partnership around its proprietary technology, but the latter declined.",

        "articleBody": "The green hydrogen policy will be unveiled in the next 10 days featuring incentives like free transmission for 25 years to boost production of this clean source of energy, Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said on Thursday.   We will come out with the green hydrogen policy in the next 10 days. We will give free transmission for 25 years. So you can generate power for making hydrogen in Rajasthan or transport it to Guwahati or to Baruni refinery (to make hydrogen),  said Singh while addressing a virtual conference on smart metering organised by industry body CII.  The minister also said that the policy will feature dollar denominated bids, offer of land in renewable energy parks and land allocation near ports for creating bunkers for green hydrogen or ammonia.   We want India to emerge as the exporter for green hydrogen... Japan wants to import and Germany also,  Singh said.  Raising the issue of payment for power supply, he said free power supply ultimately affects the entire value chain.   If he (politician or public representative) wants to give 100 units free then he can do so from the budget. We don't mind that. He can give entire taxpayers' money for free electricity or water but then he would not be left with funds for development of roads and other works.   The minister was of the view that if they (states) cannot pay the subsidy for free electricity from their budget then they should not promise such freebies.  He pointed out,  many states are finding it different to pay subsidies (given as free electricity). Many states don't even have an account for these subsidies. Uttar Pradesh is one which doesn't have an account for subsidies, they should be paying. The discoms don't have an account under which they can ask for a subsidy from the state government.   About smart metering, the minister informed that the government will come out with an approved list of models and manufacturers for smart meters.  In this regard, he said,  this is a big opportunity and there are crores of consumers here. If you have the capability then make it (smart meter) entirely here or you can start with 90 to 95 per cent (smart meter manufacturing) here... I don't want to buy anything from our Northern neighbour (China).   The minister also talked about the inbuilt IT capability of smart meters in view of cyber attacks threat.  Union Power Secretary Alok Kumar pointed to the chip shortage problem and said semiconductor chips should be produced more and more in India for faster roll out of the national smart metering programme.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Conglomerate Essar and Progressive Energy have formed a new new joint venture, Vertex Hydrogen, to build the UK's largest hydrogen hub at the Stanlow Manufacturing Complex.Led by Essar as the majority shareholder, Vertex Hydrogen has been formed to provide the catalyst for development of a hydrogen economy across northwest England and north Wales. A total investment of approximately 1 billion pounds will be committed to deliver the hydrogen production hub,  Essar said in a statement.Besides, the company said that the initiative is a core part of a wider strategy by Essar globally to focus on investing in energy transition through the transformation of existing portfolio companies, and investments in new ventures. The UK's first low carbon hydrogen facility at Essar Stanlow will sit at the heart of the 'HyNet' low carbon cluster, to produce a total of 1GW per year of hydrogen, across two units, from 2026.  This is equivalent to the domestic heating energy used by a major British city region, such as Liverpool. As per the statement, waste fuel gases from Essar Stanlow, and natural gas, will be converted by Vertex Hydrogen into hydrogen, with carbon dioxide safely captured and stored by 'HyNet' partner 'Eni SpA', underground offshore in Liverpool Bay. The hydrogen production hub will provide low carbon energy to replace fossil fuels in industry across the 'HyNet' region, as well as heating homes, and fuelling buses, trains and trucks. The hydrogen produced will, in the first instance, be utilised by Essar to reduce its carbon footprint at the Stanlow Manufacturing Complex. In addition, Vertex will provide low carbon hydrogen to a wide range of businesses, including companies from the chemicals, ceramics, paper, glass and flexible power generation sectors, such as Tata Chemicals Europe, Encirc, InterGen, Solvay, Ingevity, Novelis, Glass Futures and Saica Paper  all having expressed interest already .Essar Chairman Prashant Ruia said:  Essar is massively committed to investing in energy transition and is building a portfolio of companies in this space. Vertex Hydrogen is a central component of that vision, which will be instrumental in helping create a hydrogen future for northwest England and northeast Wales. ",

        "articleBody": "The European Commission's draft proposal that natural gas and nuclear energy should be labelled as green investments has split money managers.Below are the views of some investors spoken to by Reuters.Ian Simm, founder and CEO at Impax Asset Management The inclusion of gas and nuclear (with conditions/caveats) in the EU taxonomy reflects a pragmatic approach. It's inconceivable that we can transition to a zero emissions power sector without some contribution from gas or nuclear. Will Martindale, Group Head of Sustainability at Cardano We are comfortable investing in nuclear energy as part of the way in which we see our long-term sustainability objectives. The main concern is almost one of principle. Once you start to interfere politically in the taxonomy, then actually you open the floodgates in terms of future political interference, which is why in our view, it would be preferable that this delegated act wasn't set up the way it was; that includes nuclear as well as gas. But gas, to us, is particularly egregious because it is a fossil fuel; by creating energy, you are releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which does contribute to climate change in a very direct way. And by sending a message that a fossil fuel can be green in specific circumstances, we think is unhelpful. Iain Richards, head of responsible investment at Columbia Threadneedle The taxonomy already has inherent contradictions, allowing activities in the EU preferential treatment relative to other countries or regions. At the end of the day this is a political decision. The reality of energy security is an element and the current stress in consumer prices is notable. Whether as a sustainable investment or as a taxonomy investment, these energy sources should not be excluded.  There are different tenors of investment strategies that can accommodate different tolerances to these things. Sometimes the climate lobby is too idealistic for its own good, putting that ahead of real progress where it matters. Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at KLP This is certainly positive for many Norwegian energy companies as their business activity in larger part could be aligned with (the) taxonomy. Nevertheless, carbon emissions from gas will weigh on a portfolio that seeks low carbon intensity. Philippe Zaouati, CEO of Mirova So today, the second part of the taxonomy, with gas and nuclear, for me is basically useless. It's useless on two aspects. The first one, it's useless because I do not agree with the vision that if gas and nuclear are not in the taxonomy then it will become very difficult to finance these projects; I do not think so. I think the big nuclear plants will be financed anyway; first, because it's mostly public funding and also because the big investors and banks will follow the French government and others in this kinds of projects, anyway, inside or outside of the taxonomy. Then it's also useless because the delegated act clearly states that the reporting will be two-fold. You will be able to report with or without gas and nuclear, and I'm pretty sure that the majority of responsible investors will use the without gas and nuclear figures to report, so I think it will have no impact on the investment decision. My-Linh Ngo, Head of ESG Investment, Portfolio Manager at BlueBay Asset Management, part of RBC Their inclusion in the taxonomy would certainly add further complexity \u2013 and confusion - to what is already a complex matter. For BlueBay, our analysis of the sector would take into account key environmental and social issues associated with those economic activities. Initiatives such as the taxonomy would be an input into our views, informing on our thinking, but we would look to do our own research and formulate our own thoughts. We would also take input from other sources and not be limited to referencing the taxonomy. Peter Giger, Group Chief Risk Officer at Zurich Insurance Some of that is politically driven and will just lengthen the transition or increase the risk of a disorderly transition. Because we don't take the pain today, we're going to take more pain tomorrow. And again, as an investor, you should ask yourself, are you in for the long (term)? Jan K\u00e6raa Rasmussen, Head of ESG at Pension Danmark It will probably not influence our investment strategy. We don\u2019t see gas as a green technology but recognise that it can play a significant role in the energy supply system during a transition period with coal phase out in power generation. Nuclear Power is more complex. The classic technology with large-scale plants based on traditional fission technology is very expensive and inflexible. Moreover, it is associated with security risks and nuclear waste. However, the development of smaller, flexible units based on new technology with considerable less problems from waste etc. is underway and can make nuclear power interesting for investors like us in the future. B\u00e5rd Bringedal, CIO at Storebrand Asset management The taxonomy does not determine what constitute(s) a good investment, or even a good company. It's an important framework for aligning investments to the green economy, but both companies and investors need to make up their own decisions on where to invest. If natural gas and nuclear are included in the taxonomy it will obviously impact our reporting on taxonomy alignment, but it will not have any immediate impact on our policy, product classification according to SFDR (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) or our investments.  Our view is that natural gas and nuclear may be a better energy sources, compared to other non-renewable energy sources, from a climate perspective short term. It is however clear that there are better energy sources from a sustainability perspective long- term and that we need to address that. ",

        "articleBody": "The aviation industry looks at hydrogen-fuelled planes as a solution to decarbonise the sector, but a report by an environmental group released Wednesday found that they will only help limit CO2 emissions.Using hydrogen as fuel produces no climate-warming CO2 when it burns, just water.Automakers and planemakers alike have been looking at it as a means to reduce the climate impact of the transportation sector, although currently most production of hydrogen creates emissions.The introduction into service of hydrogen-fuelled planes from 2035 is one way the aviation industry hopes it can reach net-zero carbon emissions in 2050.If using hydrogen on long-haul aircraft is impossible due to the volume of gas needed,  on the short- to medium-haul flights where hydrogen aircraft are viable, these planes could virtually eliminate carbon emissions,  said the report by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has targeted 2035 to bring hydrogen passenger aircraft to the market, and is looking at developing both a single-aisle turbofan jet and a turboprop commuter aircraft.The ICCT said hydrogen storage would reduce the range of such aircraft compared to current aircraft using convention fuels, but that nevertheless they could be used to carry up to a third of global air traffic.If there was a 100 percent take up with aircraft using green hydrogen on eligible routes, the ICCT found it would  reduce aviation's carbon emissions by 31 percent in 2050, representing a capping of emissions at 2035 levels. A take up of 20-40 percent would result in a 6-12 percent drop in CO2 emissions.The study estimated that green hydrogen would be cheaper than synthetic fuels that could also provide a means to reduce carbon emissions.The ICCT said carbon taxes would be needed to eliminate the price advantage of jet fuel produced from petroleum.",

        "articleBody": "Around 18 GW hydro capacity addition is required to meet the hydro purchase obligation (HPO) norms by 2030 in the country, according to rating agency Icra. To further the growth of hydro energy segment, the Centre has outlined policy measures over the last two-year period to promote the investments in the segment through notification of HPO norms, long term trajectory for HPOs as well as tariff rationalization measures.   Based on the notified hydro purchase obligation norms & trajectory available till 2030, incremental hydro power capacity requirement is estimated to remain significant i.e. at about 18 GW, which corresponds to about 39 per cent increase over the existing installed hydro power capacity in the country,  said Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head - Corporate ratings, Icra. The HPO norms have been subsequently notified by SERCs (state electricity regulatory commission) in few states only, in line with policy targets as of now, he noted. Hence, he stated that timeliness as well as consistency in the notification of HPO norms by SERCs in other states as well as subsequent implementation of the same by the obligated entities too remain a key monitorable. According to an Icra statement, the hydro energy segment faces many other challenges like elongated construction schedule, significant resettlement, rehabilitation and land acquisition issues, delays in clearances and geological/ topological risks which have led to significant time and cost over-run for hydro projects.  This is also reflected from the fact that average project cost for the commissioned hydro project capacity by CPSUs ( central public sector undertakings) during FY 2017-2021 remained at about Rs 13-14 crore /MW. Given the high level of capital intensity for hydro projects, tariff competitiveness of hydro energy too remains modest from the ultimate off-takers' perspective.  On the contrary, tariff competitiveness for solar and wind energy has significantly improved with the bid tariffs remaining well below Rs 3/unit for last 3 to 4 years as against the average power purchase cost for majority of the state discoms remaining Rs 4-5/unit, depending on the mix of sources in power purchased, it noted. Icra says hydro capacity addition in India has remained sluggish historically, with the significant execution challenges as also seen in the incremental capacity addition of about 22 GW between 2000 and 2021, representing CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of mere 3 per cent in the hydro segment.  Further, it says that share of hydro in the overall power generation capacity has declined considerably over the period, with a significant rise in thermal capacity addition seen in 2005 till 2015 and thereafter in the renewable energy segment. With improved tariff competitiveness of solar & wind energy and strong policy focus by the Centre, share of renewables (solar & wind segment) is estimated to grow considerably in the energy generation mix, going forward, it pointed out. However, it stated that the hydro energy segment also remains systemically important from the grid perspective so as to meet the flexibility requirements / peaking power supply. In this context and to further the growth of hydro energy segment, the Centre has outlined policy measures over the last two-year period to promote the investments in hydro segment through notification of HPO norms, long term trajectory for HPO as well as tariff rationalization measures, it noted. The HPO is set at 0.18 per cent for FY2022 which in turn is set to increase up to 2.82 per cent by FY2030 at national level, as notified by Ministry of Power, it stated.  Tariff rationalization measures such as backloading of tariff with 2 per cent escalation and provision for budgetary support at Rs 1 crore /MW for hydro projects of > 200 MW capacity, is expected to alleviate the concern on tariff competitiveness considerably, in the initial years,  Siddhartha Kaushik, Assistant Vice President - Corporate Ratings, Icra, said. While tariff rationalisation measures were outlined by Ministry of Power in March 2019, the same are yet to be incorporated by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) in its tariff regulations applicable for hydro projects.  Further, the policy clarity in terms of support measures especially for pumped hydro storage capacity remains a key monitorable too, it stated.",

The consolidated net profit of the company was Rs 124 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.Its joint managing director and chief executive officer Prashant Jain said the company is soon expected to announce its first green hydrogen project.During the quarter, the company\u2019s total revenue increased by 20% to Rs 1,984 crore from Rs 1,659 crore of the corresponding period of last year. Jain said the company witnessed an increase in short-term sales and realisation in the third quarter.\u201cWe could increase our short-term sales in October and we made the highest EBIDTA in any quarter in the last five years.

        "articleBody": "U.S. refiners and biofuel companies are likely to reach less than half the renewable diesel production projected by the U.S. government for 2025 due to policy and feedstock constraints, according to a study released Tuesday from consultancy Cerulogy. Numerous petroleum refiners across North America are planning to convert facilities to process waste and vegetable oils into renewable fuels, a small but growing market backed by government incentives. The Energy Information Administration estimates renewable diesel production capacity in the United States could increase fivefold by 2024 from 1 billion gallons currently to more than 5 billion gallons per year. But Cerulogy estimated the projects are more likely to yield approximately 2 billion gallons of total renewable diesel production capacity in 2025, meaning at least 2 billion gallons of already announced capacity additions are likely be delayed, canceled or downsized. Achieving EIA predictions would be  exceedingly difficult  and would likely require relying heavily on feedstock imports and a very significant reduction in production of biodiesel - a biofuel made from similar feedstocks but blended with petroleum-based diesel - according to Chris Malins, who authored the report backed by the International Council on Clean Transportation. Achieving EIA forecasts would require an increase of 1.3 billion gallons of feedstock for renewable diesel, largely by diverting waste oils and fats from traditional biodiesel production, raising U.S. soy oil production and increasing U.S. vegetable oil imports, the report said. However, while the fuel significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum diesel, several parties are concerned the increased demand for the oils needed to create it will result in indirect land use change and cause food prices to rise. Annual production of 2 billion gallons of renewable diesel by 2025 is a  high-end estimate  for what can be achieved without causing strong market distortions, Malins said. In addition, policies meant to promote renewable diesel are not strong enough. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard and state policies such as California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard are meant to achieve growth in renewable diesel. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has highlighted the risk of negative market and environmental impacts if the supply of biomass-based diesel is further increased, Malins added. ",

        "articleBody": "Vishwaraj Sugar Industries Ltd (VSIL) will invest Rs 250 crore to set up a new ethanol plant in Karnataka. At present, VSIL has a sugarcane crushing capacity of 11,000 tonnes per day, distillery capacity of 1 lakh litres per day, co-generation capacity of 36.4 MW, and vinegar manufacturing capacity of 70,000 litres per day. In a statement, VSIL announced plans to set up a greenfield ethanol production facility, having a capacity of 2.5 lakh litres per day, within 80 km from the existing factory in the Belagavi district. The company said it has already acquired 110 acres land for this plant.  The estimated project investment is Rs 250 crore and the first full year of operation of this facility shall be FY2024,  the statement said. Moreover, the company plans to set up a brownfield ethanol production, with a capacity of 1.5 lakh litres per day. This expansion, scheduled to be completed by November 2023, is driven by technological up-gradation. It is filing a patent to that effect. This will increase the overall ethanol production capacity to 2.5 lakh litres per day. With both greenfield and brownfield expansion, the total ethanol capacity will reach at 5 lakh litre per day.  We plan to move up the value chain...Razor-sharp focus on high-value high- margin products, such as pharma grade sugar and ethanol, is expected to increase the revenue per tonne of sugarcane crushed over the next five years,  said Mukesh Kumar, Executive Director, VSIL.  Also, we plan to ramp up the capacity for ethanol, taking total capacity to 500,000 litres per day,  he added. In the normal course, price realisation per litre of ethanol stands at Rs 62.7 for the ethanol produced from sugarcane syrup, and Rs 57 for the ethanol produced from molasses. But, in the case of pharma-grade ethanol, the price realisation goes up to Rs 67 per litre, it explained. VSIL said the company has entered into contracts with oil marketing companies for supplying 25 million litres of ethanol commencing from December 2021, as against the supply of 22.5 million litres of ethanol during the 12-month period ended in November 2021. VSIL has already commenced a supply of ethanol for the current period. Recently, the company reported a net profit of Rs 20.67 crore for the nine months period ended December 2021, as compared to Rs 4.17 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Total revenue grew to Rs 337.86 crore from Rs 264.73 crore. In the third quarter ended December 2021, Vishwaraj Sugar posted a 61 per cent rise in total revenue at Rs 133.28 crore compared to Rs 82.75 crore in the year-ago period. The net profit dipped marginally to Rs 29.44 crore from Rs 30.46 crore on higher tax outgo in December quarter, the statement said.",

        "articleBody": "Green Hydrogen is a critical piece of energy transition enabling India to achieve its energy security objectives and net zero commitment. As industrial feedstock or process gas, Green Hydrogen can substitute Grey Hydrogen (derived from fossil fuels) used in oil refineries, fertiliser plants, methanol producing chemical plants and treatment of metals. As energy carrier or vector, Green Hydrogen can be used for blending with piped natural gas (PNG) used in domestic, commercial and industrial applications, electrification of heavy-duty long-haul transportation such as trucking and maritime shipping through Hydrogen fuel cells, energy storage coupling with renewable rich power systems etc.However, the supply chain of Green Hydrogen is complex like any other fossil fuel commodity and includes production from renewable energy sources, storage and delivery (if the production and demand centres are not co-located). Beyond this, many potential end-use applications may need technology and infrastructure to support energy transformations such as Hydrogen to electricity and vice versa, Hydrogen to ammonia, Hydrogen to methanol etc. Green Hydrogen production, storage, and supply needs to meet the purity, pressure, and volume requirements of specific industries and applications.Key factors that determine the speed and scale of Green Hydrogen adoption?Grey Hydrogen production costs vary approximately Rs 75-150/kg depending on the price of natural gas in the current scenario. The domestic retail CNG or PNG prices vary approximately RS 40-90 /kg, which translates to approximately 1-2 INR/Mega Joules of energy considering the lower heating value of this fossil fuel commodity. Achieving parity with these prices will determine the speed and scale of Green Hydrogen adoption. This requires boosting demand for Green Hydrogen in a phased manner thereby achieving economies of scale across the supply chain, indigenisation of supply chain and technology improvement to enhance efficiencies of Green Hydrogen production and transformations with earth abundant raw materials. R&D investments and programs are crucial for technology indigenisation across the supply chain.Much of the debate on reducing the cost of Green Hydrogen is focused on production, particularly electrolyser systems and renewable energy supply. Government intervention and pilot projects must also address and demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Green Hydrogen storage and delivery systems. Our models simulating the techno-economics of Green Hydrogen supply chain indicate that the goal of reducing costs to less than Rs 100/kg cannot be achieved without cost effective storage and delivery systems.Recommendations for supporting Green Hydrogen economy in the upcoming budget sessionThe launch of National Hydrogen Mission (NHM) and various Green Hydrogen pilot projects initiated by public sector undertakings are all steps in the right direction. The upcoming budget can provide more clarity on the short-term strategies of NHM to boost demand for Green Hydrogen including but not limited to Green Hydrogen purchase obligations, Green Hydrogen blending targets with piped natural gas, indigenous manufacturing and pilot projects for technology demonstration. However, the primary focus of budget should be towards boosting R&D investment with public private partnerships (PPP) and grand challenges to demonstrate efficient & cost effective Green Hydrogen electrolysers, storage and delivery solutions using earth abundant electrocatalysts and materials. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) can lead this initiative and design a PPP program to drive R&D investment from India Incorporated in collaboration with premier academic institutes of the country. The budget should provide a concrete roadmap towards developing testing facilities and certification mechanisms relying on globally harmonised standards & regulations for Green Hydrogen production, storage and delivery. Viability gap funding should be focused on Green Hydrogen projects enabling low carbon steel, cement, trucking and maritime shipping. RE power systems are typically oversized to account for variability in the production of green hydrogen systems. A purchase guarantee mechanism to buy back excess renewable electricity can generate alternate revenues for investors and reduce overall cost of production.The budget should also focus towards creating world class talent in the value chain of Green Hydrogen by way of introducing dedicated academic programs or degrees and establishment of national research institutes focusing on Green Hydrogen. This is important to kick start the indigenisation of technology development and support the industry ambitions towards R&D, product development and services in the entire value chain.[This piece was authored by Somesh Kumar, Partner and National Leader \u2013 Power & Utilities, and Shuboday Ganta, Vice President \u2013 Power & Utilities, EY India]",

        "articleBody": "Ethanol blending in petrol has risen to 8.1% in the ethanol year 2020-21, up from 5% in the previous year and 1.5% in 2013-14, thanks to a raft of policy measures that helped increase supply through a combination of assured purchases at government-set remunerative prices and interest subsidy for production capacity expansion.The government has been aiming to increase the share of biofuels in the transportation sector to cut the country\u2019s dependence on oil imports, which account for 85% of the domestic needs. Petrol makes up 15% of total oil consumption in the country and therefore a 10% substitution by ethanol could bring down oil imports by 1.5 percentage points.As more supplies become available, the blending ratio is expected to reach 10% this ethanol year, which began last month. This is about two decades after ethanol blending was piloted in the country. \u201cLimited supply was the biggest constraint. The government has addressed this by providing a supportive policy regime,\u201d said Abinash Verma, director general, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).One of the most important steps has been to have fixed prices based on feedstocks used to produce ethanol, and these prices don\u2019t vary with global petrol prices. An ambitious blending target needed distilleries to expand capacity for which the central government provided generous interest subvention. This was further supplemented by a variety of capital support from different state governments.Another big move was to widen the scope of raw materials used for producing ethanol by including sugar, sugar syrup, surplus rice, and maize. \u201cInclusion of grains helped take ethanol production to several other states. Earlier it was mostly limited to UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka that have large sugarcane crops,\u201d said Verma of ISMA.The government also eased green rules to help compress the time consumed in taking clearances for expansion. The molasses-based ethanol production facility has risen from 228 crore litres per annum in 2016-17 to 520 crore litres now, per ISMA.Expansion in capacity has been aided by offtake guarantees by oil marketing companies, an oil company executive said. Oil companies\u2019 willingness to sign tripartite agreements with ethanol suppliers and lenders further helped.Ease of ethanol purchase tender conditions, favourable transportation rate, and reduction in security deposit also gave distillers great confidence.India aims to further boost ethanol production to be able to take the blending ratio to 20% by 2025. To facilitate this, distilleries, as well as oil marketing companies, will need to build additional storage whereas fuel retailers will need to set up new dispensers so that drivers have a choice to take fuel blended with 20% ethanol or less based on their car\u2019s ability.",

        "articleBody": "India is estimated to add about 10 gigawatt (GW) of total renewable energy capacity in 2022, down 10 per cent year-on-year, according to clean energy consultancy firm Bridge to India.\u201cCapacity addition prospects would depend greatly on the timeline for clarity on transmission lines in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Many projects have already got force majeure relief on account of module supply disruption,\u201d it said. The consultancy\u2019s early estimates for total capacity addition in 2021 is 11.2 GW, split between utility-scale solar with 7.8 GW, rooftop solar with 1.8 GW, and wind with 1.6 GW, 30 per cent below their projection for the year.On basic customs duty (BCD), it added that the distributed solar business, both rooftop solar and open access, would take an immediate hit if it is imposed as expected, from April 2022 onwards.\u201cUtility-scale solar projects, already stuck because of the Supreme Court\u2019s transmission order, would also be impacted adversely because of negative cash flow impact,\u201d it said. A final announcement on BCD is expected as part of the Budget release on 1 February 2022. According to the firm, the softening process in the module supply chain has already begun. But there is still considerable uncertainty on the power supply situation in China and global demand is expected to pick up with 2022 shipment estimates ranging between 170-220 GW. \u201cAny decline would most likely therefore be slow and relatively small. We expect mono-PERC module prices to ease off to about $0.25 levels by end of the year,\u201d it added. The firm expects bid tariffs for central government offtake projects to stay in the Rs 2.10 to Rs 2.40 range. Apart from this, the firm added that clarity on BCD and proposed expansion of the production-linked incentive scheme to cover all bidders would provide a big boost to domestic manufacturing efforts. \u201cIt would be a major change to see industry nucleus shifting away from project development to manufacturing although we expect only about 8-9 of the 16 bidders to finally go ahead with their proposed plans because of overcapacity and viability, financing concerns,\u201d it said. Battery and electrolyser manufacturing schemes are expected to take much longer to take off, added the firm.",

        "articleBody": "Hero Future Energies and Ohmium International on Thursday announced a strategic partnership to set up 1,000 MW of green hydrogen production facilities in India, the UK and Europe.Hero Future Energies (HFE), a leading developer of solar, wind and hybrid/BESS projects, and Ohmium International -- specialised in the design, manufacture and deployment of PEM Electrolysers -- have announced a strategic partnership to develop and build 1,000 MW of Green Hydrogen production facilities in India, the UK and Europe, a joint statement said.According to the statement, Ohmium will be responsible for the design, construction, and operations and maintenance of the hydrogen production facilities.Hero Future Energies will be the build-operate-own partner, generating green energy to power the production facilities and assuming overall ownership of the assets.Srivatsan Iyer, Global CEO, Hero Future Energies, said, \u201cWe are very pleased to partner with Ohmium. Their patented electrolyser technology enables them to design and construct hydrogen production facilities faster and more efficiently than anyone else. By coupling Ohmium's hydrogen expertise with HFE's knowledge and experience as a renewable energy developer, we will meet and perhaps even exceed our ambitious target of 1,000 MW\u201d.Arne Ballantine, CEO, Ohmium International stated, \u201cThis giga-scale effort between Hero Future Energies and Ohmium is going to advance the global Green Hydrogen landscape. Hero Future Energies is one of the leaders and innovators in renewable energy, with a proven track record of success. Together, we'll bring safe, secure and cost-effective green hydrogen energy to not only India but also the world\u201d.This partnership will give a strong push to the development of a robust green hydrogen ecosystem. As countries and businesses strive to achieve their net-zero goals, green hydrogen can be a potential game-changer, particularly when it comes to decarbonisation in hard-to-abate sectors, such as the mobility sector, Iyer said.\u201cThis is a forward-looking partnership, which is perfectly aligned with HFE's vision as an integrated energy transition solutions provider. It will enable us to expand our international footprint as we penetrate new markets,\u201d he added.Hydrogen is an essential element used in steel and chemical production, fertiliser production, refineries, and many other processes.The majority of hydrogen is made from fossil fuels, making it a heavy carbon polluter.Cost-effective green hydrogen \u2013 no-carbon hydrogen made from water electrolysis using renewable energy sources \u2013 is now possible with the latest cost reductions in renewable energy and Ohmium's technology solutions.The world must transition to green hydrogen to meet its Net-Zero emission targets. Capitalising on this, India's National Hydrogen Mission firmly positions the country as a global leader in the large-scale production and export of green hydrogen.India's demand for hydrogen is estimated to increase five-fold and reach nearly 28 MTPA by 2050.",

        "articleBody": "Ram Charan -- the little-known Chennai-based chemicals trader which, of late, has been developing technologies and equipment to convert industrial and municipal waste into energy that leave no residues -- is investing Rs 15,000 crore to set up two such manufacturing plants in Tamil Nadu and Guajrat, a top company official has said. While the Tamil Nadu unit will come up in the Rameshwaram district on a 70-acre land which will be acquired by the end of the month, the Gujarat plant will come on a similar sized plot in the Kutch district and the land for the same should be acquired by the end of the month or early next month.  Both the plants will see an investment of Rs 7,500 crore each and will be up and running in the third quarter of 2022, Kaushik Palicha, a director of the company, and the third generation of the founding family, told PTI from Chennai.  Palicha's father had hailed from the Kutch region of Gujarat and had moved into Kerala's Alleppey in the early part of the last century and then moved onto Madras (now Chennai) in the 1950s where they began chemicals trading in 1965.  Before entering deep-tech research in 2016 they had set up a joint venture with Japanese firm Shinji Kato in Baroda to manufacture speciality plastic components.  Ram Charan's R&D is focused on developing end-of-life chemicals converting unsegregated waste into energy and manufacturing new-generation energy storage devices - the primary reason for the American fund TFCC International to go for such a high valuation and equity partnership for USD 4.14 billion.  Its waste-to-energy products and services are delivered under the brand name 'Entity One' and does not leave any residual waste, he added.  Early December 2021, Ram Charan had announced a USD 4.14-billion investment from the New York-based impact fund TFCC International for an equity consideration of 46 per cent, valuing the company at around USD 9 billion and making it among the largest private equity investments in the country.  Within weeks it signed a USD 2.2-billion deal with the Ghana-based Masri Company to supply waste to energy units that is expected to generate 300 mw of power in the African nation. Late last week, it also bagged a USD 700-million contract to supply similar units to the Azerbaijan-based Kafkans Finanz, which is into logistics, infrastructure, and imports, to set up waste management units and will generate at least 200 mw of power.  Both the orders will be completed by the middle of 2023, he said.  Palicha said while supplies to the Ghana company will begin from November 2022, the same to Kafkans will begin in December 2022 as he expects to get the proposed manufacturing units up and running by the third quarter of 2022.  On the funds for the proposed investment, he said the first tranche of USD 1.7 billion from TFCC will come in any day now as he has already sought the approval from the Reserve Bank and the remaining portion will be internal accruals.  On vast price difference between the Ghana and Azerbaijan deals, he said it is based on the number and capacity of the units and the nature of the waste. While for Azerbaijan it is only 20 units with 2,000 tonne a capacity to turn simple industrial waste into power, for Ghana this is 43 units with 5,000 tonne capacity and the waste is complex given the highly contaminated bauxite mines and cobalt mines the African nation has.   On why he is not tapping the domestic market which has huge opportunities for his business, and despite having a plant in Chennai making smaller units Palicha said the existing public policy and government incentives do not allow him to try it our here.  TFCC International is a deep impact fund with investments from high-net-worth individuals, government agencies and financial institutions, this marks their entry into the country. The fund is also looking at more impact investments here in areas of environment solutions, renewable energy and low-cost housing. Currently, with a portfolio of USD 20 billion invested in South Asia.  Ram Charan has to deploy the TFCC money into environment-to-energy management systems and renewable energy devices with high storage capacity that are made from sodium silicate.  The technology used by Ram Charan allows for zero toxic residue, and can be used to convert all types of unsegregated waste into energy, making it the first of its kind globally and also the safest. Ram Charan is also amongst the first globally to set up end product responsibility for their products, he said, adding this is a globally first innovation.  The technology, developed in-house after research from 2016 has been branded under the name Entity1, and has a slew of products lined up for release from 2022 till 2024 that allows for zero toxic residue, and can convert all types of unsegregated waste into energy.",

        "articleBody": "All-India power production increased marginally in November 2021 supported by increase in generation from renewable sources, said India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).Accordingly, the total all-India generation increased marginally by 2 per cent to 99.4BU (billion units) in November 2021. The overall increase in generation was, however, supported by a 16.4 per cent YoY increase in the generation from renewable sources and a 16 per cent YoY rise in generation from hydro power sources,  Ind-Ra said. Whereas, the generation from coal-based thermal power plants reduced by 0.3 per cent YoY. Besides, the report said the all-India energy demand increased just 1.7 per cent YoY to 99.6 BU in November 2021, after growing 12 per cent YoY in 7MFY22. The slowdown in the improvement was led by the onset of the winter season, impacting the demand from the northern region and southern region.  The reduction in the energy demand in November 2021 is also attributable to lower generation, as reflected in an increase in the power outages at thermal power plants due to coal shortages. Additionally, it said that all-India energy demand for the first 25 days of December improved 3.5 per cent YoY to 88.7BU.In addition, the agency cited an improvement in domestic coal production which has led to a rise in coal inventory levels.Consequently, the number of thermal power plants with critical or subcritical levels of coal stock as per technical criteria has improved to 59 as on November 30, 2021.The coal production cumulatively by Coal India and the Singareni Collieries Companyincreased to 5 per cent YoY to 59.4mt, owing to the improved all-India power demand. The same led to an 11 per cent YoY improvement in the coal offtake to 56.8mt and the coal inventory at thermal power stations declined 53.2 per cent YoY to 17.5mt in November 2021. ",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Mandi in Himachal Pradesh on Monday to inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of hydropower projects worth over Rs 11,000 crore. He will also preside over the second ground breaking ceremony of the Himachal Pradesh Global Investors' meet, the PMO said. Noting that Modi has constantly focussed on fully utilising the untapped potential of the resources available in the country, it said a step in this regard has been to utilise optimally the hydropower potential in the Himalayan region.  The projects which will be inaugurated and whose foundation stone will be laid by the Prime Minister during the visit reflect a key step in this direction,  it added. Modi will lay the foundation stone of the Renukaji dam project, which had been lying pending for around three decades. The project was made possible with Modi's thrust on cooperative federalism when the states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Delhi were brought together by the Centre for making the project possible. The 40 MW project will be built at a cost of around Rs 7,000 crore. It will prove to be immensely beneficial for Delhi, which will be able to receive around 500 million cubic metre water supply per year, the PMO said. Modi will also lay the foundation stone of the Luhri stage 1 hydro power project. The 210 MW project will be built at a cost of over Rs 1,800 crore. It will lead to generation of over 750 million units of electricity per year. The modern and dependable grid support will prove beneficial to surrounding states of the region as well. Another project for which he will lay the foundation stone is Dhaulasidh hydro power project. This will be the first hydropower project of Hamirpur district. The 66 MW project will be built at a cost of over Rs 680 crore. It will lead to generation of over 300 million units of electricity per year, the PMO said. Modi will inaugurate the Sawra-Kuddu hydro power project. The 111 MW project has been built at a cost of around Rs 2,080 crore. It will lead to generation of over 380 million units of electricity per year, and help the state earn revenue worth over Rs 120 crore annually. The Himachal Pradesh Global Investors' meet is expected to give a boost to investment in the region through the start of projects worth around Rs 28,000 crore, it added.",

The South Korean zinc giant's Australian clean energy arm Ark Energy said it would acquire 4.2 gigawatts (GW) of proposed wind and solar developments and a further investigation pipeline of 4.8 GW of projects through a takeover of Epuron Holdings. The companies did not disclose the acquisition price. Ark Energy was set up this year to decarbonise Korea Zinc's energy supply and says it aims to be the world's most competitive green hydrogen producer and eventually aims to export green hyodrgen from Australia to South Korea.  Ark Energy's commitment to accelerate the energy transition requires us to significantly enhance our capability to develop and build out a large renewable energy portfolio,  Korea Zinc Vice Chairman Yun Choi said in a statement. Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy to power electrolysers to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Ark Energy plans to speed up development of Epuron's large portfolio of projects. Ark earlier this year won nearly A$21 million ($15 million) in state and federal funding to start producing green hydrogen for fuel cell trucks at the company's Sun Metals zinc refinery in Queensland state.

Electric Vehicle penetration in India is expected to become a reality in the near future. As a result, Lithium-ion battery-based storage solutions will gain prominence, for both Automotive and Industrial applications,  the company's MD & CEO Subir Chakraborty said in a press release. Furthermore, the company said that it also plans to apply for and participate in the Production-Linked Incentive Scheme for National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) battery Storage, issued by the Ministry of Heavy Industries. The total outlay of the scheme announced by the Centre in August 2021 is Rs 18,100 crore for five years.  The scheme proposes a production linked subsidy based on applicable subsidy per KWh and percentage of value addition achieved on actual sales made by the manufacturers who set up production units. The PLI scheme will facilitate reduction of import dependence of ACC battery, which is imported presently,  the government had said.",

        "articleBody": "Indian Biogas Association (IBA) on Monday condemned the government for the withdrawal of subsidy on all kinds of biogas plants, saying it will impact India's goal of self-sufficiency in fossil fuels and affect 50 million farmers. Indian Biogas association condemns the government's decision on withdrawal of subsidy /CFA of all kinds of biogas plants- all categories- small, medium and bigger. The decision will impact almost 50 million farmers looking for energy security and natural farming along with the government's target of 5,000 plants under SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) Scheme and will jeopardize Indian dream of becoming self-sufficient in fossil fuels,  an IBA statement said.According to the statement, the Indian biogas industry can help government reduce Rs 1.1 lakh crore imports of fossil fuels, if the industry gets the right kind of support, which is impossible to achieve without support.The SATAT, an initiative of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) under the bio-fuel policy, targets to facilitate setting up 5,000 plants.This means subsidy requirement is of approximately Rs 20,000 crore (considering each plant of average 5 Tons/day bio-CNG output capacity), over a five-year period, it stated.The recently lapsed and withdrawn Central Financial Assistance (CFA) scheme for setting-up Biogas/CBG/bio-CNG projects- the scheme used to cover as much as Rs 4 crores/ MWel.eq. (max. up to Rs 10 crore per project), which roughly encompasses 15-25 per cent of the Capital Cost of a typical large-scale bio-CNG project/plant, it stated.Also, as per the notification dated February 28, 2020, in 2019-20, around Rs 478 crore for 257 MWeq. was allocated under the CFA grants.Unambiguously, this allocated amount was way too less than the CFA/subsidy needed to achieve the envisaged target under the SATAT initiative. The impact is well seen now in terms of withdrawal of CFA, it stated.",

        "articleBody": "American auto component maker Dana has said that India offers huge opportunities for the company in the EV space and it continues to invest in all its facilities depending upon the demand. The company earlier this year made a minority investment in Switch Mobility to develop electric vehicle (EV) drivetrains with Ashok Leyland's electric commercial vehicle arm. Dana has 18 facilities in India, which include joint ventures as well as a recently launched dedicated EV drivetrain manufacturing facility in Pune. ''We are extremely bullish on the high-voltage market. We believe that there is a huge opportunity to tap for Dana which is why investing in the electrification products and increasing our localisation to as much as 60-70 per cent,'' Gajanan Gandhe, country head-India at Dana, told PTI. It will help the company remain in the lead to support all the requirements coming in India, especially following the announcement of the PLI scheme that requires companies to localise and also invest up to a certain level, which Dana is doing, he said. Dana is a leader in electrification, especially in the high-voltage segment. Stating that it is quite optimistic about the growth in electrification, he said that even on the low-voltage side where Dana supplies to the two/three-wheelers and small commercial vehicle makers, it sees opportunity, especially in the last-mile mobility. ''We see a good opportunity (in these segments also), especially in the last-mile mobility,'' Gandhe added. He also said, ''We believe that switch starts to win businesses in India, we will be tagging along with them for most of the products that we can sell to them, whether it's motors, inverters, accelerator powertrain components.'' Dana has a strong lead, technology and localisation capability besides local talent to support the development of solutions for its customers and therefore, it sees electrification as a major opportunity for itself, Gandhe said. He also said the company is clear about which areas it wants to invest in, organically or inorganically, as it looks at factors such as the maximum demand growth opportunity, its competitive advantage in those areas in terms of the technology or its operations as well as its engineering capability. ''And, then obviously, we look at making capital investments in those areas. So, we have invested in most of our plants around India, whether it's in Pune for passenger vehicles, or in Noida, for off-highway vehicles or Sanad for small commercial vehicles (among others),'' Gandhe said. ''So, we continue to invest in all these facilities, where it makes sense for us to believe that there's a stronger market, and as well as we have a strong competitive advantage,'' he stated. Dana is a global leader in drivetrain, e-propulsion systems, supplies axles, driveshafts, transmissions, and electrodynamic, thermal, sealing, digital equipment for conventional, hybrid, and electric-powered vehicles.",

        "articleBody": "State-owned NHPC has plans to set up new hydro and solar projects of more than 27,000 MW capacity in nine states and neighbouring country Nepal, the company's CMD Abhay Kumar Singh said.  The new capacities would come up in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, Singh told PTI in an interview.  NHPC is in talks with some of these states which have shown interest in the projects. Others will also be engaged for the purpose, the CMD said.  Singh said that Nepal has also shown interest in hydro projects in joint venture with NHPC. Singh had met with the Nepal Prime Minister during his recent visit to that country.  When asked about fund availability for the projects, he said,  At present NHPC will not have a problem in making a capital expenditure of Rs 10,000 crore. We are in profit of about Rs 3,500 crore and it will increase further to Rs 5,000 crore substantially helping us to increase our capex to Rs 13,000 crore.   Speaking further, he said there were certain NHPC projects especially in the Northeast which were stalled for long. Efforts have been taken to resume them.  The 2,000 MW Subansiri lower hydroelectric project in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh is progressing well. In Dibang also, all hurdles have ended and the 2,880-MW dam project will begin soon.  NHPC is presently working on projects of total 6,000 MW capacity and another 9,000-10,000 MW is in the pipeline, Singh said.  He said the company will meet its target of 50,000 MW energy capacity which includes solar, within time.   We have made a break up of the target by 2025, 2030, 2040 how much capacity we have to install and accordingly we will be meeting our targets. And we will reach our goal within time,  the CMD said.  NHPC, under the Ministry of Power, is the largest hydro power company in India.",

The MoU was signed by the representatives of both the companies at Gandhinagar in the presence of Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, a state government release said, adding that the plant would produce 500-kilo litres of bioethanol per day. Bioethanol is an alternative to fossil fuel used in vehicles and a form of renewable energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks through microbial fermentation. This joint venture between state government-owned GACL and GAIL is another step towards realizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of an ''Atmanirbhar Bharat''. To reduce the import of crude oil and thereby save on foreign exchange, the Prime Minister has set a target of 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol by 2025, said the release. This plant will be using corn or rice husk as feedstock to produce 500 KLD (kiloliters per day) bioethanol, which will be used for blending in petrol. As by-products, the plant will also produce 135 KTPA (kilo tonnes per annum) protein-rich animal feed and 16.50 KTPA of corn oil, according to the release. The estimated project cost is Rs 1,000 crore, and it is expected to generate an annual turnover of Rs 1,500 crore, the release said, adding that the project would create employment opportunities for nearly 700 persons. As per the release, the plant will help India reduce crude imports and save USD 70 million per year in foreign exchange.",

        "articleBody": "Ram Charan Company, the Chennai-based chemicals-trader-turned-renewable energy specialist with focus on sustainable R&D, has bagged a USD 2.2 billion order from the Ghana-based Masri Company to supply waste to energy units that is expected to generate 300 MW of power in the African nation. Last month, the New York-based impact fund TFCC International had entered into an agreement with Ram Charan to pick up 46 per cent stake for USD 4.14 billion, valuing it at around USD 9 billion.  The deal was biggest in the domestic chemicals space and one of the biggest private equity deals across the industry in the country till date and it said the TFCC investment will go into developing new energy management systems and manufacture renewable energy devices with high storage capacity made from sodium silicate.  Ram Charan started off as a chemical distributor in 1965, and from 2016 it has moved into research on managing end-of-life chemicals, and since then has developed products that can process large quantities of unsegregated waste.  Later, it moved from chemicals trading and distribution into compound and specialty chemical manufacturing, as also testing and research, according to its website.  It has presence across the country apart from in Britain, North America and Japan.  The company is currently headed by third generation entrepreneurs Divyesh and Kaushik Palicha.  Since 2016, Ram Charan has moved into deep-tech, end-of-life chemicals converting unsegregated waste into energy and manufacturing new-generation energy storage devices - the primary reason for the American fund to go for such a high valuation and equity partnership.   We've bagged a USD 2.2-billion order Masri Company from Ghana, which is working in the energy and mostly renewable energy space and this is their first foray into the waste to energy business,  Kaushik Palicha, a director and part of the promoter family of Ram Charan, said in a statement on Friday.  The supply is expected to commence in November 2022, with setting up of units across Ghana over the next two years. The agreement and delivery of waste to energy products and services will be delivered under the brand name Entity One, he added.   This is our first agreement to supply waste to energy units and this USD 2.2 billion order goes well with our overall mission of processing bulk waste to energy without leaving behind any residue,  Palicha said.   We are confident that our waste to energy products and new generation energy storage devices will help the environment of Ghana in a significant manner,  he added.  Ram Charan's waste to energy technology allows for zero toxic residue, and can be used to convert all types of unsegregated of waste into energy, with zero residue to the environment, making it the first of its kind globally and also the safest.  Ram Charan is implementing modern techniques considering a zero part per million production unit, and is also amongst the first globally to set up end product responsibility for their products.  The technology, developed in-house after research from 2016 by the current team at Ram Charan headed by Palicha, has been branded under the name 'Entity One', and has a slew of products lined up for release from 2022 till 2024. Manufacturing facilities are planned in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.  Ram Charan started off as a chemical distributor and has of late moved to research based on managing end of life chemicals. It began research on these projects in 2016, and since then has proceeded to develop products which can process large quantities of unsegregated waste.",

NTPC has awarded a project of standalone Fuel-Cell based Micro-grid with hydrogen production using electrolyser in NTPC Guest House at Simhadri (near Visakhapatnam),  a power ministry statement said.  As per the statement, this will be India's first green hydrogen-based energy storage project and one of the largest in the world.  The ministry said that it would be a precursor to large-scale hydrogen energy storage projects and would be useful for studying and deploying multiple microgrids in various off grid and strategic locations of the country.  The hydrogen would be produced using the advanced 240 kW Solid Oxide Electrolyser by taking input power from the nearby Floating Solar project.  The hydrogen produced during sunshine hours would be stored at high pressure and would be electrified using a 50 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell.  The system would work in standalone mode from 5 PM in the evening to 7 AM in the morning, it stated.  This unique project configuration is designed in-house by NTPC. It is a unique project for India and would open doors for decarbonising the far-off regions of the country like Ladakh, J&K etc, hitherto dependent on diesel generators, it stated.  The project is in-line with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for becoming carbon neutral by 2070 and making Ladakh a carbon neutral territory, it stated.  NTPC's present installed capacity is 67,907.5 MW (including 13,425 MW through JVs/Subsidiaries) comprising 47 NTPC stations and 26 joint venture stations.",

In the last seven years, the installed nuclear power capacity grew from 4780 MW to 6780 MW, an increase of over 40 per cent,  Singh said.Responding to another question, the minister said the current annual production of uranium in the country is not enough to meet the annual fuel requirement of all the operational uranium based nuclear power plants. However, we are continuously exploring the possibility of alternate fuel based on thorium in this regard for which we have enough reserves. Further, the Department is importing uranium from different countries like Canada, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia also,  Singh said.The Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), a constituent unit of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), has the mandate to identify, evaluate and augment mineral resources of uranium, thorium, niobium, tantalum, beryllium, lithium, zirconium, titanium and rare earths containing uranium and thorium in the country, he said.

        "articleBody": "State-owned GAIL India Ltd plans to import India's first and the largest to date electrolyser for producing green hydrogen within a year and may look to hire another ship to ferry LNG from the US, officials said Tuesday.GAIL chairman and managing director Manoj Jain said his company had launched a global tender to procure a 10-megawatt electrolyser capable of producing 4.5 tonnes per day of hydrogen.Delivery of the electrolyser may happen in 12 to 14 months. Not just imports, we are also looking at domestic manufacturing of electrolyser. Our tender gives preference to domestic manufacturers,  he said.The company will install the electrolyser at one of its gas processing plants in the country. While the firm was initially looking at using natural gas as feedstock for producing what is known as blue hydrogen, it may look at using renewable energy to split water to produce oxygen and green hydrogen.While molecularly blue or green hydrogen is similar, the former has a carbon dioxide by-product and the latter is emission-free fuel.Jain said the hydrogen so produced can be sold to users such as fertiliser plants or mixed in CNG for sale to automobiles, helping cut emissions.The largest electrolyser currently announced in India is a 5-MW unit being installed by India's largest power utility NTPC at Vindhyachal in Uttar Pradesh.NTPC intends to power the electrolyser using a coal-fired super-thermal power station, in concert with carbon capture. Renewable electricity may potentially be used in the future, which would make it emissions-free, but no date has been set for when that could occur.Separately, GAIL Director (Finance) R K Jain said the company may look to hire a second LNG ship to ferry fuel from the US.The company in February this year hired from Japanese shipping major Mitsui O.S.K. Lines a 180,000 cubic meters vessel for five years and named it GAIL Bhuwan. This vessel was used to transport LNG from the US to Dabhol in Maharashtra earlier this month.GAIL has contracts for procuring LNG volumes from the USA under two long-term Sales and Purchase Agreements signed with US energy majors. We may look at hiring another vessel if there is demand,  Jain said.India is putting increased focus on hydrogen as an alternative fuel source to lower its carbon emissions, while also meeting its growing energy needs.Reliance Industries as well as Adani Group have announced ambitious green hydrogen plans.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani in September said Reliance was aiming to bring down the cost of producing green hydrogen to below USD 2 per kilogram, while it has set a stretch goal of bringing that cost down to under $1 per kilogram within 10 years as it targets 100 GW of renewable generation capacity by 2030.Green hydrogen currently costs USD 6 per kg.Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani too has unveiled a plan to invest USD 20 billion over the next decade in renewable energy generation and component manufacturing.In addition to setting a goal to become  the producer of the least expensive green electron anywhere in the world , Adani has said his company will become one of the largest green hydrogen producers in the world.

        "articleBody": "GIC of Singapore, ADIA and Orix Corp backed Greenko has set up a 50:50 joint venture with Belgium's John Cockerill for setting up a giga factory for electrolysers as part of its green hydrogen and ammonia manufacturing plans, joining the likes of Reliance Industries and Adani Group to set up such large scale facilities.John Cockerill, among the largest suppliers of high-capacity alkaline electrolyzers, developing 6+MW of such facilities across the globe, have signed an exclusive agreement with Greenko ZeroC (GZC), a subsidiary of Greenko Group, to jointly develop market initiatives for green hydrogen electrolyzers in India for local use and also for exports. Greenko will set up a 1 million tonnes per annum ammonia manufacturing plant for exports that will have a requirement of 2 gigawatts (GW) of electrolysers.Ammonia produced through clean tech can be used in fertiliser and chemicals industry. Currently, 2% of global fossil fuel is used to make ammonia. It is also the second largest chemical produced after sulphuric acid. Shipping industry is already moving towards using ammonia as a transportation fuel. This partnership will facilitate the production of the lowest cost green hydrogen by enabling delivery of electrolyzers at scale in India, within the next year, both companies said in a statement on Tuesday. In turn, this will support the faster adoption of a green molecule-related ecosystem in the country. Both companies, according to people in the know are looking at an $250 million capital investment towards the project which may come up in Telengana or Gujarat. The quantity of hydrogen consumed in India is currently 5-6 mtpa and replacing a quarter of that with green hydrogen will create a nascent domestic market with a supply chain that will create opportunities to substitute at least 3 mtpa of ammonia imports.",

Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen in electrolyser by using renewable-powered electricity. India has announced the National Hydrogen Mission to push green hydrogen.It is anticipated that green hydrogen demand in India for applications such as oil, refineries, steel and fertiliser units and city gas grids will grow up to 2 million metric tonnes per annum by 2030 in line with the nation\u2019s green hydrogen mission. This would call for investments upward of $60 billion, a joint statement said.Sinha said a number of opportunities are coming up in green hydrogen and the partnership will not be constrained by capital availability.He said the partnership will put together a special entity for each opportunity and put in a bid based on the combined strength of the companies.The partnership dynamics will vary depending on the clients and will be worked out on a case-to-case basis, Subrahmanyan said.L&T will separately be also pursuing other aspects of green hydrogen like electrolyzers and grid stationary batteries, he said.",

        "articleBody": "Steel production could be made with almost no carbon emissions through $278 billion of extra investment by 2050, according to a new report from research firm BloombergNEF (BNEF). According to the report titled \u2018Decarbonizing Steel: A Net-Zero Pathway\u2019, by 2050, green hydrogen could be the cheapest production method for steel and capture 31 per cent of the market. \u201cAnother 45 per cent could come from recycled material, and the rest from a combination of older, coal-fired plants fitted with carbon capture systems and innovative processes using electricity to refine iron ore into iron and steel,\u201d it said. The report added that this would be a dramatic shift in the type of furnaces and fuels used to produce steel. Today, about 70 per cent of steel is made in coal-fired blast furnaces, with 25 per cent produced from scrap in electric furnaces, and 5 per cent made in a newer, typically natural gas-fired process known as DRI, or direct reduced iron. Converting a significant portion of the fleet to hydrogen would require more DRI plants and more electric furnaces. Blast furnace production would fall to 18 per cent of capacity in this scenario.The report said that hydrogen and recycling will play a central role in reducing emissions from steel production. Steel is responsible for about 7 per cent of man-made greenhouse gas emissions every year and is one of the world\u2019s most polluting industries.\u201cThe steel industry cannot afford to wait for the 2040s to start its transition,\u201d said Julia Attwood, head of sustainable materials at BNEF and lead author of the report. Attwood added that the next 10 years could see a massive expansion of steel capacity to meet demand in growing economies, such as India. \u201cToday\u2019s new plants are tomorrow\u2019s retrofits. Commissioning natural gas-fired plants could set producers up to have some of the lowest-cost capacity by retrofitting them to burn hydrogen in the 2030s and 2040s\u201d she said. She, however, added that continuing to build new coal-fired plants will leave producers with only bad options toward a net-zero future by 2050.",

IREDA will assist BVFCL in developing an action plan to create and acquire renewable energy projects for the next five years.  Das said,  We are happy to associate with BVFCL, which is now committed to reducing carbon emissions from its operations and value chain. We believe this collaboration will inspire other companies of the chemical and fertiliser sector like BVFCL to cut carbon emissions and be environment-friendly.   He added that it is a way forward for IREDA to play a key role in the development of northeast India through green energy.  Das further said the MoU will support in contributing to achieving the government target of reducing its carbon emission to 45 per cent by 2030 in line with the commitment made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in CoP 26.  Recently, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said the country's total installed renewable energy capacity, including hydro, crossed 150 gigawatts (GW). Out of this, IREDA has supported over 19-GW RE installations in the country.  The MoU with BVFCL is the fifth one signed by IREDA in one year. Earlier, IREDA has signed pacts with SJVN, NHPC, TANGEDCO and NEEPCO to extend its techno-financial expertise for green energy projects.",

        "articleBody": "Cost-slashing innovations are underway in the electric power sector and could give electricity the lead over fossil-based combustion fuels in the world's energy supply by mid-century, according to Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)When combined with a global carbon price, these developments can catalyse emission reductions to reach the Paris climate targets, while reducing the need for controversial negative emissions, a new study finds. Today, 80 per cent of all energy demands for industry, mobility or heating buildings is met by burning - mostly fossil - fuels directly, and only 20 per cent by electricity. Our research finds that relation can be pretty much reversed by 2050, making the easy-to-decarbonise electricity the mainstay of global energy supply,  said Gunnar Luderer, author of the new study and researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research as well as professor of Global Energy Systems Analysis at the Technical University of Berlin.For the longest time, fossil fuels were cheap and accessible, whilst electricity was the precious and pricier source of energy, Luderer said. He stated how renewable electricity generation - especially from solar photovoltaics - has become cheaper at breath-taking speed, a pace that most computer simulations have so far underestimated. Over the last decade alone prices for solar electricity fell by 80 per cent, and further cost reductions are expected in the future. This development has the potential to fundamentally revolutionize energy systems. Our computer simulations show that together with global carbon pricing, green electricity can become the cheapest form of energy by 2050, and in the long-term supply up to three-quarters of all demand,  Luderer explained.",

        "articleBody": "By Thomas Sattich, University of Stavanger and Charis PalmerIn a small room in Delft, Netherlands, a group of engineering students ponder what energy systems might look like in 2050. Across the North Sea in Stavanger, Norway, students of international relations consider how the world order might shift if there were universal access to renewable energy.The engineers know little about geopolitics, the IR students little about energy technology.They're undertaking a green policy simulation: each represents a fictional country grappling with the energy transition and lays out how they would deliver it, balancing the interests of their citizens with those of the world. Some of the fictional countries are dependent on fossil fuels, others are blessed with abundant renewables.It's a useful tool to teach the complexity of trade-offs in energy transitions and emission reductions. How could the world order shift if countries not known for renewable energy production or export ended up dominating it?The energy transition's current darling, hydrogen, has moved from the world of engineering to politics. Governments around the world have already committed more than USD 70 billion to stimulate the hydrogen industry.Hydrogen production is moving from grey: using natural gas, to blue: with carbon capture, and green: produced by electrolysis using renewable electricity. Right now, green hydrogen isn't economically viable.If not for the world running out of time to stop catastrophic global warming, we wouldn't be talking as much about hydrogen. And in Europe at least, the electricity used to make hydrogen through electrolysis has to compete with electricity use for power purposes.Could hydrogen become the new oil? Energy analysts predict oil demand could peak soon after 2025, and by 2050, hydrogen could meet up to 24 per cent of the world's energy needs. Considering the dominant split of energy today - oil 30.9 per cent, coal 26.8 per cent and gas 23.2 per cent - a 24 per cent share is substantial enough to affect world order.Yet to work out how the geopolitics could play out it's worth asking three questions. One: how much hydrogen will countries use, two: how much will countries trade, and three: how fast will the change happen? Only then can you establish where hydrogen might fit in the global energy mix.The obvious early movers are heavy industry looking to decarbonise, industrial shipping and heavy vehicles. Large power utilities are eyeing it off for storage. All of these players are largely linked to the existing oil and gas industry.As countries transition to sustainable energy, oil and gas led economies could lose USD7 trillion by 2040, the International Energy Agency has warned. Hydrogen could give them a lifeline to extend their business model.Still, electricity is expected to be the energy carrier of the future, powering most other applications in a green world.Trade depends on domestic production capacity, cost differences between countries and strategic considerations. Consider mature countries that don't want to be reliant on electricity from their nearest neighbours: hydrogen imports could deliver the strategic diversification they're looking for. Hydrogen simply allows for more long-distance, more flexible, trade.An East Asian hydrogen market stretching between India, Japan and Australia is feasible. Similar markets could develop in the Americas or between the Middle East and Europe.For countries, four scenarios are likely as sustainable energy technology evolves. With the technology, opportunities open up for export of energy, know-how and materials.A fossil fuel exporter becomes a sustainable energy exporter - they win some and lose some.A fossil fuel exporter becomes a sustainable energy importer, a lose lose.A fossil fuel importer becomes a sustainable energy exporter, going from a position of dependence to revenue. A win win.And lastly, the position most countries now find themselves in, a fossil fuel importer misses the opportunity and moves to being a sustainable energy importer.It's a high risk, high reward scenario for governments betting on green hydrogen ahead of it being economically viable. Then again, invest too little too late and they risk wasting money while still ending up a laggard.The only certainty is that not every country will benefit equally from the transition, and those losing might not be the usual suspects.The authors are with 360info in Stavanger.",

        "articleBody": "Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) will soon float a tender for a 20 MW electrolyser to build the country\u2019s largest green hydrogen plant as it aims to achieve net-zero emissions for its operations by 2040, its chairman Arun Kumar Singh has said. BPCL is working out the details and aims to firm up its net-zero roadmap by next March, Singh told ET in an interview. \u201cIt will cover all our operations, including refineries, pipelines, depots, and bottling plants, but will not include customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 emissions,\u201d he said.Climate change concerns have pushed most major economies and several companies to set a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target for themselves. Oil majors BP and Shell plan to turn net-zero by 2050 while Reliance Industries, India\u2019s largest company by market value, has set a target to achieve this feat by 2035. BPCL currently uses 650 MW of energy, including 550 MW of grid power and internal gas turbine generation power, which is expected to rise to 1,000 MW by 2027, after factoring in green hydrogen obligation. The company aims to meet the entire 1,000 MW requirement using renewable sources, Singh said.BPCL will put up 20 MW electrolyser at its refinery in Bina, Madhya Pradesh to produce green hydrogen. This will be double the size of GAIL\u2019s recent tender for 10 MW electrolyser, the largest so far. \u201cThe 20 MW electrolyser is a pilot for us,\u201d Singh said. \u201cWe will not wait until long to float another tender for capacity expansion. As costs come down, we will seek more electrolysers, probably much bigger than this.\u201d He said BPCL\u2019s progress on green hydrogen will also depend on the way the government policy shapes up, especially the mandate on the use of green hydrogen by refiners. \u201cOur investment in green hydrogen will depend on the evolution of tech, cost and government policy.\u201d Green hydrogen should make up 10% of the overall hydrogen requirements of refiners in three years, increasing to 25% by the end of the decade, as per a government proposal.\u201cWhile our refineries in Mumbai or Kochi may have space constraints, Bina has ample space to accommodate enough green hydrogen making capacity to meet the mandate for the entire company,\u201d the company chairman said.Due to space constraints at many refineries, state-run oil companies have urged the government to impose an overall green hydrogen use mandate for each company, rather than for each refinery site. BPCL is also preparing itself for a future when electric vehicles are expected to become popular and eat into fuel sales. The company aims to set up 7,000 EV charging stations over the next few years. Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL together plan to set up 22,000 EV charging stations, about a quarter of the current fleet of 80,000 petrol pumps. ",

Total income for H1FY22 was \u20b93,811.9 crore, up 26% over the same period a year ago.  We remain on track to deliver our previously announced guidance,  said Sumant Sinha, founder chairman and chief executive officer.  As of today, we have 7 GW operating, up from 6.3 GW we had operating on September 30, 2021 and we have about 400 MW scheduled to be commissioned in the next couple of weeks.   We continue to believe that we will be able to deliver our aspirational goal of 18 GW operational by end of FY25. Sinha said the portfolio is fully equity funded and the company does not need more external equity for the 18 GW target.  Our cash flow generation should self fund 2.5-3.0 GW of growth annually without raising external equity. We will consider options in the future to recycle capital that could increase growth, improve returns and reduce risk,  he said. ",

        "articleBody": "Far from Glasgow, in the coal hub of Ranchi in eastern India, labour union leader D. D. Ramanandan followed the COP26 climate summit closely, scanning tweets by experts and news reports to check for any imminent  threat to coal  in his country.So when India, along with other coal-reliant nations like China, pushed successfully to water down language on efforts to ditch coal power at the talks, drawing criticism, Ramanandan saw it as an opportunity to plan a better green transition. I followed (the) COP to see if India pledges for transition because then the process will begin here and it will impact workers, land users, entire towns and villages. This is a big issue,  said Ramanandan, general secretary of the All India Coal Workers Federation. Local communities still don't believe a future beyond coal is possible. But we need to prepare ourselves,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. It is important to control carbon emissions and coal will end - if not in 20, then 50 years,  he added.The two-week U.N. climate talks in Scotland ended on Saturday with a deal targeting fossil fuels for the first time.But India, backed by China, South Africa, Nigeria and Iran, rejected a clause urging a  phase out  of unabated coal-fired power - which is not fitted with technology to reduce carbon emissions - and secured a change in the text for a  phase-down . How can anyone expect that developing countries can make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when developing countries have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication?,  India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav told the conference.Most just transition experts and unions backed India's stance at the summit, saying the country  had no choice . Fossil fuels account for more than 60% of India's installed power capacity, with coal accounting for over half.Sanjay Vashist, director of Climate Action Network South Asia, said the Glasgow Climate Pact reflected the interests of rich, powerful governments aiming to pass the burden of dropping coal to developing nations while leaving oil and gas untouched. There will be pressure in the future to phase out coal. It is a wake-up call for India and it should hear it loud and clear - that the phase out will have an impact on communities,  he said. India has not thought about energy transition,  he added.  Coal mines being closed in India are not because of climate change but because they are no longer profitable. LONG ROAD AHEADIndia started on a strong green footing at COP26 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions in 2070 and boost the share of renewables in India's energy mix from about 38% last year to 50% by 2030.But analysts noted coal remains a dominant energy source in India, accounting for 70% of its electricity output.After China, India is the world's second-largest coal producer at about 730 million tonnes annually - yet also imports coal to meet the power needs of its domestic industries, according to the government.Days before COP26, a coal shortage in India made headlines as inventories hit critically low levels amid surging industrial demand after the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and high global coal prices led buyers to shun imports.India is easing its mining laws to attract foreign players to its domestic coal sector and reduce imports.The government has yet to back economic diversification in coal hubs, where decades of mining have shrunk farmland and polluted water and air, while offering fewer local jobs than expected. Communities living in mining areas are already suffering more than they should. And yet very high dependency on coal for income - both legally and illegally - continues,  said Ravi Rebbapragada, chair of Mines, Minerals and People, an alliance of communities and institutions affected by mining. The ideal situation would be to phase out coal, but there are no simple solutions,  he said, adding a start could be made by ensuring strict compliance with laws on operating mines.That would help mitigate both the climate change threat and the suffering of communities affected by coal mining, he added.EXTREME WEATHERThe Glasgow summit sparked a dialogue back in India on the unfair burden being placed on the coal-dependent nation whose per-capita emissions remain far below richer countries.But experts also noted how cutting coal could benefit India. Emissions also affect us,  said Rohit Azad, who teaches economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, pointing to the huge population along India's coast that is most vulnerable to extreme weather events. We are doing it for ourselves,  he said.The Global Climate Risk Index 2021, a ranking from research group Germanwatch, put India among the top 10 countries most affected by climate change.The South Asian nation is experiencing rising heat and sea levels, as well as erratic rainfall and stronger cyclones.Many of its poorest people, such as small farmers, are finding it harder to cope with the losses and damage caused by increasingly severe weather, researchers say. At COP26, India said it had achieved a 24% cut in the emissions intensity of its gross domestic product between 2005 and 2014.The country must now use the extra time it managed to secure in Glasgow for weaning itself off coal in order to attract new industries to mining hubs and provide alternative livelihood options for local communities, experts said.Labour leader Ramanandan foresees consensus gradually building to end coal use in India, alongside an expansion of campaigns to protect the livelihoods of coal-dependent people.Meanwhile, investing in new economic opportunities in coal hubs will be a critical pre-condition for a just transition that leaves no one behind, to persuade workers to sign up for a green future beyond fossil fuels, experts said. There will be a huge resistance, unless they see alternatives,  Srestha Banerjee, climate justice programme head at the iFOREST think-tank, told a podcast this week.",

        "articleBody": "Hinduja group flagship Ashok Leyland is working on hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles and a team is currently engaged in developing them, a top official said on Monday. For the time being, the company would stick to the Rs 750 crore earmarked for taking up the capital expenditure plan this financial year.  We are working very closely on hydrogen-powered CVs (commercial vehicles) At this point of time, we do not want to talk more about it. We are deeply engaged and a team is currently working on it,  Ashok Leyland CEO and MD Vipin Sondhi told reporters. The company has drawn up plans to roll out CNG-fitted commercial vehicles that are expected to hit the roads during the fourth quarter of this financial year. Ashok Leyland CFO Gopal Mahadevan, responding to a query on whether the company was would invest more than the Rs 750-crore capex as was announced earlier or whether will look at revising it, said,  I think we will stay with that number (Rs 750 crore) at the moment . To a query on exports, Sondhi said the company was looking at having a greater play in the African market.  Our traditional markets have been SAARC, Middle-East, Nepal and Sri Lanka. As we move forward, you will see us having a greater play in Africa. I think the fleet we have is larger, more comprehensive both in left-hand and right-hand drive (markets),  he said. Expanding into the African market would be crucial, Sondhi said. He further said the company would look at South-East Asian markets too. In Africa, we have laid out a retail distribution channel,  he said. To a query on the used vehicle segment, Mahadevan said the company would use the digital platform in a big way and not just the traditional way of buying and selling a used vehicle.  What we are going to do is to use digital in a big way in catering to this segment and not just traditional way of buying and selling used vehicles,  he said. To another query on the total debt, Mahadevan said it was Rs 3,112 crore as on date and sequentially about Rs 1,000 crore was reduced on the back of exemplary work done by the management to reduce the debt levels.",

The company will primarily use the proceeds to refinance existing debt at the special purpose vehicle (SPV) level as well as fund future acquisitions.  VRET has also tied up an additional Rs 1,000 crore of long-term financing from L&T Finance. This ensures complete debt tie-up for VRETs immediate near-term acquisition pipeline, the company said.  Further, VRET has availed a working capital facility of Rs 150 crore from Tata Capital to enhance its liquidity position and meet its credit rating requirements.   This incredible achievement is an important milestone in VRET's journey, demonstrating our debt fund raising capabilities at competitive pricing with different instruments and maturity profiles and reposing the faith of lenders in VRET,  Sanjay Grewal, CEO, Virescent Infrastructure said in the statement.  Grewal further added that  we look forward to working closely with our lenders as we continue to acquire high-quality assets for achieving our initial growth targets.   VRET has expanded its Board and has appointed Akshay Jaitly as an independent director, a company statement said.   We are extremely happy to induct Akshay Jaitly on our Board and we will benefit from his legal/regulatory knowledge and experience in the infrastructure and renewable sectors,  Grewal said.  The other Independent Directors include Pradeep Kumar Panja, CMD - Karnataka Bank and Member - Bank Board Bureau and Vinay Kumar Pabba, former CEO of Brookfield Renewables and Ex-COO of Greenko.  Jaitly is the President of 262 Advisors, based in Paris. He advises Indian, French and other international businesses with an interest in India on cross-border strategy and risk management. He is also involved with research initiatives on policy reform in the Indian power and infrastructure sectors.  Jaitly previously worked as a transactional lawyer for over 25 years, in the UK, Japan and India.  In 2000, he co-founded Trilegal and was the head of their energy and infrastructure practice. He remains senior advisor to Trilegal and is a member of their Board.  Recently, in September 2021, VRET was set-up as a private listed InvIT and raised around USD 62 million of equity from a group of foreign and domestic investors, led by Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCO).",

        "articleBody": "Toyota Motor Corp said on Saturday it will partner with four other Japanese vehicle makers to explore the viability of alternative green fuels for internal combustion engine cars, including hydrogen and synthetic fuels derived from biomass.The companies, which in addition to Toyota include Mazda Motor Corp, Subaru Corp, Yamaha Motor and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, made the announcement at a race track in Okayama, western Japan, where Toyota is racing a hydrogen car.The hydrogen race car is being driven by Toyota chief eexcutive Akio Toyoda along with other Toyota drivers.Converting internal combustion engines to green fuels such as hydrogen is technologically difficult, but doing so would allow the companies to support decades-old existing supply chains employing hundreds of thousands of workers that they may otherwise have to drop as they switch to building electric vehicles (EV).As nations tighten environmental regulations to cut carbon emissions, automakers including Toyota, are ramping up production of EVs. Japan has said it aims to be carbon neutral by 2050 and is promoting the use of hydrogen fuel.Toyota plans for 15 EV models by 2025 and is investing $13.5 billion over the next decade to expand battery production capacity. At the same, time however, it is continuing to develop vehicles powered by hydrogen.",

The proceeds would be used to ramp up generation of non-conventional power. Feelers have gone to alternative energy focused financial investors, pension and sovereign asset managers and big ticket private equity firms, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told ET. \u201cWe have launched a formal process. With the current traction toward green energy assets, we hope to get better traction for the subsidiary,\u201d said one of the sources cited above. The company has hired Morgan Stanley to run a formal process. Emails sent to JSW Group remained unanswered. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. This fundraising will be in addition to a $700-million green bond, which JSW Hydro Energy raised earlier this year for its projects. The company has renewable businesses including hydro, wind and solar, which collectively form about 30 percent of the power business. Going forward, the share of thermal is likely to go down with rising volumes of renewable power generations. 87616738By financial year 2025, renewables are estimated to be over two-third of the portfolio with thermal power reducing to 32 percent, show an investor presentation by JSW Energy. The company projects an 18 percent CAGR growth in power generation until FY30. It has a total capacity of 4.6 GW with over one-third of it coming from non-conventional energy. Total capacity is anticipated to be 20GW by FY30 as green energy is likely to emerge as the flagship business with 84 percent share. During the September quarter, JSW Energy reported a 3.69 percent fall in its consolidated net profit to Rs 339 crore. On a comparable basis, adjusting for exceptional finance cost, profit after tax (PAT) stood at Rs 414 crore as compared with the reported PAT (consolidated net profit) of Rs 352 crore in the corresponding period last year. In the recent past, India has seen the renewable energy expansion driven by large corporate groups and private equity-backed energy platforms, aiming to tap increasing appetite toward non-carbon fuel resources. Earlier, French oil and gas major Total SE picked up a stake in Adani Green. In October, Reliance Industries has bought out Norway-based solar panel manufacturer REC Solar Holdings for around $771 million and acquired 40% stake in Shapoorji Pallonji Group\u2019s Sterling & Wilson Solar. Sterling & Wilson Solar as well as REC. PE funds and strategic investors have pumped in $70 billion in renewable energy across the country in the past seven years, power minister RK Singh has said in June. At present, India\u2019s installed renewable energy capacity is about 95 GW, including 40.5 GW of solar power. Capacity addition is expected to be 10.5-11 GW in financial year 2021-22, led by a strong project pipeline of about 38 GW, according to ratings firm ICRA. The sector is expected to witness investments of Rs 3.5 lakh crore over the next four years, increasing its share to 34% of the overall installed power generation capacity by March 2025 from 25% in March 2021, led by the solar power segment, ICRA said in a report.",

        "articleSection": "Industry",
        "articleBody": "When it comes to saving the planet, the ambition of India\u2019s reach is praiseworthy. The challenge lies in the weakness of its grasp.After emphasizing for years that a pathway to going green was more important than a deadline, India surprised delegates at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow by announcing a net zero goal for emissions by 2070. More onerous than that longer-term commitment is the intention to use non-fossil-fuel sources for half of its energy needs by 2030.It\u2019s a daunting target. The share of renewables in the country\u2019s current energy mix is only 12%. Besides, the third-largest emitter would guzzle 2.5 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually by 2030, almost double what it required at the start of the decade.Still, the world\u2019s lowest-cost solar and second-lowest-cost wind producer can deliver on its pledge, provided a 6 trillion rupees ($80 billion) hole in the heart of the country\u2019s power system can be filled.That\u2019s the quantum of accumulated financial liabilities at India\u2019s electricity distribution companies, or discoms. This large overhang crimps their ability to pay on time, forcing them to run up operational debt to electricity suppliers and transmission firms. According to the most recent government data, discoms\u2019 payment arrears are now nearly $14 billion, almost a fifth of which are claims of renewable power producers.In most of India\u2019s 28 states, these utilities are controlled by local governments. A 22.3% \u201ctechnical and commercial loss\u201d \u2014 euphemism for free electricity to farmers and power theft \u2014 means that the distribution firms never quite manage to find their footing, despite several restructuring attempts. Their shaky financial position hurts generators, including clean-energy firms. Many discoms now have outstanding dues of between six and 12 times their monthly bills.Without reforming this bankrupt industry, India will struggle to meet its bold target of raising non-fossil-fuel generation capacity \u2014 including hydroelectric and nuclear power \u2014 to 500 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 150 gigawatts now.But that\u2019s easier said than done. During last year\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi provided $17 billion in emergency liquidity support to discoms to prevent them from defaulting. Since New Delhi was loathe to ratchet up public debt, it relied on a couple of public-sector financiers to do the job. They borrowed and funneled the money to the utilities to pay suppliers \u2014 including the state-owned NTPC Ltd., the country\u2019s No. 1 power producer.However, the catch was that state governments had to guarantee the concessional loans taken by their discoms. According to ICRA Ltd., the Indian affiliate of Moody\u2019s Investors Service, seven states extended almost $14 billion in such guarantees. Technically, these are contingent liabilities, though in practice they\u2019re proving to be very real. Recently, when power distributors in three states couldn\u2019t pay their arrears to NTPC, the Reserve Bank of India intervened and deducted money from their governments\u2019 accounts at the RBI.This is a pass-the-parcel game, where a higher branch of the government lends to entities controlled by a lower branch, and then gets bills of its own producer paid. Private-sector investors, who must do the heavy lifting for India to hit its clean-energy goals, won\u2019t be getting these favors: They will have to run around to get paid even as state politicians threaten to renegotiate long-term power purchase agreements.How then to reform discoms? Better software and demand-management systems may boost their ability to absorb renewables, as Sumant Sinha, chairman of ReNew Energy Global Plc, one of India\u2019s biggest producers of clean electricity, told Bloomberg News last month. However, efficiency gains alone won\u2019t address the problem of being stuck with older vintages of more expensive power purchase deals. \u201cUtilities which enjoy superior contracts will have cheaper power \u2014 it has less to do with management skills,\u201d says energy analyst Rahul Tongia at the New Delhi-based Centre for Social and Economic Progress. An overdue change may be to move wholesale demand away from long-term agreements to spot power exchanges, which today handle only about 5% of electricity consumed in India. Giving retail consumers more choice by allowing multiple distribution companies to share the wires and poles appears attractive in theory, though as a government think tank noted recently, it\u2019s not necessary that an open market will be more competitive. Even in Mumbai, which has a long tradition of private power supply, consumers who want to switch suppliers face heavy regulatory charges, making migration unviable. The biggest bottleneck is perverse incentives. As long as free electricity for pumping groundwater remains a popular ploy to garner farmers\u2019 votes, politicians won\u2019t want to lose control of discoms, not when they know that a federal government bailout will inevitably arrive every few years. But without a modicum of political will to depoliticize power, the promise of India\u2019s renewables industry may disappear in the country\u2019s $80 billion distribution ditch. ",

Adani Electricity has already taken steps to reduce Mumbai's carbon footprint. With a major thrust on promoting renewable energy, Adani will fulfill over 30 per cent of Mumbai's power requirements through renewable energy sources, which would further be scaled up to 60 per cent by 2027,  a company statement said. This will offset up to 16 per cent of Mumbai's total GHG (green house gases) emissions and make Mumbai one of the World's first Metropolis to be powered by such a significant share of renewable energy, the statement said. The company has linked these targets with financial penalty for non-achievement under its recent issuance of US Dollar denominated Bond to international investors, demonstrating commitment. A company spokesperson said that Adani Electricity Mumbai uses three to five per cent of power requirement of the city using renewable energy sources.Adani Electricity is also offering sustainable lifestyle options to its consumers, enabling them to contribute to fighting climate change and in reducing their individual carbon footprint. A Green Tariff has been rolled out wherein consumers can opt for supply from renewable energy sources. It is also offering a subsidy of up to 40 per cent to promote solar rooftop installations. More than 30,000 consumers have opted for these initiatives displacing equivalent of more than 26,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, equivalent to planting 850,000 trees. Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd, part of the diversified Adani Group, is an integrated business of power generation, transmission, and retail electricity distribution.",

        "articleBody": "The biggest green warrior on Wall Street might soon partner with one of India's most trusted conglomerates. BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink is closing in on an investment of $500-750 million (\u20b93,750-5,625 crore) in Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd (TPREL), said people with knowledge of the matter. That will value the subsidiary of listed Tata Power at around $5 billion (around \u20b935,000 crore), said people aware of the development. Fink was among the earliest champions of climate change and sustainability linked investment; BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager.ET was the first to report, on September 22, about Tata Power restarting capital-raising plans, mandating investment bank Moelis, nearly six months after pulling out of talks with Malaysian state-owned energy giant Petronas for a potential $2 billion investment. Due Diligence on  Canadian pension fund CPPIB was another potential investor that was evaluating the investment opportunity. But BlackRock's chunky valuation of the business-buoyed by a $1 billion investment by TPG Rise in Tata Motors' electric vehicle business - has made it a stronger contender to be the main anchor investor, said the people cited above.Due diligence has begun after the initial screening of potential investors. The company is looking to close negotiations by December-end. Depending on investor appetite, the company may increase its capital-raising plans to $1 billion with multiple smaller co-investors.    87476000 As with the private equity group, BlackRock has dedicated pools of capital for clean tech and green energy investments. BlackRock's third global renewable power fund raised $4.8 billion - almost double its initial target - to invest in assets around the world, drawing money from over 100 institutional investors, it said in April. Tata Power declined to comment. Tata Sons and BlackRock didn't respond to queries.Unlike the previous attempt that sought to create an infrastructure investment trust comprising the generating green assets, this time funds are being raised for an entity that groups the entire renewables portfolio. This entity will include operating and pipeline independent power producer (IPP) assets, charging stations, rooftop solar, microgrids, panel manufacturing, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC). For instance, Tata Power Solar is a 100% subsidiary of the wholly owned TPREL.Experts also see this as a potential value-unlocking and valuation-benchmarking exercise before an eventual listing.Tata Power, the country's largest integrated power company, has a stated plan to phase out coal-based capacity and expand its clean and green capacity to 80% by FY30. Renewable energy comprises almost a third of its total power capacity of 13 GW. The management hopes to increase this share exponentially to 80% by 2030, as per the management's commentary, to improve its environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings and increase its appeal to overseas investors. Since January, it has commissioned or received letters of intent for solar projects with a capacity of over 1 GW.  The company has the potential to be India's NextEra Energy, as it expertly straddles stable distribution and high growth renewable businesses,  said Apoorva Bahadur of Investec.Analysts said the company is increasingly looking at a holistic strategy across the clean energy business spectrum like solar module manufacturing, solar pumps and electric vehicle (EV) charging that provides growth options and helps position it as an integrated renewables player. Investors have endorsed the shift - the Tata Power stock has appreciated 125% in the past six months, while the BSE Power Index has gone up 36.5% in the same period.One of the key growth strategies is to focus on sunrise areas that are less capital intensive but gaining traction, such as solar EPC and pumps, transmission and distribution and the value chain of renewable businesses. Besides, the company is gradually moving into the business-to-consumer (B2C) value chain via electric vehicle charging stations and home automation, among others. In solar for example, Tata Power has built a presence along the entire value chain - module and cell manufacturing, EPC and operations and maintenance (O&M) - for competitive advantage. The company also has a presence in upcoming battery storage technology and in August won the tender for the country's first large-scale battery storage project at Ladakh, rated at 50 MWh.Tata Power is also one of the frontrunners in solar-wind hybrid power and market leader in solar rooftops. In April, Tata Power Solar doubled manufacturing capacity at its Bengaluru facility to 1.1 GW, and has been looking to tap into the government's Rs 4,500 crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for solar modules. It submitted a bid to expand its cell and module manufacturing capacity to 4 GW, if the government's initiatives come through. For its EV play, Tata Power is leveraging the entire group to manage network access, billing, time of day (TOD) tariffs and others. While the market is still evolving, the overall opportunity size could be $3-5 billion over the next seven-eight years, assuming penetration of 30%, believe industry players.This pivot coincides with the overall clean energy surge triggered by a combination of the decline in capital cost, technological advancements and political commitment toward climate change, making it the preferred choice for incremental capacity globally.The balance sheet too has been broadly mended with restructuring and divestments, analysts said, giving a further boost to the stock. Net debt at the end of September was Rs 39,719 crore, of which Rs 13,733 crore is on account of the renewables business. Parent Tata Sons also invested $350 million in the company. Last week, the company posted a 36% jump in consolidated net profit for the September quarter on the back of higher revenues.  The Q2 results of Tata Power (TPCL) manifest strong traction towards clean energy businesses and a head start with leadership status across,  said Swarnim Maheshwari of Edelweiss. ",

        "articleBody": "State-owned power giant NTPC has placed an order of 9,30,000 tonnes of biomass pellets for co-firing in power plants that will help improve air quality, said the power ministry. Besides, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are procuring 13,01,000 tonnes of biomass pellets for co-firing in their power plants, the power ministry said in a statement issued on Sunday.  Power Secretary Alok Kumar had taken review meeting on the status of biomass co-firing in the thermal power plants on October 28.  The meeting was attended by Central Electricity Authority, NTPC CMD, representatives from Punjab, Haryana and UP, mission director of the National Bio Mission, and senior officials of the power ministry.  It emerged in the meeting that as a result of various actions taken by the power ministry, initiatives for procurement of biomass have been taken up by NTPC and different states, it stated.  NTPC placed an order for 8,65,000 tonnes of biomass pellets, for which supply is already in progress.  Further, NTPC has placed an additional order of 65,000 tonnes in October 2021.  Another tranche of procurement by NTPC for 25 lakh tonnes is in progress, for which the vendors are invited to submit the offer by November 1, it stated.  The ministry stated that Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are together procuring about 13,01,000 tonnes of biomass pellets for co-firing in their power plants.  The orders are expected to be finalised in November 2021, it added.  In this context earlier, the Ministry of Power on November 17, 2017, issued a policy on biomass utilisation for power generation through co-firing in coal-based power plants.  In this earlier policy, it was advised that coal-based thermal power plants, except those having a ball tube mill, endeavour to use a 5-10 per cent blend of biomass pellets made primarily of agro residue along with coal after assessing the technical feasibility, such as safety aspect.  To further support the energy transition in the country and to achieve the target of cleaner energy sources, the policy has been modified and issued on October 8, 2021.  This modified policy will provide the necessary direction in achieving the desired goals, it said.  The Revised Policy for Biomass Utilisation for Power Generation through co-firing in coal-based power plants provides that for projects set up under Section 62 of the Electricity Act, 2003, the increase in cost due to co-firing of biomass pellets shall be pass through in energy charge rate (ECR).  For projects set up under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003, the increase in ECR due to biomass co-firing can be claimed under the change in law provisions, it said.  Such additional impact on ECR shall not be considered in deciding merit order despatch (MOD) of the power plant.  Obligated entities, such as discoms, can meet their renewable purchase obligations (RPO) by buying such generation of co-firing, it added.  The Ministry of Power has already set up the National Mission on use of Biomass in coal-based thermal power plants, to address the issue of air pollution due to farm stubble burning and to reduce carbon footprints of thermal power generation.  The mission is fully functional and taking various steps to encourage and support the biomass co-firing in the thermal power plants.  The mission is taking steps for the development of the biomass supply chain, sensitising stakeholders and encouraging budding entrepreneurs. Recently, two training and awareness programmes were organised at Faridabad, Haryana and Nangal, Ropar, this month.  Both programmes witnessed active participation by the farmers in the region wherein they were sensitised on the negative impact of crop residue burning on the soil productivity and avenues to supplement their income by participating in the value chain of biomass co-firing in thermal power plants.  More such training programmes are planned in the near future. Further, large-scale advertising and media campaigns are also being done regarding the benefit of eco-friendly utilisation of biomass in thermal power plants, it added.  As a result of these efforts, around 1,400 tonnes of biomass have been fired in October 2021, and a total of 53,000 tonnes of biomass has been utilised as green fuel in power plants so far.  Stubble burning incidences in the most-affected six states like Punjab, Haryana, UP, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have reduced by 58.3 per cent in 2021 till date as compared to the same period of 2020, it added.",

        "articleBody": "Solar Energy Corporation of lndia Ltd (SECI) is likely to float a tender in November for installation of 1,000 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) as a pilot project following overwhelming response to expression of interest in this regard, a senior official said. Earlier in October, SECI had called for the expression of interest (EOI) for procurement of 1,000 MWh BESS.  A stakeholder consultation was held jointly by the Ministry of Power, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy and SECI, on October 28, 2021, under the chairmanship of power secretary.   The meeting witnessed a huge participation from various stakeholders, ranging from battery manufacturers, system integrators and financing agencies, underscoring the fact that the Government of lndia has taken the steps in the right direction towards fulfilling the ambitious target of 450 GW of renewable energy capacity installation by 2030,  the official told PTI.  Around 300 participants had registered for the meeting and more than 250 participants attended the same, hosted by SECI on a virtual platform.  The official said that SECI is likely to float a tender for installation of 1,000 MWh BESS in November.  The participants, encompassing significant project developers, OEMs (original equipment manufactures) as well as Gigawatt manufacturers were welcomed by the power secretary, who highlighted the key aspects of the government guidelines and the immediate road map outlined by the union power minister for installation of 4,000 MWh of Battery Energy Storage Systems in lndia over the next few years, he added.  The meeting on October 28, 2021, was moderated by SECI and gave a short presentation, briefing the participants about the key aspects of the guidelines (for procurement and utilisation of BESS as a part of generation, transmission and distribution assets and with all ancillary services) and draft tender documents.  The presentation was followed by a fruitful deliberation on the primary aspects of the project, broadly covering the project location, performance criteria, applicability of relevant Regulations, etc, the official stated.  The prospective bidders were assured of full cooperation and facilitation by the government agencies, as the success of this pilot capacity of 1,000 MWh is important to pave the way for rapid deployment of large scale standalone BESS capacity in the country, he informed.  The concerns of participants related to the draft guidelines (for procurement and utilisation of BESS as a part of generation, transmission and distribution assets and with all ancillary services) and tender documents were duly noted, with few of them being addressed during the meeting itself.  The participants were asked to submit their queries/suggestions on the draft documents by writing to the SECI, latest by November 7, 2021, he stated.  Based on the comments received, the guidelines will be finalised and issued soon after, followed by publishing of the tender documents by SECI, he further said.",

        "articleBody": "As many as seven ethanol plants will be set up in Assam, responding to state government's policy seven units with investment of Rs 1500 crore to Rs 2000 crore will be come up in the state. Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the petroleum ministry is working to provide relief from increasing fuel prices, if the trend continues the state government will provide relief by reducing tax.  Sarma said that earlier the state government has reduced taxes on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 per litre.  He said, \u201cIf we need to reduce taxes further to give relief to the people of Assam, we will do that. But I do not want to do it on the basis of one month's result. If the high rates persist for a long time, then we will want to give relief. We do not want extra money.\u201d Sarma pointed out that the union petroleum minister is working on it. \u201cIf at all the state government has to do something, we will do it. I want to assure the people of Assam that I do not want extra tax. If this continues, whatever rebate we will have to give we will give. \u201cBut the tax collection in Assam is not much. We will try to reduce the tax as per our capacity. What we can do to help is we can let go of the extra tax that we get if prices of fuel are increased,\u201d he added.  Assam has got 14 proposals to set up rice-bran based ethanol plants for blending them with fuel.  Sarma said, \u201cSeven units will come up. We will have an MoU signing ceremony soon. These are the biggest investments we got immediately after our government came to power\u201d.",

An additional 90 MW of solar projects are under implementation in Gujarat. Vector Green had expanded its portfolio in 2019 by acquiring about 225 MW solar generation capacity from RattanIndia.Recently, Vector Green Energy had raised \u20b91,100 crore of loans from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) to fund its operating solar projects.Vector Green Energy has been awarded the rating of AAA by Crisil for its select group of solar power generating plants aggregating 356 MW.The most significant attribute of this portfolio is that 97% of the capacity is contracted with the best off-takers of the country viz. SECI and NTPC, through 25 year fixed- tariff power purchase agreements, said a Crisil report.GIP is one of the world's largest infrastructure-focused investors that manages over $71 billion (\u20b95.3 lakh crore) of assets including over 15GW of renewable projects. GIP entered India in 2018 by acquiring infrastructure asset management business from IDFC Alternatives.In July, GIP had sold Highway Concessions One (HC1), its India road platform consisting of seven highway assets with a total length of 487 kms, to global PE fund KKR at an enterprise value of \u20b93,500 crore.Another global infrastructure investor Actis is also launching a formal process to sell its Indian clean energy platform Sprng Energy. Actis has mandated Bank of America to sell the platform, which currently has an operational portfolio of 1.7 GW.",

        "articleBody": "The Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), which is world's first fully solar powered airport, has now ventured into hydro power production and plans to provide power from its plant at Arippara near Kozhikode to the KSEB from November first week. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the plant which estimates an annual power generation of 14 million unit, on November 6, CIAL authorities said on Sunday. CIAL said the 4.5 MWp run off the river small hydro project (SHP) was awarded to it by the state Power Department as per the Kerala Small Hydro power policy under Built-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) for a lease period of 30 years. CIAL has constructed a weir dam across Iruvazhinji River and hydro-mechanical and electro-mechanical systems at Arippara, near Kodencheri in Kozhikode district. The project was completed in September and trial run started in October.  When the country is deliberating on power crisis, it is the leadership and guidance of the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, as the Chairman of CIAL which turned out to be decisive to speed up the project implementation. We are sure that, this will impart further momentum to set up such hydro projects across the state which has 44 rivers and numerous streams,  S Suhas, the Managing Director of CIAL said in a release. CIAL purchased five acres of land from 32 residents and the total project cost is Rs 52 crore. The powerhouse will generate around 1.08 lakhs unit of power a day during peak flow days and is estimated that the plant could be operational in full capacity for 130 days in a year. Annual power generation is estimated at 14 million units, CIAL said. Suhas said the potential of renewable energy is immense and if wit the help of technological imagination, the government can set up joint ventures to harness the light of the Sun, the power of the wind and the strength of rushing streams and be more productive and efficient in the ways of energy consumption. Being a run of the river project, CIAL SHP works on limited storage of water causing no adverse effect on the environment, it said. The scheme envisages the construction of an overflow type weir across the river, which diverts the water to an intake pool from where the intake structure and connected water conductor system (WCS) start.  A surge tank was constructed to moderate the water flow during load acceptance and load rejection time. A penstock feeds two machines each of 2.25 MW capacity. A powerhouse, with horizontal turbines, is installed at the right bank of the river with an installed capacity of 4.5MW,  it said. The site lies in Nellipoyil Village near Kodencheri in Kozhikode district at a distance of 45 km from Kozhikode City.",

        "articleBody": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd has made a wave of partnerships to give shape to its green energy business that spans solar, battery and hydrogen investments and could contribute almost 10 per cent of the company's pre-tax profits in five years, a report said. The oil-to-retail conglomerate announced a wave of partnerships with REC, NexWafe, Sterling and Wilson, Stiesal and Ambri for total costs of USD 1.2 billion.   With these investments, Reliance has acquired the expertise and technology portfolio to start to build a fully integrated end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem through solar, batteries and hydrogen,  brokerage Bernstein said in a report.  Reliance will commercialise the acquired technologies and set up manufacturing plants in India.   Reliance is expected to continue to invest in technology such as fuel cells and key materials for the clean energy sector.   Based on our assumptions, we believe the new energy business could contribute almost 10 per cent of the company's total EBITDA by FY'26 assuming all the factories are constructed and ramped up on the company's timeline,  it said.  This will make Reliance a highly diversified conglomerate spanning E&P, refining, petrochemicals, clean energy, telecoms, retail and internet, although we suspect that the company will be split up given the inefficiency of such a corporate structure.   Reliance still needs the technology for fuel cell development, which the company is expected to acquire or license from one of the industry leaders such as Plug Power, Ballard, or Ceres.  It may also need to invest in key suppliers for the sector such as manufacturers of cathode, separator and electrolyte for battery manufacturing and could also invest in MEA, catalysts and bipolar plates for fuel cell manufacturing.  Reliance is targeting solar manufacturing of 100 GW and green hydrogen costs of USD 1 per kg by 2030. It will spend USD 10 billion on the new energy business over the next 3 years towards achieving these targets.   Based on capex for clean energy, we see a route to Reliance building a clean energy business, which could be worth USD 36 billion,  Bernstein said.  Reliance is building a green energy business to supply the equipment India will need for its green energy revolution.  Also, the firm has committed to being net carbon zero by 2035, which is earlier than any other energy company in the region.   While Reliance has the balance sheet and relationships, it lacks the technology and manufacturing know-how which will be essential for success. While it is easy to dismiss their ability to pull it off, Reliance has shown they can move into new verticals successfully. We think the same is true here,  the report said.  Reliance at its shareholders' meeting in June announced its plan to invest USD 10 billion in low carbon energy which marks another chapter in the transformation of the company.  Over the next 3 years, Reliance will spend Rs 60,000 crore to construct four 'giga factories' to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries to store energy from the grid. The site of these plants will be located at the new 5,000 acres Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar. An additional Rs 15,000 crore will be used for investments across the value chain, technology, and partnerships for the new energy business.   From oil and gas to telecom, to retail and internet, it's hard to think of another company which has reinvented itself as much as Reliance has done over the past decade. This is a bold move, however, and many will question what Reliance's source of value is in these industries, other than their position as one of the most successful Indian conglomerates,  it said.  Reliance is acquiring REC Solar Holdings from China National Bluestar for USD 771 million.  REC is a well-established manufacturer of polysilicon, PV cells and modules with plants in Norway and Singapore. Using the technology of REC, Reliance will build a new integrated solar manufacturing plant in Jamnagar and expand capacity globally.  Ambani's firm is investing USD 45 million in NexWafe to jointly develop and commercialise at scale monocrystalline green solar wafers, and is acquiring 40 per cent in leading solar EPC and O&M provider Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited (SWSL).  It has also signed a pact with Norway's Stiesdal for technology development, and manufacturing of Stiesdal's HydroGen Electrolyzers in India. Another USD 50 million has been invested in US-based Ambri to develop and commercialize Ambri's liquid metal batteries for energy storage.  Reliance is also in discussion with Ambri to set up a large scale battery manufacturing facility in India.   Overall, Reliance is building a fully integrated end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem for customers through solar, batteries and hydrogen. No other energy company is investing across the entire new energy value chain but if Reliance can pull this off then the value creation and earnings potential will be substantial,  Bernstein said.",

AMNS India is a 60:40 joint venture between Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel of Japan. In 2019, the two foreign entities completed the acquisition of Essar Steel Limited plant located at Hazira in Gujarat, and later renamed it as ArcelorMIttal Nippon Steel (AMNS) India.  AMNS India is exploring opportunities in the Indian renewable energy market, Oommen said.  Without sharing any further details, he said the business plan is being worked on at present.          In August, Lakshmi Mittal, the executive chairman of the parent firm ArcelorMittal along with Oommen had met the then Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani.          During the meeting, Mittal had committed an investment of Rs 1 lakh crore in the state, of which Rs 50,000 crore was to be utilised to expand capacity of Hazira plant and the remaining Rs 50,000 crore in the field of hydrogen gas and renewable energy.  AMNS India is an integrated flat carbon steel manufacturer with an achievable crude steel capacity of 9 million tonnes per annum (MTPA).",

        "articleBody": "Private and co-operative sugar factories as well as standalone distillery units in Maharashtra have produced and supplied 65.06 crore litres of ethanol so far this year, as against the target of 59.61 crore litres set till October, the National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories (NFCSF) said on Thursday.Talking with PTI, NFCSF President Jayprakash Dandegavkar said the purchase prices of ethanol should also go up with the fuel prices in the country by keeping the base price intact. In Maharashtra, the private and co-operative sugar factories and standalone distillery units were given the target of making and supplying 59.61 crore litres of ethanol till October 2021. The state has overachieved the target and has supplied 65.06 crore litres of ethanol till date. The target of ethanol production for the state can go up by 30 per cent,  he said.Sugarcane is being used to make ethanol in the country and it will prove helpful to some extent to those factories that are currently in financial crunch, he added. Ethanol-making will help those factories that are facing losses. We have surplus stock of sugar being produced every year leading to the decline in sugar prices. Many times, sugar is sold below the minimum support price (MSP) by factories due to the excess stock. If a good amount of diversion of factories towards ethanol takes place, it will stabilise the factory and also give ethanol production,  he said.Dandegavkar expressed concern over the entry of private players in the Indian market that might purchase ethanol. There is security for ethanol prices as of today. But, if private players enter the Indian market in the future, they may not be bound to purchase ethanol from sugar factories. The government should make it mandatory to these private players to purchase ethanol from the sugar factories in the country instead of abroad,  he said.Another issue with the ethanol production is its fixed purchase price, Dandegavkar said. The prices of ethanol should be linked with the fuel prices in the country. We have a policy that if the purchase price is fixed, it won't change for at least four-five years. But, the prices should be linked to the market situation. As the fuel prices go up, the sugar factories should also get benefit out of it in terms of the price of ethanol,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "Hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources will account for 20% of Europe's power consumption in 2050, and for 10% globally, a report published by Norwegian power company Statkraft on Thursday showed. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water molecules with a current of renewable electricity in electrolysers. The gas is touted as a clean replacement for fossil fuels in industries that are otherwise hard to decarbonise. European power demand will rise to just over 5,000 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2050, with green hydrogen production accounting for around 1,000 TWh, up from current demand of around 30 TWh, Statkraft's sixth annual Low Emissions Scenario report showed. The company is one of Europe's largest renewable energy producers and also operates several gas plants in Germany. It uses its analysis from the Low Emissions Scenario as the foundation for future investments. Global power demand will likely more than double by 2050 to just over 60,000 TWh as electrification is seen as the main tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions with renewable energy meeting about 80% of that demand, it found. At present, green hydrogen production is more expensive than traditional production from fossil fuel sources, but Statkraft said that would change. The company expected investment costs for electrolysers to fall by 60% by 2050, which coupled with storage could ensure a steady supply for industry.  Seasonal storage can be beneficial in markets with significant power price differences between seasons, for example in Europe,  the report said. It is published ahead of the U.N. Climate summit (COP 26) in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12, where representatives from nearly 200 countries will meet for talks to strengthen action to tackle global warming under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees as per the Paris Climate Accord will require more renewables and electrification at a faster pace than at present, Statkraft said. Statkraft is involved in several green hydrogen projects, including projects to supply steel works and fertiliser production.",

        "articleBody": "US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on Wednesday said India's goal of reaching 450 GW of renewable energy (RE) by 2030 is doable as it has already crossed the 100 GW RE mark. It is really terrific to see India leading the ISA (International Solar Alliance). India is a close partner and the United States strongly supports India's goal of reaching 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. We believe that it's absolutely doable and will be done. India has already set an example for emerging economies by reaching 100GW of renewables,  Kerry said while addressing a session of ISA general assembly.He further said, What India has demonstrated with its low-cost solar auctions and build out of the transmission grids and massive solar parts program and other innovative policy tools can be replicated all over the world. Noting that solar energy is at the heart of the urgent climate action, he urged nations to take dramatic action to keep the 1.5-degree Celsius temperature rise and mid-century net zero emissions targets within reach.He added that President Joe Biden recognizes the clean energy opportunity of solar in the US' efforts to achieve the newly proposed NDC (nationally-determined contribution) of 50-52 per cent reduction in US economy wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.Kerry said  the US department of energy recently published a roadmap for how solar energy could economically generate 40 per cent of the country's electricity supply by 2035. With 1000 GW of installed solar energy, solar would play the biggest role in a completely carbon free electric power sector by 2035. Delivering the keynote address at the inaugural ceremony of the ISA general assembly where 106 countries are participating in the discussions, Kerry applauded ISA and the leadership of India, France and member countries of the ISA assembly in their collaboration to advance the global clean energy transition.He added that ISA is critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has an opportunity to accelerate solar's growth with member countries blessed with the world's strongest sunlight.Speaking on India-US ties and calling India,  a red-hot investment destination for solar power,  Secretary Kerry shared that, leading countries deploying solar power from India to the US are seeing the need for energy storage to balance the intermittency of renewable energy.Harnessing the full value of solar energy will require countries to invest in storage, grid infrastructure and in flexibility in both demand and supply. And to connect solar power with parts of the economy that do not currently use electricity, countries must invest in electric vehicles and clean fuels like hydrogen that can be produced using solar power, he said.Responding to the US Special Presidential Envoy's call to accelerate the momentum in solar, Ajay Mathur, Director General, ISA, said  Secretary Kerry's emphasis on the need to do more is clear. Solar will catalyse the world's transition to a lower-carbon economy, being the lowest cost and most economical solution for increasing power generation capacity in countries. ISA targets USD 1 trillion of investment in solar by 2030, which would be significant in bringing the world closer to energy transitions needed, he added. Through initiatives such as the One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG), which are structured to foster interconnected solar energy infrastructure at global scale, grid interconnection will be key for transitioning to clean energy systems. We look forward to working more closely with the US in combating the climate crisis,  he stated.ISA is an international organisation with 98 member countries. It works with governments to improve energy access and security around the world and promote solar power as a sustainable way to transition to a carbon neutral future.Its mission is to unlock USD 1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing the cost of the technology and its financing.",

        "articleBody": "A latest report from the IPCC has warned the world that climate change is now a \u2018Code Red\u2019 emergency that requires immediate and transformative action before the situation becomes irreversible. Though the political economy of fossil fuels means that this will be no easy task, one thing that is clear is that renewable energy and green technologies offer clear solutions to help reduce global emissions. While it is often common to pit new and competing technologies and predict which is likely to become the industry standard, the scale of the climate change problem means that we are likely to need multiple technologies in conjunction with one another. This is true for the transport sector and electric vehicles - most people think that battery-powered electric vehicles (BPEVs) are the only kind of EVs but there is another competing technology: hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). Though the technology is a few years behind the progress of BPEVs, FCEVs offer unique advantages that mean that they may have a place in a diversified response to climate change.Though both technologies propel vehicles using electricity, the actual mechanisms are quite different. With BPEVs the electricity is generated at a distant power plant and distributed through the grid to charge the batteries driving the motors. With an FCEV, hydrogen stored in pressurised tanks is fed into an electrochemical reaction where it combines with oxygen from the air. It is this reaction that produces the electricity to power the electric motor. Hydrogen cars thus have the characteristics of both electric cars (in the source of energy and type of motor) as well as conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles (they both have tanks that require refuelling).The natural question is whether there is any reason to invest in a new technology that will require a dedicated refuelling infrastructure when so much progress has been made on BPEVs. FCEVs actually offer clear advantages over BPEV as fuel cells have a much higher gravimetric energy storage density than lithium-ion batteries. This means that, unlike lithium-ion, increasing the range of FCEVs does not come at the cost of additional weight. Generally speaking, when it comes to higher weights, higher range and higher speeds - FCEVs outperform their battery counterparts. Refuelling FCEVs is also comparable with ICE vehicles and only takes a few minutes, compared to the long charging times of BPEVs. This can be pivotal to those who have neither the time nor the resources or space to charge a parked car for extended periods. Finally, there is the question of the chemistry itself. FCEVs are powered by hydrogen, the third-most abundant element on the surface of the Earth, and their only emissions are water.However, despite its relative abundance, hydrogen is almost never found in its pure state (the form it needs to be in for fuel cells) and is bonded to other elements. Extracting it is an energy-intensive process that makes the overall energy efficiency of FCEVs lower than BPEVs (but still higher than ICE vehicles). Furthermore, the byproducts of the extraction process for the two primary sources of hydrogen (natural gas and coal) are significantly worse than CO2 and the environmental consequences of fossil fuel extraction methods like fracking are, of course, well known. Distributing compressed hydrogen also presents its own difficulties, making the crucial step of installing critical infrastructure a challenge. Ultimately, the biggest limitation right now are the expenses; whether setting up refuelling stations or refuelling, FCEVs can be cost-prohibitive. Pathways to growthThankfully, there are a variety of solutions to many of these challenges. Electrolysis is a promising solution to hydrogen extraction if there is an abundance of renewable energy, while hydrogen fuel stations can be set up alongside regular fuel pumps. As is the case with BPEVs, reaching a critical mass of FCEV users will help power the investments and research to make them more viable. There are a couple of avenues that could make this possible.The first is in cargo transportation. The range and energy density of FCEVs make them ideally suited for carrying high payloads. Moreover, the quick refuelling time, comparable with ICE vehicles, enables logistics companies to maintain efficiencies and avoid long charging times. BPEV manufacturers have innovated fast DC charging solutions but these are meant to only be used sporadically otherwise they damage the battery and reduce its life cycle. Fast-charging repeatedly at the scale that logistics companies would require would add a significant layer of costs for battery replacements. This is a concern because lithium-ion batteries, the prevalent technology, are problematic enough to produce as is. As such, batteries are currently not the ideal solution for vehicles that need to be in continuous use over long distances. There is even significant research going into the use of hydrogen fuel cells in trains and aviation, though the latter will likely require a major overhaul of fuselage design.Another possible scenario that will make the adoption of FCEVs more viable will be the abundance of renewable energy. It is possible to avoid the environmental concerns of extracting hydrogen from fossil fuels by using electrolysis to isolate hydrogen from water. The only catch is that this process requires large amounts of electricity. Given that most electricity is still largely generated through fossil fuels the net effect on the environment would actually be zero or even negative. However, an abundance of renewable energy sources could make FCEVs much more viable environmentally and economically.It\u2019s not a zero-sum gameUltimately, the EVs of the future are likely to be powered by a combination of fuel cells and batteries. They each have their own advantages (and disadvantages) as well as scenarios that they are ideally suited to. Right now, FCEVs are clearly behind BPEVs in their respective growth stories and lack their political economies, adoption rates and public awareness. However, this should be no bar to researching a technology that clearly holds promise. There is no need to choose between competing technologies, especially when the only relevant metric for winning should be net reductions in emissions. Whether it is through hydrogen fuel cells or batteries, the ultimate winners will be the EV industry and the entire planet.[This piece was authored by Shreyas Shibulal, Founder and Director, Micelio]",

        "articleBody": "A defining provision in India\u2019s 2021\u201322 Union Budget was the announcement of the National Hydrogen Mission. With it, India has shown its intent to adopt one of the more important future energy technologies. Globally, hydrogen is creating a buzz, thanks to its potential for use across a variety of sectors, such as fuel for vehicles, as an energy substitute for fossil fuels in hard-to-abate industrial sectors, etc.Beyond production and consumption, there is the third pillar of a future hydrogen economy \u2014 the delivery for end-use applications. Hydrogen is flammable, and its storage and transmission in its elemental form is inefficient and not cost-effective. Despite high energy content, it has an extremely low density, and thus, occupies a lot of volume. These arguments are regularly used against the use of hydrogen in future energy systems. Until these technical barriers are addressed, hydrogen delivery will remain a bottleneck in wide-scale adoption.Currently, hydrogen in India is produced close to its usage location (e.g., in industries such as oil refineries, ammonia production), with little requirement for storage. However, this will change in the future to meet the proposed high demand. NTPC Ltd is working on building infrastructure for hydrogen-powered buses in Ladakh. Corporate players too have unveiled plans to invest in low-carbon technologies, with hydrogen a key part of these plans.Going forward, hydrogen will have a bigger role in the industrial and transportation sectors. This requires cost-effective options for storage and transmission in order to integrate hydrogen into India\u2019s energy mix. Transmission of hydrogen primarily occurs through three routes \u2014 via ships across continents, through pipelines (for longer distances, higher volumes), and by trucks (for local distribution). While pipelines are expected to have lower costs of transmission (due to economies of scale), they require a high initial investment. There are also concerns over the degradation of the pipelines due to the nature of hydrogen.Storage optionsThe medium used for storing hydrogen is key, with a variety of technologies being developed for it. These include compressed hydrogen, liquefied hydrogen, ammonia, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (or LOHCs), geological storage, metal hydrides, etc.Compressed Hydrogen is a well-established technology, mainly in the application as on-board storage in transportation. However, two technologies, in particular, could play an important role in the future of hydrogen delivery in the Indian context. Liquefied hydrogen is significantly more energy-intensive as a process and requires specialised insulated tanks to avoid evaporation losses. However, it can be discharged rapidly. Importantly, the higher storage capacity of hydrogen in its liquid form can ultimately result in lower transmission costs. Ammonia is an interesting choice of storage technology, given its extensive use worldwide as a feedstock itself. Nevertheless, ammonia contains a high amount of hydrogen and can be stored as a liquid in near-ambient form. This translates into much lower delivery costs of hydrogen for larger volumes and longer distances.A graph was made based on literature, breaking down the final costs for delivering hydrogen under various pathways and the cost uncertainties (highlighted in grey) involved:   87131195As these technologies mature and system sizes expand, the costs of delivering hydrogen are expected to drop further. Economics is vital to understand feasible pathways for hydrogen delivery. However, other factors such as resource (land, water, material, equipment) requirements, energy densities, volume capacities, etc., also have to be considered. Naturally occurring geological formations such as salt caverns, aquifers or depleted gas fields have high storage capacities and can hold hydrogen for extended periods of time. Such geological storage systems typically have lower costs for storing hydrogen and would be an ideal option. Yet, there is little data on the availability of sites in India that would be technically feasible. Multiple pathways will likely be used for delivering hydrogen, depending on the application, location, and other factors.However, is it just better to produce hydrogen at the site of an application instead? Energy availability (coal, natural gas, electricity, biomass, solar, or wind resources, etc.) and land and water requirements may be constraints for on-site hydrogen production. Both pathways of hydrogen production or hydrogen storage and transmission have different equipment and material (electrolysers, storage tanks, catalysts, etc.) requirements. The decision to produce hydrogen must also factor in the availability of local technology service providers for such components.Hydrogen demand will increase rapidly as several sectors (in addition to the conventional ones) realise its applications. This is similar to the nascent stages of the solar revolution a decade ago. It is important to start building capacity of storage technologies like compressed or liquefied hydrogen now. There is much progress desired in the deployment of hydrogen delivery systems. But similar \u2018difficult\u2019 elements such as ammonia and natural gas are now extensively used worldwide on theback of a well-developed supply chain. With adequate research and investment towards the delivery systems, hydrogen too can emerge as a key component of the energy future.[This piece was authored by Dhruv Rajeev.

        "articleBody": "In the far north of the United Kingdom, where the wind blows and the sea rages, the islands of Orkney and Shetland have long relied on oil and gas for prosperity. But as supplies dwindle and the fight against climate change becomes more urgent, the islands off the northeast coast of Scotland are increasingly turning to renewables. Daniel Wise is head of offshore operations at Orbital Marine Power, a start-up that is testing its 02 tidal energy generator off Orkney.  The submerged propellers turn with the current, producing enough electricity to power some 2,000 homes.  Half a billion tonnes of seawater moves per hour on this site, so it's very good for testing these turbines,  Wise told AFP. On Orkney and Shetland, which are nearer to Norway than London, giant standing stones are a visual reminder of the ancient Neolithic past. Now, gleaming white wind turbines are seen as symbols of a brighter, more sustainable future.  A lot of people describe Orkney as a living laboratory,  said Jerry Gibson, operations technician at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), which tests wave and tidal energy converters on Orkney.  And we have lots of test sites and various different companies that are all working together... in this sort of green economy that we've got going on.  EMEC itself produces  green  hydrogen from renewable sources via a tidal turbine and electrolysis using seawater from Eday, one of Orkney's 20 inhabited islands. The hydrogen is pressurised and transported 16 miles (26 kilometres) south to the port of Kirkwall, where it is transformed into electricity to power the ferries at the quayside.Reliability  Given its plentiful natural resources from wind and waves, Orkney -- home to some 22,000 people -- produces more energy than it uses.  Hydrogen is important because it's another means of storing energy rather than using batteries or going straight to the electricity grid,  said Gibson. EMEC is also testing wave energy generators in the laboratory, which is more complex to model than tidal energy. On the island of Yell, some 100 miles northeast on the former Viking stronghold of Shetland, another company, Nova Innovation, is also betting on the ebb and flow of tides.  The beauty of tidal energy is that it's totally predictable,  said Tom Wills, offshore manager at the company.   So I can tell you tomorrow or 2,000 years from now, how much tide is going to be flowing through that channel out there, our energy resources are not dependent on the weather.  That predictability is crucial for the stability of energy supply as economies try to move away from high-polluting hydrocarbons. Nova has set up a charging point in the village of Cullivoe on Yell for electric vehicles, powered by its underwater turbines. Fiona Nicholson, who lives nearby, is a regular user.  Where we live, we look out on the sea and we hear it every day and we know the power of it,  she said.  So, it's nice to be able to use it to charge the car for all my long commutes.  The Sullom Voe oil terminal on the main island of Shetland is one of the largest in Europe. Locals acknowledge that North Sea drilling and infrastructure have brought benefits. Revenue from the operations have funded roads, schools and sports centres, as well as supported thousands of jobs for the Shetlands' nearly 23,000 inhabitants. But equally, residents know time is running out and renewables offer a potential solution, even if some projects are contested.Worse than oil? One such project is the giant Viking Wind Farm, a partnership between SSE Renewables and the Shetland authorities. It is scheduled to come on stream in 2023 and will have 103 turbines generating enough low-carbon energy to power nearly 476,000 homes. The project could save half a million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year, the company says, and make Shetland a net exporter of electricity.  But many locals are critical and have fought a long legal battle against it since planning permission was first approved in 2012.  If they had come originally with a reasonably sized wind farm, I don't think anybody would have objected,  said Donnie Morrison, whose hillside home will soon be surrounded by roaring turbines.  But it's so huge, it's ridiculous.  Laurie Goodlad, a tour guide, said the project would see the removal of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of peatland -- a recognised carbon sink.  They're basically digging up the lungs of the planet,  she said. Despite assurances that excavated peat will be reused, and no construction on pristine peat bogs, opponents even say Viking will be more environmentally destructive than the controversial drilling of new oil fields such as Cambo, northwest of Shetland.  I see Cambo as less of a threat than what Viking Energy is,  said Goodlad.   Cambo and Viking Energy, ultimately, are doing the same thing: they're removing fossil fuels from the ground.  Residents also fear they will not benefit from electricity exports, despite assurances the community will receive dividends, as it does from oil.Transferable skills At the Shetland Islands Council, energy project manager Joe Najduch acknowledged that the Viking project had divided public opinion.  Obviously, developing an onshore wind farm can be quite disruptive to the island but the benefits seems to outweigh the costs,  he said. Another issue, trade unions say, is a lack of employment prospects, with the thousands of well-paid oil jobs unlikely to be all replaced by renewables. Viking Energy says about 140 people will be needed to work on the project and some 35 permanent jobs will be created, but unions say that is not enough. EMEC's Gibson is more optimistic, seeing oil and gas industry skills as transferable. At the same time, not switching to renewables would cause its own problems, said Najduch.  Oil and gas could last in Shetland until roughly 2050,  he said.  If we don't develop it (renewables), we'll rely more on imports. ",

The company also has explored the option of setting up a renewable energy infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) with its operational power assets.Tata Power and CPPIB declined to comment. GIC didn't respond to queries sent Wednesday.The unit is one of India's largest renewable energy businesses with an operating capacity of 2.6 GW comprising wind and solar in a 32:68 ratio spread across 11 states.The shift to clean energy, in keeping with the current environmental sustainability focus, is getting a lot of investor interest, said experts.  There is a visible change in the company's big focus from traditional areas to bet on green energy,  said an executive close to the company.  And this plan will fetch its businesses better valuations. Tata Power has said it plans to phase out coal-based capacity and expand its clean and green capacity to 80% by FY30. Renewable energy currently comprises over a third of its total capacity of 13 GW.ET reported recently that the company had kicked off the fund-raising process by clubbing its entire renewables portfolio under an umbrella entity. This includes operating and pipeline independent power producer (IPP) assets, charging stations, rooftop solar, microgrids, panel manufacturing, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC). It aims to raise equity for the entire platform, restarting fundraising efforts for the renewables business six months after pulling out of negotiations with Malaysia's Petronas for investments of up to $2 billion.ICRA upgraded the Tata Power Renewables credit rating in June to stable. This reflects its strengths arising from the well-diversified renewable power portfolio across 11 states, it had said. The portfolio reduces vulnerability of generation to location-specific issues, and a diversified customer mix, which partly mitigates the counterparty credit related risks,  ICRA said.  Further, the rating draws comfort from the demonstrated operating track record-82% of the portfolio has a track record of more than three years and 16% of the portfolio has an operational track record of one to three years. The renewable energy space has seen substantial fund inflows from financial investors in recent years. ",

In a statement, Welspun Corp said it is the first company from India to join the H2Pipe Joint Industry Project on Hydrogen Pipelines launched by leading industrial certification body DNV AS Energy Systems Pipeline Technology. As a Steering Committee Member, Welspun Corp will collaborate with the world's 24 premier energy companies including Shell, BP, Total Energies, Equinor, Wood, Orsted, Gassco, Wintershall Dea, Intecsea, Subsea7, TechnipFMC and Saipem, to provide technical expertise in the project aimed at laying the foundation of hydrogen infrastructure, the company said in a statement.      Welspun Corp becomes the first company from India to join the H2Pipe Joint Industry Project on Hydrogen Pipelines. The company will collaborate with global oil and gas majors to develop the world's first guideline for the transport of hydrogen gas in existing and new offshore pipelines,  it said.     As part of the project, Welspun Corp said it will help develop a recommended practice (RP) for design, re-qualification, construction and operation of pipelines for hydrogen gas transportation in offshore pipelines and complement existing standards such as DNVGL ST F101 (submarine pipeline systems). This industry-first project will provide guidance to the global energy sector as it shifts towards clean energy using alternative sources, with hydrogen emerging as an important pillar for energy transition.     According to the company statement, the H2Pipe project will be executed in multiple phases. The first phase will focus on the assessment of existing standards, including the offshore standard DNVGL-ST-F101, to identify the scope and additional considerations for hydrogen transportation. This will be captured in an industry guideline and will include preliminary experimental activities.     The subsequent phases will be experimental to define the requirements and acceptance criteria for offshore hydrogen pipelines, it said.     Balkrishan Goenka, Chairman, Welspun Group said,  We are prepared and thrilled to drive this important research that supports the world's energy transition. Our participation in this international initiative will allow us to be at the forefront of creating a smarter and a more sustainable world, while charting the course for the development of a futuristic hydrogen pipeline across markets, including India.   Vipul Mathur, Managing Director and CEO, Welspun Corp said as energy demands across the world evolve rapidly, his company is confident of undertaking strategic interventions in new opportunities and new segments.   Through this project, not only are we leveraging our technical expertise and enhancing our global focus, we are also playing an active role in creating both economic value and sustainable gains for the industry,  he said.     Welspun Corp Ltd (WCL) is one of world's leading welded line pipe manufacturers, and the flagship company of the Welspun Group which has significant presence in other sectors like home textiles, infrastructure, advanced textiles, and flooring solutions etc. ",

        "articleBody": "Renewable energy firm ACME Group on Monday announced its partnership with the US-based KBR Technology for its USD 3.5-billion green hydrogen and green ammonia project in Oman. Under the contract, KBR will provide technology licence, engineering, proprietary equipment, catalyst and commissioning services for a plant to produce ammonia, the company said in a statement.   This facility, aimed towards exporting green ammonia to Europe and Asia, will be the first project of this scale.   We selected KBR Technology because of its high yields and the lowest energy consumption and look forward to successful project implementation,  Manoj K Upadhyay, founder and chairman of ACME Group, said in the statement.  In March 2021, ACME Group and the Oman Company for the Development of the Special Economic Zone at Duqm had signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a large-scale facility to produce green hydrogen and green ammonia. The plant will be an integrated facility using three gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar and 0.5 GWp of wind energy to produce 2,400 TPD of green ammonia with an annual production of about 0.9 million tonnes.  Recently, the ACME Group signed a land pact to set up one of the world's largest green ammonia projects at the special economic zone at the port of Duqm in Oman. The agreement was signed with the Public Authority for Special Economic Zones and Free Zones, a government authority of Oman. Black & Veatch has been appointed as the environmental consultant and owner's engineer for the project.  ACME Group is in the process of commissioning the world's first integrated green hydrogen and green ammonia plant in Bikaner, India. Green hydrogen will be produced using five megawatt-peak (MWp), expandable up to 10 MWp, from the solar plant, which is an integral part of the project.  ACME Group has built a solar portfolio of six GWp. Of this, the company currently holds a portfolio of 5.25 GWp, which includes 2.2 GWp of operational capacity and another 3.05 GWp is under construction. These are spread across 12 states in India.",

        "articleBody": "The National Green Tribunal has directed the Ministry of Environment and Forests to file an expert opinion on the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti Hydro-Electric project in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on a plea against grant of environmental clearance to the project. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel issued notice to the MoEF and the project proponent, THDC India Ltd, and asked them to file their response within a month.  We also direct the MoEF to obtain and file an expert opinion from the Expert Appraisal Committee for river valley and hydro-electric project within two months by e-mail,  the bench said in its October 8 order. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Dr. Bharat Jhunjhunwala and others against environment clearance dated August 26 granted by MoEF to the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti Hydro-Electric Project of 444 MW in an area of 141.568 ha by M/s THDC India Limited located at Haat village in Chamoli. The appellant has stated that initially the EC for the project was granted on August 22, 2007 for ten years, which was extended for three years and has been now extended up to August 21, 2021.  However, the project has not been operationalised and is still under construction. The project is funded by the World Bank. Out of total cost of about Rs. 3800 crore more than 50 per cent of the cost has already been incurred,  the plea said. According to the plea, Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is in favour of abandoning the project. Dispensing with of public hearing is not called for nor valid as the project is not completed to the extent of 50 per cent, as required for such an exemption, it said The EAC has not undertaken proper evaluation of the mitigation measures, it submitted.  It has gone by rapid Environment Impact Assessment ignoring deficiencies, particularly impacts of soil erosion, blasting, decline in water quality, loss of aesthetic values and loss of aquatic biodiversity. These impacts have not been duly evaluated nor included in the CBA,  the plea submitted. The Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydro Electric Project (VPHEP) is a proposed 444 Megawatt (MW) run-of-the-river hydro generation project on the Alaknanda River, which is a tributary of the Ganga.",

        "articleBody": "Ethanol blending with petrol has been achieved in all the states and UTs, and is likely to touch around 8.3 per cent in the 2020-21 marketing year ending November, according to a senior official of state-owned HPCL. Ethanol blending with petrol stood at 5 per cent in 2019-20. Addressing a webinar organised by Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), HPCL ED C Sridhar Goud highlighted that blending is expected to jump to around 8.2-8.3 per cent in current ethanol supply year (December to November), from an average ethanol blending of 5 per cent in the last two years. He highlighted that the Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP) has reached the entire country.  Sikkim was the last state. Four days ago, we reached Sikkim as well. Ethanol blending is taking place in all states,  Goud said.  Achieved Ethanol blending in all the States & UTs in current ESY 20-21,  he said in the presentation. Goud expressed confidence that the blending level of 10 per cent would be achieved in the 2021-22 ethanol supply or marketing year. Sugar mills supply ethanol to oil marketing companies (OMCs) for blending with petrol. HPCL has a strong presence in refining and marketing of petroleum products in the country. ISMA's Director General Abinash Verma said that the industry, including sugar sector, would have enough capacities to produce and supply 10 billion litres of ethanol. He said 10.5 billion litres of ethanol will be required to achieve 20 per cent blending with petrol by 2025. Out of the total requirement, 6-6.5 billion litres are expected to come from sugarcane and molasses while 4-4.5 billion litres from grain and corn. Verma said the current installed capacity is 6 billion litre, of which 5.25 billion litres are sugarcane molasses based capacity. To achieve 20 per cent blending, he said the requirement of installed capacity is estimated at 12 billion litre, of which 6.5-7 billion litre would be through feedstock of sugarcane and molasses.  ...huge interest being shown by investors to set up ethanol production capacities. Around 800 projects have registered with the government. Some sugar companies also setting up dual feed ethanol plants, where corn and grains can be used in addition to sugarcane and molasses,  Verma said in his presentation. Earlier this month, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey had said the government was encouraging ethanol production not only from molasses but also from foodgrains like maize and rice to achieve the blending targets. Around 17 million tonnes of surplus foodgrains would be utilised for manufacturing of ethanol, he had said.",

Last month, Adani had said that the group will invest over $20 billion on clean energy, supporting equipment manufacturing units and infrastructure over the next 10 years. He had earlier expressed his ambitions of making the Adani Group the world's largest renewable power company by 2030. Over the next decade, we will invest over $20 billion in renewable energy generation. Our overall organic and inorganic investments across the entire green energy value chain will range between $50 billion and $70 billion. This will include investments with potential partners for electrolyzer manufacturing, backward integrations to secure the supply chain for our solar and wind generation businesses, and AI-based industrial cloud platforms,  Adani said at TiE Summit on Monday. The global focus on net zero carbon emission and Indian government's push towards clean and green energy has led to investment commitments from Indian heavyweights. In June, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said that Reliance Industries, a recent entrant in the clean energy space, will investment of Rs 75,000 crore ($10 billion) over the next three years to build a new clean energy business to fuel its commitment to be net carbon neutral by 2035.

We have experienced false starts before with hydrogen, so we can't take success for granted,  said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. But this time, we are seeing exciting progress in making hydrogen cleaner, more affordable and more available for use across different sectors of the economy,  he said.Birol urged governments to  take rapid actions to lower the barriers that are holding low-carbon hydrogen back from faster growth, which will be important if the world is to have a chance of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Nearly all hydrogen produced today comes from fossil fuels and releases 900 million tonnes of CO2 emissions -- as much as Britain and Indonesia combined, according to the IEA.Low-carbon hydrogen requires large amounts of electricity to produce it from water, or the use of carbon-capture technologies if it is to be made from fossil fuels, it said. The main obstacle to the extensive use of low-carbon hydrogen is the cost of producing it,  the report said.The report comes as governments prepare for the COP26 climate summit in Scotland next month.",

        "articleBody": "The government on Friday said around 17 million tonnes of surplus foodgrains will be utilised, apart from sugarcane molasses, for manufacturing ethanol to achieve the target of 20 per cent blending with petrol by 2025. Addressing a webinar organised by sugar industry body ISMA, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said the government is encouraging ethanol production not only from molasses but also from foodgrains like maize and rice to achieve the blending targets. He said the country has been producing surplus sugar production of about 4-4.5 million tonnes for the last few years, with the production of over 30 million tonnes and domestic demand of around 26 million tonnes. The secretary pointed out that the surplus output led to a fall in domestic prices of the sweetener, which in turn affected both farmers and sugar mills. To deal with the surplus sugar output and depressed ex-factory prices of the sweetener, Pandey highlighted that the government made two policy interventions in form of transport assistance to mills for exporting sugar and promotion of ethanol.  We made out a very committed policy for diverting this excess production or towards ethanol production and industry came forward in a big way,  he said. In the 2020-21 marketing year that ended last month, Pandey said the sugar mills were able to divert roughly about 2 million tonnes of sugar towards ethanol production. Sugar marketing year runs from October to September.  ...this year we hope to divert roughly about 3.5 million tonnes towards ethanol production, and next year 6 million tonnes of sugar will be reduced as we will divert this towards ethanol production,  the secretary said. On the automobile industry side, he said the government has come out with regulations for the fuel.  The E-10 is now already allowed, and E-20 by 2024, the implementation will start. Mandatorily by 2025, the 20 per cent blending across India will be achieved.  In the 2020-21 ethanol marketing year ending November, the country is estimated to achieve an 8.5 per cent blending of ethanol with petrol, with a supply of 3.35 billion litres to oil marketing companies (OMCs), according to ISMA. After this interim intervention, he said the government is now going a step ahead and allowing the use of foodgrains to make ethanol.  But now we are going a step ahead. We are also going to use roughly about 165 (lakh tonnes), almost 17 million tonnes of food grains, which is also surplus...,  Pandey said. The secretary said the government currently has about 90 million tonnes of foodgrain stocks in the central pool.  Many countries thought that this is a stock which is burdening the market and is depressing the market sentiments, but during COVID-19,...almost 60 million tonnes of foodgrains have been distributed to about 800 million population free of cost,  he noted. The free of cost distribution of foodgrains helped the country in fighting the COVID pandemic in a very effective way and ensuring food security of people affected by the pandemic, the secretary said.  So now, India would be when moving towards E20 target, will also be using about 17 million tonnes of food grains for ethanol production. And we also intend to move towards the flexi-fuel in the country, so that even higher level of blending is permitted,  Pandey said. The secretary said that the automobile industry has been invited to bring in the technology, already available globally so that the surplus foodgrains and sugarcane get utilised. In June this year, the Centre had allocated 78,000 tonnes of rice from the state-run Food Corporation of India (FCI) at a subsidised rate of Rs 20/kg to distilleries for the current ethanol marketing year ending November. The government has approved various proposals for setting up grain-based new/expansion of distilleries. The government has already notified that it would make E20 fuel available by April 2023. E20 contains 20 per cent ethanol and 80 per cent gasoline.",

        "articleBody": "A team of scientists has, for the first time, developed a reactor that produces a substantial amount of hydrogen using sustainable sources like sunlight and water, which is a cost-effective and sustainable process, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) said on Wednesday. Development of large-scale prototype reactors with photocatalysts (suspended powders) and a successful use of those in large-scale hydrogen production is under process, it said in a statement. The development assumes significance as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his Independence Day speech, had announced the launch of a National Hydrogen Mission to accelerate plans to generate the carbon-free fuel from renewables as he set a target of 2047 for the country to achieve self-reliance in energy. India has set a target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. To achieve this, researchers are working towards renewable energy solutions that should be sustainable with a limited carbon footprint. One of the most economical ways to achieve this is to produce hydrogen at a large scale through photocatalytic water splitting. It is the long-term persistent solution for the growing renewable energy needs and a low-cost economic process that will benefit the society in the longer term. Thus, significant efforts from scientists towards achieving this goal are utmost necessary and an urgent need of the hour. In this direction, Dr Kamalakannan Kailasam and his team, including Professor Ashok K Ganguli, Dr Vivek Bagchi, Dr Sanyasinaidu Boddu, Dr Prakash P N and Dr Menaka Jha from the Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST), Mohali have developed a prototype reactor that operates under natural sunlight to produce hydrogen at a larger scale (around 6.1 litre in eight hours). They have used an earth-abundant chemical called carbon nitrides as a catalyst for the purpose. The process was attempted many times by several researchers using complex metal oxide or nitride or sulphide-based heterogeneous systems, but it was very difficult to reproduce hydrogen in large quantities. The INST team employed the low-cost organic semiconductor in carbon nitrides, which can be prepared using cheaper precursors like urea and melamine at ease in a kilogram scale. When the sunlight falls on this semiconductor, electrons and holes are generated. The electrons reduce the protons to produce hydrogen and the holes are consumed by some chemical agents called sacrificial agents. If the holes are not consumed, they will recombine with the electrons. This work is supported by the DST Nano Mission NATDP project and the related article has been published in the  Journal of Cleaner Production  recently. The team is in the process of obtaining a patent for the technology. The INST team has been working in this area of photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen for quite some time now.  The energy crisis and ever-threatening climate crisis urged us to work on this promising way of hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting. The stability and chemical flexibility of having different organic groups in carbon nitrides triggered us to work on these cost-effective organic semiconductor materials for sustainable hydrogen production,  Dr Kamalakannan said. The INST team started from the lab-scale process to the bulk scale of developing the photocatalyst and hydrogen production through a large prototype reactor. The team is in the process of optimising the hydrogen production with effective sunlight hours, in addition to the purity of the hydrogen, moisture traps and gas separation membranes so as to hyphenate with the fuel cells. Hydrogen generated in this manner can be used in many forms like electricity generation through fuel cells in remote tribal areas, hydrogen stoves and powering small gadgets, to mention a few. Eventually, they can power transformers and e-vehicles, which are long-term research goals that are under progress, according to the statement.",

        "articleBody": "Sugar and engineering major Triveni Engineering & Industries plans to invest Rs 350 crore to double its alcohol manufacturing capacity over the next nine months, as the company seeks to gain from the government\u2019s push for ethanol blending in petrol.With the investment, the company will set up two new distilleries and increase the capacity at its existing two distilleries, eventually raising its alcohol manufacturing capacity from 320 kilolitres per day (klpd) to 660 klpd.The target of 660 klpd is expected to be achieved by the first quarter of the next financial year, according to Tarun Sawhney, managing director of Triveni Engineering & Industries.The company estimates that revenue from its distillery business will increase to about Rs 1,500 crore annually once this capacity is achieved. In FY21, the revenue from the distillery business was Rs 544 crore, with a profit of Rs 101 crore, as per the company\u2019s annual report.\u201cThe actual return on capital employed for this new capex is going to be very, very high because the enhanced revenue for such a small amount of capital is quite large,\u201d Sawhney told ET.The government\u2019s ethanol blending programme involves mixing ethanol with petrol to reduce pollution and the import of crude oil. This will also create an additional revenue stream for farmers and the sugar industry, as cane syrup is primarily used to produce ethanol.In June this year, the Centre had advanced the target of achieving E20, or blending 20% ethanol in petrol, by five years to 2025. At present, the national average for ethanol blending is 8-9%.Over 90% of Triveni\u2019s revenue comes from its sugar and alcohol business. It has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% over the past four years.Sawhney attributes this to increased production of sugar--from 600,000 tonnes to almost a million tonnes a year over this period. This was done by increasing the capacity across its seven sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh and by helping farmers who supply to its mills to increase their yield.\u201cOver the last five years, I can certainly say this about our farmers--their take home income has grown by 3x. And it is because of the increase in yield, because sugarcane is paid for by weight,\u201d Sawhney said.However, Sawhney said that over the coming years, the growth in revenue will be aided more by its engineering businesses, which include manufacturing power transmission systems and water purification plants.\u201cThe engineering businesses are going to be growing at a faster pace compared to sugar. And the reason is simple. Our increases in production are going to be limited,\u201d he said.Sanjay Manyal of ICICI Securities wrote in August that Triveni was one of the most efficient sugar companies in India, having the third-largest sugarcane crushing capacity.\u201cTEL would be a beneficiary of higher global sugar prices, given it is holding large sugar inventories and is capable of exporting white sugar (fetches better realisations). With the negligible impact of lower sugarcane yields, recovery rates, higher export potentials (and) sustainable distillery operations, we believe the company would witness stronger operating profit growth,\u201d Manyal wrote.On Tuesday, shares of Triveni Engineering & Industries closed 1.77% higher on the BSE at Rs 174.9.",

        "articleBody": "Emphasising that energy transition has to be just, inclusive and equitable, India has stressed that there cannot be a  one-size-fits-all solution  as it underlined the importance of the need to be fully sensitive to the energy-mix and national circumstances of different countries.  In a video statement to the UN High Level Dialogue on Energy 2021 held on Friday on the sidelines of the 76th General Assembly session, Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy R K Singh said India has set an ambitious target of 450 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and is all set to launch a National Hydrogen Energy Mission to scale up in a major way the use of green hydrogen toward decarbonisation of the economy.  Green hydrogen is created using renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. It has the potential to provide clean power for manufacturing, transportation, and the only byproduct is water.   Today, as we discuss energy transition, energy access and finance, I would like to reiterate the importance of being fully sensitive to the energy-mix and national circumstances of different countries. There cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution,  Singh said.  The National Hydrogen Energy Mission would scale up annual green hydrogen production to 1 metric ton (MT) by 2030. The mission would make India a global hub for green hydrogen production and export, the minister said, adding that the country is also continuing to work on improving energy efficiency across various sectors and several renewable energy based citizen centric measures like solarisation of agriculture and the rooftop solar programme.  India's Energy Compacts submitted to the dialogue on energy reflect  our endeavours and commitment toward energy transition. Our partners in the public and private sectors have further committed to transformative goals through their own energy compacts .  According to a statement released by the UN, India also committed to begin a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme to add 10 GW solar PV manufacturing capacity by 2025, create 15 million metric tonnes (MMT) production capacity of compressed biogas (CBG) by 2024, achieve 20% ethanol blending in petrol by Ethanol Supply Year 2025-26.  India has also promised to enhance energy efficiency in agriculture, buildings, industry and transport sectors and promote energy-efficient appliances/equipment to reduce India's emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35% over 2005 levels by 2030.  Singh told the meeting that India has set for itself ambitious targets for the energy transition and has taken many bold steps towards achieving them.   We achieved universal access to electricity by electrifying more than 18,000 villages in under 1,000 days and more than 28 million households in just 18 months in what was the largest expansion of access in such a short time anywhere in the world,  he said.  Singh said India's installed non-fossil fuel based electricity generation capacity today stands at more than 153 GW, which comes to more than 39% of the country's total installed power generation capacity. India has a further 63 GW under installation and 29 GW under bid and this comes to 245 GW overall.  New multi-billion-dollar commitments to increase renewables and access to electricity and clean cooking technologies were announced at the critical UN energy summit aimed at boosting efforts to reduce the ranks of nearly 800 million people living in energy poverty without electricity access while setting the world on a trajectory towards net-zero-emissions by 2050.  More than USD 400 billion in new finance and investment was committed by governments and the private sector during the UN High-level Dialogue on Energy, the first leader-level meeting on energy under the auspices of the UN General Assembly in 40 years, a statement by the UN said.  Over 35 countries -- ranging from Small Island Developing States to major emerging and industrialised economies -- made significant new energy commitments in the form of Energy Compacts.  Additionally, several new partnership initiatives were announced, aiming to provide and improve access to reliable electricity to over a billion people.  The new commitments would result in large increases in the installed capacity of renewable energy and significant improvements in energy efficiency around the world -- leading to hundreds of new renewable energy facilities and the creation of millions of new green jobs.  Singh said while the global pandemic tragically affected lives across the world, it also brought out the collective resilience, resolve and can-do spirit. India has administered more than 772 million doses to its citizens, making its vaccination programme one of the world's largest and fastest.   We have also distributed more than 66 million vaccines to other countries  as of May this year.  Underscoring that  we all agree that the energy transition has to be just, inclusive and equitable, leaving no one behind,  Singh said the entire international community needs to come together and work on the time tested principle of  common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities  -- with the developed countries supporting the transition in developing nations through technology transfer and affordable financing.  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) with 98 signatories, co-founded by India and France, is a multilateral initiative targeted in this direction, he said.  The energy summit took place as world leaders grappled with the critical urgency to keep the 1.5 degrees temperature target of the Paris Agreement within reach, and cut emissions by 45% by 2030, while closing the energy access gap and providing more than one billion people who currently rely on harmful fuels with clean cooking solutions.  The new commitments showcase the bold actions needed to meet the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7).  Recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have shown that countries are not moving fast enough on climate action to avert disastrous consequences, and that even if countries met all their NDC commitments under the Paris Agreement, the collective impact would be only a fraction of what is needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.",

Putting forward his requests at a one-day investors\u2019 meet on exploration and production and investment opportunities in North Eastern Region, Sarma said that if the refineries of the state are allowed to do the ethanol blending in their own plants, the proposition becomes cost effective and the state will be able to meet its own demands of green fuel from its own yard. Referring to the State government\u2019s Ethanol Production Promotion Policy and the ethanol\u2019s utilization in oil marketing companies, Sarma said that in the event, oil refineries are allowed for ethanol blending, there will be capacity empowerment of the companies besides enabling them to meet the demands of green energy.Sarma also requested Union Minister Puri for his ministry\u2019s support in the capacity enhancement of Digboi Oil Refinery which has the distinction of being the first refinery in Asia and one of the oldest refineries in operation. He also requested the Union Minister for expanding the base of gas cracker project in Assam as well as his ministry\u2019s support for exploration of the energy sources in the state. Sarma said that his government will extend all possible help to the ministry in its bid to efficient management of all its projects in Assam and starting new ones in the state.Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri while speaking at the investors\u2019 meet said that North Eastern region of the country is one of the most promising regions of the country in terms of economic potential. He also said that in sync with the government\u2019s commitment to make Indian economy UDS 5 trillion, North East has to contribute substantially. In response to Chief Minister\u2019s request, the Union Minister said that his ministry would do the needful for capacity enhancement of Digboi Refinery.Considering the huge reservoir of hydrocarbon reserves in the North East, Puri said Centre will help the region in tapping the hydrocarbon resources to catalyze the growth of North East region and improve the standard of living of the people and creating a sustainable energy for the future.Union Minister of State for Railways and Textiles Darshana Jardosh who is in Guwahati met Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at the latter\u2019s official residence in capital complex and they discussed on some railway important projects being implemented in Assam. Sarma during the discussion, requested the Union Minister to expedite the electrification work in Assam part of the North East Frontier Railway (NFR). He also requested the Union Minister to expedite the work of double tracking. He requested her to extend the double track project up to Dibrugarh.Moreover, in view of repeated elephant deaths primarily caused by railway accidents in Deepor Beel area, Sarma requested the Union Minister to help constructing an elevated corridor to give an obstruction free passage to the tuskers. With regard to under-construction flyovers over the railway tracks at some areas of the state, Chief Minister Sarma requested the Union Minister to impress the authority of NFR to resolve the issues obstructing the completion of the flyovers. Sarma also requested the Union Minister to increase the running frequency of Rajdhani Express between New Delhi and Agartala via Barak Valley for the convenience of the passengers. Sarma requested the Union Minister to set up an Indian Institute of Fashion Technology in Guwahati. He sought her ministry\u2019s intervention to help the textile industry in Assam with modern technology and help the Assam weavers\u2019 creation occupy global market. Senior officers of State government and railways were also present during the meeting.",

        "articleBody": "Tech firm Honeywell International Inc and consulting and engineering company Wood are set to launch a technology solution to help companies reduce carbon intensity when making sustainable aviation fuel, the partners said on Thursday.The solution could benefit producers of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, as they could be eligible for greater subsidies for making the fuel if they can limit carbon intensity during production.The development - shared with Reuters before its official launch - comes as the Biden administration is setting targets to help boost SAF production to shift the aviation industry away from using traditional petroleum-based jet fuel to cut emissions.Sustainable aviation fuel can be made with feedstocks like cooking oil, animal fat and soybean oil. Production of the fuel is still miniscule compared to traditional jet fuel.The two companies are combining on a process that pairs production processing from Honeywell with Wood's hydrogen plant technology. They said it can significantly reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, especially when using certain feedstocks, compared to emissions when producing traditional jet fuel.Honeywell's production process converts waste oils, fats and greases into SAF. Its technology is used in all licensed renewable jet fuel production in the world today, Honeywell and Wood said in a prepared press release seen by Reuters.As part of the production process, technology from Wood will be integrated to use byproducts of the process technology to produce renewable hydrogen. The renewable hydrogen is then injected back into the Honeywell production process to remove feed impurities and create a cleaner burning renewable fuel, the release showed.The carbon dioxide generated from production of the hydrogen can be captured and routed for permanent underground sequestration using Honeywell's technology. The government incentives here are very supportive, but the economics improve greatly as you reduce carbon intensities,  said Ben Owens, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions. He said the companies are in talks with current producers of sustainable aviation fuel.Earlier this month, the White House said it is targeting 20% lower aviation emissions by 2030, as airlines pledged to use more SAF.

On Monday, talking at the JP Morgan India Investor Summit he said that group will make the mega investment across the clean energy value chain.\u201cOver 75% of our planned capex until 2025 will be in green technologies,\u201d Adani said.\u201cOver the next 10 years, we will invest over 20 billion dollars across renewable energy generation, component manufacturing, transmission & distribution.\u201dEarlier this year in June, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said that Reliance Industries, a recent entrant in the clean energy space, will investment of Rs 75,000 crore ($10 billion) over the next three years to build a new clean energy business to fuel its commitment to be net carbon neutral by2035.\u201cWe will triple our renewable power generation capacity over the next four years \u2013 from 21% now to a high of 63%. No company is building at this scale,\u201d Adani said.Adani said that there was an urgent need for countries to collectively work to mitigate the climate change risks. \u201cAs if the pandemic were not enough, yet another challenge looms ahead of us and India will have to play a major balancing role. If the crisis in 2001 was the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and in 2007 the bursting of the housing bubble, and if in 2020 the crisis was the pandemic, we now have to collectively confront and manage the crisis of climate change,\u201d he said.But he criticized the developed nations their expectations from developing economies like India and their  impractical  suggestions of alternatives to deal with climate change even as  west sits on a carpet of carbon soot several centuries deep.\u201dHe said there is a need for a more equitable solution.\u201cThose criticising our reluctance to directly adopt western advice on climate change must deeply consider the disparity in the situation. It is impractical to suggest alternatives that the developing world does not have, cannot use, and cannot afford,\u201d Adani said.Speaking of the group\u2019s other businesses, Adani said that it will continue to focus on infrastructure sectors that are underserved, and grow by expanding into adjacent sectors and incubate new businesses within Adani Enterprises, which when ready will be spun off as independent publicly traded companies.\u201cWe will be the first port business that is ahead of its target to get to net zero by 2025\u2026We will be the first Indian data centre company that will power all its data centres with renewable energy by 2030,\u201d Adani said.Adani said that the company has big plans to expand two of its new businesses\u2014airports and digital business. \u201cWe will not only scale the existing (Mumbai) airport but also operationalize the Navi Mumbai International Airport by 2024,\u201d he said.The digital business will include all of the group\u2019s digital-related ventures-- data centres, industrial clouds, and the Adani Digital Labs. Earlier this year we established Adani Digital Labs as a part of Adani Enterprises to be able to provide a unified experience to all our end consumers.",

        "articleBody": "Unveiling his infrastructure conglomerate's green vision, billionaire Gautam Adani on Tuesday said his group will invest USD 20 billion over the next 10 years in renewable energy generation and component manufacturing and will produce the world's cheapest green electron. The port-to-energy conglomerate plans to triple its renewable power generation capacity over the next four years, foray into green hydrogen production, power all data centres with renewable energy, turn its ports into net carbon zero by 2025, and plans to spend over 75 per cent of capital expenditure until 2025 in green technologies, he said.  Speaking at JP Morgan India Investor Summit, Adani Group chairman said the USD 20 billion investment will be in renewable energy generation, component manufacturing, transmission and distribution.  Adani Group's  integrated value chain, our scale, and experience puts us on the path to be the producer of the least expensive green electron anywhere in the world,  he said.  The announcement came weeks after India's richest man Mukesh Ambani announced an investment of Rs 75,000 crore (USD 10 billion) in clean power and hydrogen fuel over three years.  Many have seen the June 24 announcement as the petrochemical czar's direct competition with the country's second-wealthiest man, Adani who has had a strong presence in the renewables space for many years.  This month, Ambani said hydrogen can be made from renewable energy at USD 1 per kilogram in a decade's time.  Hydrogen has no carbon emissions and can be used as fuel in industry and automobiles.  And on Tuesday, Adani outlined his vision with an investment size of USD 20 billion and the cheapest green electron.  He said no company in the world is building a renewable power portfolio on the scale the Adani group is doing.  The group currently has 4,920 MW of operational renewable energy generation capacity and another 5,124 MW under execution. It has a confirmed pipeline of 9,750 MW and another 4,500 MW where it is likely to win contracts.   Today, we are already the world's largest solar power player when we account for our generating, under construction, and contracted projects. We have done this in just two years and our renewables portfolio has reached our initial target of 25 Gigawatts a full four years ahead of schedule. This puts us well on track to be the world's largest renewable power generating company by 2030,  he said.  This, he said, opens up several new pathways including  setting us up to be one of the largest green hydrogen producers in the world.   He however did not elaborate on plans to produce hydrogen.   Our actions clearly indicate that we are putting our money where our mouth is: Over 75 per cent of our planned capex until 2025 will be in green technologies. Today, of our EBITDA from utilities, 43 per cent is already from the green business.   The group will triple renewable power generation capacity over the next four years - from 21 per cent now to a high of 63 per cent.  Over the next 10 years, we will invest over USD 20 billion across renewable energy generation, component manufacturing, transmission and distribution,  he said.   We will be the first port business that is ahead of its target to get to net zero by 2025. This business has committed to 1.5-degree pathway through SBTi.   It will also be the first Indian data centre company that will power all its data centres with renewable energy by 2030.  On other businesses, Adani said the focus will continue to be on infrastructure sectors that are underserved and critical to nation-building.   We are now India's largest private sector power producer, largest private port operator, largest private airport operator, largest private consumer gas and electric utility business, largest private electric transmission company and largest infrastructure developer in renewables.   The group would also grow by expanding into adjacent sectors and incubate new businesses. It will in each of its businesses, develop deep operational expertise and then grow aggressively, both organically and through acquisitions.   In just the last eight years, we have acquired over 50 assets amounting to about USD 12 billion,  he said.  On digital business, he said the Adani Group's plans for airport-centered growth include metropolitan developments that span entertainment facilities, e-commerce and logistics capabilities, aviation-dependent industries and smart city developments.  Adani said over the next two decades, India will have the biggest and youngest middle class that has ever existed. Over the next decade it will be among the world's top four countries in terms of market capitalization.  This is leverage from which we must benefit.   India, he said, will be driven by homegrown companies and those international businesses that are truly committed to being and acting local.   But, as if the pandemic were not enough, yet another challenge looms ahead of us and India will have to play a major balancing role. If the crisis in 2001 was the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and in 2007 the bursting of the housing bubble, and if in 2020 the crisis was the pandemic, we now have to collectively confront and manage the crisis of climate change,  he said.  Managing the climate crisis will require every country in the world to unite, perhaps like never before, and work together.   Those criticising the pace of climate reform in countries like India must remember that the economic and industrial might of the West sits on a carpet of carbon soot several centuries deep. A hundred years ago, today's climate reformers were burning over 800 million metric tonnes of coal - that is more coal than what India produces today,  he said.  From pre-industrial times until now, India accounts for only 3 per cent of the extra carbon in the atmosphere and will eventually end up consuming less than 8 per cent of the entire remaining carbon budget, he said.",

        "articleBody": "Despite a failed attempt at finding a suitable partner, Malaysia's state-owned Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) will look at India to form a  substantial  part of its 3 gigawatt (GW) renewable energy target, a top executive said.The oil and gas giant said it will be looking at traditional renewable energy projects such as wind and solar, but will also venture into other sustainable initiatives to further expand presence in green technologies.  We're looking at (solar and wind) as part of the growth, but also some of the other adjacent technologies such as energy storage, battery energy storage, EVs (electric vehicles), and even looking at things on the distributed energy demand side as well,  Jay Mariyappan, head of new energy at Petronas, told ET.  86385803 The main aim is that we will look to grow. Our overall target is three gigawatts by 2024 in terms of capacity; a substantial part of that will be within India,  Mariyappan said, without specifying how much of the 3 GW will come from India.Petronas was in talks with the Tatas that would have resulted in a $2 billion investment deal into Tata Power's renewable energy-focused investment infrastructure trust (InvIT). However, the year-long negotiation was abruptly called off during its final stages in April this year. ET was the first to break that story. Speaking from Singapore, Mariyappan refused to comment on the failed deal, but said Petronas will continue to look for other partners in India.  We don't comment on specific transactions, but what we can share is that we continue to explore other opportunities, where we are open to collaborate with any party with the right credentials in this field in India, as well as other parts of Asia Pacific,  he said.  So, in this regard, we welcome any party that has experience in developing large scale solar offshore and onshore wind, as well as energy storage to explore partnerships and to establish greater access to renewable energy,  he said.Plan for Amplus In India, Petronas operates in the renewable energy sector through Amplus Solar, a leading rooftop and commercial and industrial (C&I) player that it acquired in 2019 in a deal worth \u20b92,700 crore.Last year, Amplus bought 100 MW of solar assets from Acme. Mariyappan said while greenfield projects through Amplus's headway into open access solar rooftop will be the main path to expansion in India, he did not rule out acquisitions like that from Acme.He declined to disclose any investment numbers the company has in mind for India.At this time, Petronas through Amplus will not be looking at getting into manufacturing of solar panels, Mariyappan said.Plans for hydrogenCurrently, Petronas only produces hydrogen as a fuel source in Malaysia. If we see more demand from our customers for hydrogen, that's where we will obviously increase our production capabilities. So if that's in India or elsewhere, and it can be delivered to customers cost effectively and safely, then that's an area that we will explore,  Mariyappan said, adding that the company would be open to setting up manufacturing in India and importing hydrogen with the right partner.",

        "articleBody": "Adoption of hybrid energy sources worldwide can help meet the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, an industry executive said on Friday.Hybrid energy systems are defined as the integration of several types of energy generation equipment such as electrical energy generators, electrical energy storage systems, and renewable energy sources. As we progress to meet our 2050 goal of carbon neutrality and zero carbon emission, we have to think of hybrid energy sources,  Alok Nanda, CEO, GE India Technology Centre & CTO, GE South Asia said in a virtual address at the 17th Edition of India Innovation Summit.Nanda said climate change is a real concern, and energy transitions being made today must be done keeping needs of future generations in mind.He said one of the primary reasons for the climate change is that 41 per cent of the co2 (carbon) emission is generated by the power sector, while 26 per cent by the industry, 25 pc by transport, and 9 per cent by buildings. If you come to transport, we have talked about e-cars a lot but if those e-cars batteries are charged by electricity generated by a technology that produces a lot of carbon then... we actually would be polluting our environment (indirectly). We need a holistic approach,  Nanda said.Explaining further, he said if all coal plants are replaced by equivalent capacity of renewable energy, it will lead to a carbon reduction by 25-40 per cent. If the coal plants in the world are replaced by equivalent capacity of gas turbines or gas plants, the co2 emission would be reduced by 50-60 per cent. We will have to work towards hybrids. hybrids are inevitable and as we progress towards it we can make real change while achieving energy trilemma by making electricity affordable, reliable and sustainable while meeting energy security needs and then we add carbon capture and hydrogen to this mix and take this (carbon reduction) to 100 pc which is the need,  he said.",

The entrepreneur is confident that the autonomous, or driverless, system may well be in a position to transport humans in the future, following its successful use to transport products.   It's not just #JetZero. Oceanways has assembled a world-class team to pioneer #SubZero by creating the new market of net positive underwater transport systems with zero-emission cargo submarines as an innovative tool to decarbonise shipping and clean up our ocean,  he said.  The green submarines are expected to be in use across British waters by 2026 and help address freight traffic challenges, including shortage of drivers. Oceanways says it will be servicing short point to point routes with fast, zero emission delivery. It claims the submarines are superior to a cargo ship in almost every way:  not only they are weather independent, can reach hard to reach areas and a lot cheaper to build and operate, but it's also quieter, secure, more stable, and cleaner, with zero fumes or pollutants .   As a proud island nation built on our maritime prowess, it is only right that we lead by example when it comes to decarbonising the sector and building back greener,  said Shapps, the minister who unveiled the prize-winners during the ongoing London Shipping Week in Greenwich.   The projects announced today showcase the best of British innovation, revolutionising\u202fexisting\u202ftechnology\u202fand infrastructure to slash\u202femissions, create jobs and\u202fget us another step closer to our decarbonisation targets,  he said.  The government's Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition is supporting the\u202fdevelopment of innovative technology to propel Prime Minister Boris Johnson's commitment to have\u202fzero\u202femission\u202fships\u202foperating\u202fcommercially\u202fby 2025.  Also among the winners is an all-electric\u202fcharge-point\u202fconnected to an offshore\u202fwind turbine.\u202fThe\u202fcharge-points will be able to power\u202fboats using 100 per cent renewable energy\u202fgenerated from the turbine.  This offers potential savings of up to 131,100 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions a year - the equivalent of removing over 62,000 cars from our roads. Similar to roadside electric vehicle chargepoints, these will be operated by\u202fsemi-automated control, meaning that sailors can moor up by the wind turbine chargepoint, plug in, charge up, then sail on.   Through increased investment and closer collaboration with government our industry can rise to the challenge of steering the UK's vessels in a green direction,  said Maritime UK chair Sarah Kenny.   We still have a very long way to go, but today marks an important step towards our journey to net zero,  she said.  It comes as UK Maritime Minister Robert Courts backed the opening of the UK's so-called greenest cruise terminal. The Horizon Cruise Terminal at the Port of Southampton, southern England, is the first of its kind, using an innovative mix of solar panel roofing and clean energy shore power plug-in charging for ships.",

The depleted CO2 gas is sent back to the gas network with increased calorific value. This project has been executed with technological support from Carbon Clean, a global leader in low-cost CO2 capture technology.The CCU plant was inaugurated by T.V. Narendran, CEO and MD, Tata Steel, in the presence of company officials and other dignitaries. In alignment with the Tata group's pioneering values, we have taken this strategic step in our journey towards decarbonisation. We will continue our quest to remain an industry leader in sustainability by setting new benchmarks for a better tomorrow,  Narendran said. The operational experience gathered from this 5 TPD CO2 capture plant will give us the required data and confidence to establish larger carbon capture plants in future. As a next step, we aim to establish scaled up facilities of CO2 capture integrated with utilisation avenues,  he added.Aniruddha Sharma, CEO, Carbon Clean, said:  We are delighted to be working with Tata Steel on this breakthrough project. We are currently capturing 5 tonnes of CO2 per day, but following our successful demonstration, we plan to rapidly accelerate the number of carbon capture projects. Capturing CO2 from blast furnace gas will not only decarbonise the steel plants, but will also open avenues for hydrogen economy. Carbon capture and utilisation is a key lever in the fight against climate change and global warming.In September 2020, Tata Steel had joined hands with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to work in the field of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), to build a strong ecosystem in the country for meeting the decarbonisation commitments under the Paris Agreement.",

        "articleBody": "India is planning to establish 5 GW electrolyser manufacturing capacity in the first phase of the green hydrogen mission, among the largest in the world at almost 10 times the present global capacity.The electrolyser manufacturing programme is expected to be in phases and the first phase itself is likely to be among the largest in the world at 5 GW by 2030. The final scale is likely to be a lot higher as the country is looking at large capacities for economies of scale, a senior official said.Electrolysers are used to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen and a production-linked incentive scheme for their manufacturing is part of the country\u2019s ambitious green hydrogen mission that is expected to be launched next fiscal. Several countries have planned pilot manufacturing programmes of 250 MW and 500 MW. Green hydrogen costs, on average, between two and three times more to make than blue hydrogen mainly because of high electrolyser costs, whose manufacturing capacity across the world is limited too.\u201cCountries have announced aspirational targets so far. India targets to be an early mover in the green hydrogen and green ammonia industry to gain an early mover edge over others,\u201d the official said.The green hydro and ammonia purchase obligations are proposed to be fixed on oil refineries and fertiliser units. \u201cWe need to select sectors where the impact on cost is the least but visibility is the highest. We have selected refineries and fertilisers. Some pockets within these sectors will be exempt and some will be targeted aggressively. For example, there are units which import ammonia, which we can replace with green hydrogen.\u201cGoing forward as we are able to increase the scale and reduce costs, it can be extended to sectors like heavy transportation and steel. We expect these sectors to be the biggest consumers of green hydrogen in the next 10-15 years,\u201d he said.Power and new and renewable energy minister R K Singh has recently said the obligated industries will need 8,800 MW electrolyser capacity if they are mandated to source 10% of their requirements through green hydrogen. He said the mandates can be raised to as high as 20-25% over the course of the hydrogen mission. The comprehensive mission is expected to have two important aspects, mandates for consumption of green hydrogen and green ammonia and, a production-linked incentive for equalisers for large-scale manufacturing to lower costs.An early mover advantage can help Indian industry gain edge over competitors in the world, the official said. The International Maritime Organisation has targeted shifting 50% of its operations to green fuel by 2035. The European Union has announced plans to install 6,000 MW of electrolyser capacity by 2024 and 40,000 MW by 2030 to produce 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani recently said the company targets bringing down the cost of green hydrogen to under $2 per kg. Indian Oil, NTPC, JSW Energy and Acme Solar have also announced their forays in the segment.\u201cIn the past few years, mass deployment of renewable energy in India helped us produce electricity cheaper than any other sources. For green hydrogen and green ammonia also, initially, government policies will drive the demand. Gradually, building more capacity will improve learning and advancement of technology will make the product popular and customers will accept it,\u201d said Manoj K Upadhyay, founder and chairman, ACME Group. The company is in the final stages of setting up a green hydrogen and ammonia plant in Rajasthan. Another $3.5 billion project is planned in Oman.On Monday, during his meeting with a delegation led by US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, minister R K Singh invited US companies to participate in the large bids for green hydrogen and electrolysers.US-based Ohmium International has also recently launched India\u2019s first green hydrogen electrolyser gigafactory in Bengaluru.",

        "articleBody": "Harvard University will divest itself from holdings in fossil fuels, President Lawrence Bacow said Thursday. Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university's nearly $42 billion endowment, has already been reducing its exposure to fossil fuels and has no direct investments in companies that explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels, Bacow said in a message posted on the university's website. The university has legacy investments in a number of private equity funds with holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Those indirect investments constitute less than 2% of the endowment, according to Bacow. The school has not made any new commitments to these limited partnerships since 2019 and has no intention to do so going forward, he added. Bacow said the legacy investments are in  runoff mode  and will end as these partnerships are liquidated. Harvard has already committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire investment portfolio by 2050, he said.  Given the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries to make long-term investment decisions that support our teaching and research mission, we do not believe such investments are prudent,  he wrote. The decision follows years of protests from students who have pressed Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies. Harvard is building a portfolio of investments in funds that support the transition to a green economy, Bacow wrote. He said the university has made investments along with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in The Engine, a fund that, among other things,  seeks to accelerate the development of technologies that promise to address the challenges posed by climate change.  The university will also work to achieve  greater transparency in the greenhouse gas footprint of all of our investment managers, along with the development of protocols for assessing and reducing the footprint for entire investment portfolios.  he wrote.  We must continue to work with our investment managers and with industry if we are to bring about the transformation of our economy that climate change demands,  he added.",

        "articleBody": "Barely a month after the Indian Railways Organization of Alternate Fuel (IROAF), a green fuel vertical of the Railways, invited bids for hydrogen fuel cell-based technology for trains, the national transporter has issued an order to shut down the organisation. This was done through an order issued on September 7. The Railways, however, said that ongoing projects or contracts will not be affected in any way.  Ministry of Railways has decided to close down the Indian Railways Organization for Alternate Fuels' with effect from September 7, 2021,  the order stated.  Only administrative change. Projects will be executed as usual,  the Railways said. The order has also stated that the work of IROAF will be transferred to the Northern Railways and the Railway Board. The solar power rolling stock or the Alternate Fuel Electrical Directorate of the organisation will be transferred to the Railway Board. Its existing tenders and contracts, if any, about solar power will be handled by the Northern Railway. All work related to hydrogen fuel cells, including their tenders, will be transferred to the Northern Railways. Last month, the ministry had said that under the project to run hydrogen trains, two DEMU rakes will be converted at first to use hydrogen as fuel. Rs 8 crore has been set aside for this phase in the current year. Later, two hybrid narrow gauge locomotives will be retrofitted with hydrogen fuel cell power movement. Using hydrogen will be a major step towards lowering pollution from trains as the gas is known to be the greenest transport fuel. Hydrogen can be generated easily by electrolysing the water from solar energy, the ministry had stated earlier.",

        "articleBody": "From the price action, you\u2019d think that fossil fuels are back in business. Since breaking above $100 a metric ton in May, the price of coal at Australia\u2019s Newcastle port \u2014 a benchmark for Asia, which consumes about three-quarters of the world\u2019s soot \u2014 has gone almost vertical, hitting a record $173.10 a ton Thursday. The key regional contract for liquefied natural gas, the Japan-Korea Marker, is in similar territory, hitting $18.02 per million British thermal units the same day. That\u2019s not a record, but it\u2019s still the third-highest spike LNG has ever seen, during what\u2019s typically the low season for a commodity that tends to surge amid winter\u2019s heating demands.   85967683If you think of futures prices simply as a vote on the path ahead for the commodity in question, that should worry a world that needs to decarbonize. This view is simplistic, though. Commodity prices don\u2019t rise and fall based on the level of demand itself, but rather as a result of the mismatch between demand and supply. A world in which fossil fuel consumption is on a long-term downtrend can still see handsome prices for fossil fuels in any period when supply falls faster than demand.The current price spike has multiple sources. One is the diversion of Russian gas from Europe to Asia, while another is China\u2019s coal-to-gas switch. Then there\u2019s the relatively warm, dry summer that\u2019s reduced hydro generation and increased pressure on air conditioners. Most important, though, has been the bounce back from 2020\u2019s bout of economic sickness, which has sent electricity consumption surging \u2014 and with it, the dirtiest forms of generation.One of the biggest drivers for growth in renewable power\u2019s energy share over the past decade has been flat or declining electricity demand. Adding wind and solar capable of supplying 5% of a country\u2019s grid power can drive a sharp reduction in emissions if output remains constant or falls. If, however, grid use climbs 5%, then all that new renewable capacity won\u2019t make a shred of difference to emissions. If it climbs 14% year-on-year \u2014 as China\u2019s did in July \u2014 then it\u2019s likely to be fossil fuels that make up the shortfall.  85967698That situation can turn even the economic disadvantages of coal and gas in their favor. For years now, the growth of renewable power with zero fuel costs has been pushing thermal generators out of use, dealing a severe blow to their economics. Fossil power plants need to be in operation for 60% to 80% of the time to turn a profit, but the last time China\u2019s fleet hit that level was all the way back in 2011. For most of 2019 and 2020, the figure was well below 50%. That very underutilization, however, means that there\u2019s substantial ability to turn up the gas when demand starts surging. Delivering an extra megawatt-hour from a thermal generator operating at half capacity only requires finding some fuel on the global markets for coal and LNG. If you want to increase wind and solar generation beyond current levels, you\u2019ll need to build a whole new power plant.That sounds like bad news for decarbonization \u2014 and in the short term, it is. Still, the current price spikes also provide a reminder to generators of why the days of thermal power are numbered. At current prices for Newcastle coal, even the most efficient power plant will be paying upwards of $60 per megawatt hour just for its fuel. In the largest markets of China and India, the cost of brand-new wind or solar generation is half as much, or less. Even renewable power plants backed up with batteries to provide on-demand electricity are competitive with fossil fuels at current prices.  85967711That\u2019s the ultimate reason why the world will switch away from the historic role of carbon as the solid base of electricity systems over the coming decade. Renewable generation is priced at the time of installation, and doesn\u2019t vary in cost over a multi-decade project life. That gives enviable certainty to grid operators whose revenues are typically fixed by the government, especially when compared to commodities like coal, whose price can increase threefold in 12 months, as they did over the past year.As lenders withdraw finance from fossil fuel projects and major producers shift toward lower-carbon alternatives, those problems will only be accentuated, with supply-demand mismatches increasingly leading to volatile fuel prices that will play havoc with generators\u2019 cashflows. Stability and certainty have always been valued qualities in business. The very ungoverned excitement of energy fuel markets now contains the seeds of their own decline.(Views are personal)",

        "articleBody": "Until four years ago, garbage disposal meant one thing to Savitri Bai Patil - stinking, putrefied heaps of trash spread around her neighbourhood in Pune, in western India.But now the streets of the Ashok Meadows housing complex where she lives are clear, with workers picking up garbage from residents' doorsteps each day and turning some of it into electricity.Since 2017, the complex has fed its food waste into a digester that converts it into biogas used to light the area's streetlights, park, social club and gym. Clean energy from our rancid food leftovers, vegetable peels and other such throwaways? It is unbelievable how the concept of waste management has changed in the past few years,  Bai Patil, 62, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Biogas generators like the one used in Ashok Meadows are now installed in more than 75 locations across India.Developed by Xeon Waste Managers (XWM), based in Pune, the EnergyBin systems let communities turn waste into free, renewable energy, said company president Jalaj Kumar Chaturvedi. It is a common sight to find overburdened landfills with garbage that grows by the day. But since these EnergyBins dispose of the waste at the source itself, the landfills are spared,  he said.According to Ashok Meadows resident Rishika Mahalley, the complex's system - operated and maintained by residents - has helped solve the problem of how to dispose of the nearly a tonne of garbage produced each day by the complex's 550 homes and common areas.Before the community bought the generator at the cost of 2.3 million Indian rupees ($31,000), it struggled with unreliable municipal garbage collection, which often left waste piling up, Mahalley noted.But  we have now gotten rid of the buzzing flies, scourge of mosquitoes and other insects, besides of course the stink that came from the vats where the garbage would be left until the municipal vehicles arrived to collect them,  she said.FOOD TO FUELEach day, waste pickers paid by the Ashok Meadows residents put between 550 kg and 600 kg (1,300 pounds) of food waste into the biogas plant, Mahalley said.As the organic matter breaks down it produces a flammable gas made up mainly of methane and carbon dioxide.The methane is then pressurized and piped into a power generator that burns the gas to convert it into 50 kilowatt-hours of electricity for the community each day.Mahalley said before the plant was installed the complex spend about 550 rupees ($7.50) a day on electricity for streetlights and other common facilities - a cost that has now virtually disappeared.It also saves the residents up to Rs 6,000 ($82) every month on municipal garbage disposal costs, she said.COSTSThe biggest benefit of biogas plants - which are becoming increasingly popular around the world as a way to create climate-smart energy - is their ability to reduce emissions, said Jitendra S. Sangwai, a chemical engineering professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai.In particular, by capturing climate-changing gases that would normally be released into the atmosphere when organic matter decays in the open, such technology can curb emissions of methane gas, a potent short-term driver of climate change.While many small-scale biogas digesters are in operation around the globe, for now the costs and climate benefits of large biogas generators like EnergyBins are limited to communities that can afford them, Sangwai added.The systems can be expensive to buy, set up and maintain, he said.But XWM president Chaturvedi said the digesters provide multiple benefits.Besides cutting electricity and rubbish collection costs, some municipalities can tap into property tax rebates offered to residents who process their own organic waste, part of an effort to ease the heavy burden on landfills, he said. With that tax concession and the other savings, the generators pay for themselves in three years,  he said.GREEN GARBAGE DISPOSALAt the South Eastern Railways (SER) headquarters, a complex of offices and staff residences in Kolkata, a 1,000-kg-capacity XWM biogas generator has been operating since January 2020.It services a complex that houses 1,200 homes, a market, a social club and a hospital, which has a kitchen that generates food waste throughout the day.Prior to the installation of the digester, a once-daily municipal collection was not enough to get rid of all of the food leftovers produced, said the hospital's senior dietician Dr. Sanchita Mazumder. It was a nightmare to dispose of so much waste. We had to dig holes in the backyard to dump it,  she said, adding that stray animals would then dig up the garbage and spread it around the complex.That has not been a problem since the biogas unit was installed, she said, noting that the gas generated from the kitchen's garbage has helped the hospital reduce its use of LPG gas for cooking by 80%.Having a better way to dispose of waste has also cut littering around the complex, said Altaf Hussain, head of the SER conservancy department. The best part is how the community is learning to adopt clean garbage disposal methods,  he said.",

We need to cooperate across borders to achieve our goals,\u201d said Tina Bru, Norway\u2019s Minister of Petroleum and Energy in her video address.Partnerships in developing hydrogen as an important component of the energy basket and the transition to a decarbonized economy was among the issues raised by UK minister and COP 26 President Alok Sharma during his visit to India in August.Drawing on the economic potential of green hydrogen, Bru said that the shift will open up opportunities for new industries, jobs and economic growth. \u201cHydrogen has the potential to realise low to zero-emission solutions in the transportation, industry and shipping sectors making a foundation for numerous green jobs,\u201d Norwegian minister said.The conference builds on Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcement of a national hydrogen mission in his Independence Day address. Stressing on the need for self-reliance in meeting energy demands and the urgent need to tackle climate change, Modi had spoken about transforming India into a global green hydrogen hub for production and exports.\u201cGreen hydrogen will not only enable us to reduce emission but also help India across several verticals and align with PM Modi's vision of our nation being self-reliant,\u201d said Singh in his address. Drawing attention to the opportunities, the science and technology minister said, \u201cwe have the capability and the capacity to facilitate clean hydrogen energy for the world; this is the appropriate time to get into action and create a world worth thriving in.\u201dEchoing the sentiments, Ashwini Choubey, Minister of State for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said \u201cThe need of the hour is to create a su Release of a Knowledge Book titled 'Self Reliant India - Harnessing the Power of Hydrogen'. A guide on energy transformation from fossil fuels to greener options, the book is the outcome of an Indo-Norwegian collaboration.The summit aimed to serve a platform for engagement to build partnerships and an ecosystem for green hydrogen. Initiatives focusing on knowledge sharing, capacity building, industry and manufacturing, collaboration in research and development, transforming the transport sector were announced at the summit.To improve access to information, the National Hydrogen Portal, a one-stop option to access research and developments on hydrogen was launched. Norway and India announced the plan to set up collaborative hydrogen competence centres. Set up jointly by government institutions and agencies, industry, research institutions from the two countries, the focus is capacity building\u2014creating a quali?ed workforce of engineers and technicians that will be the backbone of the hydrogen ecosystem.With an eye to ensure that hydrogen based solutions are adopted on scale and recognizing that no one country or company could offer solutions across the hydrogen value chain, the summit proposed setting up an International Hydrogen Alliance.On the business end, joint ventures to step up manufacturing of fuel cells, storage and transport applications were proposed. The transport sector emerged as focus area. The idea is to explore the use of hydrogen as fuel for the transportation sector including local public passenger transport, heavy-duty road transport and commercial vehicles, as well as marine, rail, and possibly, aviation.

He said the country has already achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy.  India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for renewable energy. The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight,  said Ambani in his address at International Climate Summit 2021 today.  Sharing his perspective on making the country a global leader in green energy revolution in forthcoming years, he said that by taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5 per cent of our land. Last year, Ambani had announced to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the new energy business which will be the next big value creation engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar,  said Ambani.  He also said that Reliance will establish and enable at least 100 GW of solar energy by 2030.   This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption. This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India,  said the RIL Chairman. ",

Ambani said that while the world is making efforts to make green hydrogen the most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under $2 per kg, India can set an \u201caggressive target\u201d for breaching the $ 1 mark. \u201cEfforts are on globally to make green hydrogen the most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under $ 2 per kg. Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade,\u201d Ambani said at the International Climate Summit 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a National Hydrogen Mission for the country, in an attempt to push energy security for the country. Energy experts believe that clean energy sources like hydrogen technology would be at core for the global effort to move towards net zero carbon.\u201cIndia has always set and achieved even more audacious goals. Am sure that India can set an even more aggressive target of achieving under $ 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade \u2013 the 1-1-1 target for green hydrogen,\u201d Ambani said. Earlier this year, Ambani announced RIL\u2019s clean energy business plan that will entail three parts \u2014 a Rs 60,000-core investment in four giga-factories that will manufacture and fully integrate all critical components for the business; a Rs 15,000-crore infusion in building the value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries; and repurposing the company\u2019s engineering, project management and construction capabilities toward clean energy.The company has already started work to build the four giga-factories-- an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory, an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyser factory for the production of green hydrogen, and a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into power. Global energy majors are making a move towards cleaner fuels as climate change concerns are pushing countries to take measures. Pension funds, insurers and other environmentally conscious investors are changing their portfolio in favour of clean energy, pushing companies to scale up their exposure to clean energy.",

        "articleBody": "The introduction of a new type of petrol, E10, in the UK may create some extra costs for owners of older cars, but the aim is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.E10 is an automotive fuel made up of 90% regular unleaded petrol and 10% ethanol, hence the E10 name.Ethanol is an alcohol (also called ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol) that is produced both as a petrochemical or via biological processes, from plants, including sugar beet and wheat. It is possible to run cars on pure ethanol, as has been done in Brazil for decades, but in the UK it is blended with fuel derived from oil. Current petrol grades in the UK (E5) contain up to 5% ethanol, with the other 95% being regular unleaded petrol.The UK government argues that the use of E10 petrol is an environmental move to reduce CO2 emissions. The government states that by doubling the proportion of the renewable component (the ethanol) in the fuel a 750,000 tonne reduction in CO2 could achieved, which may be the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road.Fuel made from plantsThe goal is to use exclusively plant-based ethanol to make E10. One benefit is as the plants that will become the fuel grow, they absorb more carbon dioxide than what will be released into the air during fuel production and combustion, lowering emissions. But by how much that happens is still an active topic of debate. The concept is good, but the source of ethanol makes a critical difference.Previously, studies suggested that ethanol made from corn reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to gasoline. The calculations of CO2 suggest that corn ethanol is carbon negative - but if you look at the whole picture it is actually carbon positive when you consider the changes in land from its production and the loss of other carbon capture by whatever you replace the corn with.There is also a fear that crops would be used to make fuel for the rich, while the poor starved, a July 2008 report found that between 2002 and 2008 biofuels accounted for 70% price increases in foods such corn and sugar beet globally.If global CO2 emissions are to be reduced by use of E10, then ethanol must not compete with food production. For instance, making ethanol from waste products, including those produced from a combination of wine unsuitable for human consumption, and whey, a by-product of cheese manufacturing, will not cause food prices to rise.Ethanol is easy to blend with other fuels to prevent engine knocking and enhance a car's performance. It's not all good news though. As a fuel, E10 is slightly less energy dense, meaning it could reduce the miles per gallon your car achieves by up to 1%.What's not widely known is that since 2016 new cars have been certified for emissions and performance using E10 fuel, so when you bought a car and were told how many miles to the gallon it would do, that number was already based on using this new fuel.All cars registered since 2011 are required to be E10 compatible, so where the potential issues arise is for owners of older and classic cars. Although, the government has provided an online E10 checker as an easy means of finding out if your car copes well with E10.The RAC estimates that as many as 600,000 vehicles currently on UK roads aren't compatible with E10. Drivers of cars registered prior to 2002 are advised not to use E10 in their vehicles, as problems have been reported.If you put E10 fuel in an incompatible car it will still run, but seals, plastics and metals may be damaged over longer periods as a result of ethanol's corrosive properties. Ethanol is also a hygroscopic \u2013 which means it absorbs water from the atmosphere, leading to condensation in fuel tanks if the car remains unused for long periods of time.In addition to running issues caused by the mixture of E10, information issued by the Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs confirms that the increased acidity, conductivity and chloride content of ethanol in E10 can cause corrosion and tarnishing of metal components (such as carburetors, fuel pumps, and older fuel tanks). While corrosion inhibitor additives can control this, the same cannot yet be said for its compatibility with seals, flexible pipes and other unsuitable gasket materials.So what options do owners of traditional classic cars have? Well the good news is that the technology exists to upgrade the fuel systems to cope with the new fuel. At one extreme, Prince Charles had his beloved Aston Martin DB6 updated to run on bio-E85, a blend of 85% ethanol fuel and 15% gasoline, but at a minimum it is good practice for classic owners to renew ancient fuel lines as a precaution in any case. A modern fuel hose sold by a reputable supplier is advised for use with E10.Price gaps in rural areasCurrent regulations require larger forecourts selling two grades of petrol to continue selling E5 fuel. This will be offered only in the more expensive super unleaded grade however, which brings its own problems: in rural areas it may be hard to find a retailer large enough to stock it. Super unleaded is also a more expensive fuel, with the price gap potentially set to widen further in time.If consumers are to be comfortable with E10 then they will need to be reassured that it will work in their cars, but some people may also be concerned about source of the ethanol. The former is information widely available, but the latter is something the suppliers are going to have to come to terms with in the same way that the grocery store chains now tell us the region of food production.(This article is syndicated by PTI from The Conversation)",

Sprng Energy added a portfolio through multiple acquisitions such as 600 megawatt assets from Acme Cleantech for Rs 3,000 crore last year and 194 MW solar energy portfolio of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group in 2019.The company reported an operating income of Rs 294.7 cr in FY20 from Rs 10.09 cr a year ago.An email sent to Actis did not elicit any response till the press time. \u201cAs a part of the company\u2019s business growth strategy, we continue to evaluate various viable options. The company, however, doesn\u2019t comment on speculations,  said an Adani Green spokesperson, while spokespersons with Brookfield and CPPIB declined comment.Sprng Energy will continue to benefit from the demonstrated operating track record as well as the presence of long-term PPAs at cost competitive tariffs with strong counterparties for a major portion of the company\u2019s portfolio on a consolidated basis, rating agency ICRA said in a note in June.Going forward, the group\u2019s ability to commission the under-construction projects in a timely manner and within budgeted costs while achieving healthy PLF levels for its operational projects would be important from the credit perspective, ICRA said.The interest from global investors in India\u2019s green energy space has been high in the last couple of years, despite a slowdown in RE capacity addition in FY21. RE capacity addition went down to 7.4 GW in FY21 from 8.7 GW in FY20 amid the execution headwinds due to Covid-19.India has attracted investments to the tune of Rs 1.32 lakh crore in the renewable energy sector in the past three years since 2017. At present, India\u2019s installed renewable energy capacity is about 95 GW including 40.5 GW of solar power.The target of 175 gigawatts (GW) of installed renewable energy capacity will likely be achieved in fiscal year 26 alone, compared to the target of reaching it by December 2022, ICRA said.The RE sector is expected to see investments of Rs 3.5 trillion over the next four years, increasing the share of RE capacity to 34 per cent of the overall installed capacity by March 2025 from 25 per cent as of March 2021 led by the solar power segment.\u201cA lot of consolidation is likely to happen in the sector as there is overwhelming interest from strategic as well as financial investors into India\u2019s renewable space. Some of those investors are long term players. We have seen massive investment inflow towards this sector during the last 5-7 years and the trend is likely to continue in the near-term,\u201d said Pankaj Bisht, managing partner at Connesso Consulting LLP, a boutique management consulting firm in Delhi.Multiple other factors are responsible for large scale consolidation, industry observers said. One of the major reasons is land acquisition for greenfield projects, heightened environmental scrutiny, especially to evacuate power through over ground transmission lines in key states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, clearances from different government departments like PGCIL and state electricity boards. States have also reneged on signed power purchase agreements and recent auctions have seen record low tariffs making financial viability of several projects questionable. \u201cThis has significantly impacted the smaller players and also the larger players who had high interest costs,\u201d said Bisht.",

        "articleBody": "China's Sinopec Corp plans to spend 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) on hydrogen energy by 2025 as the state oil and gas major pivots to producing natural gas and hydrogen as part of becoming a carbon-neutral energy provider by 2050.Asia's biggest oil refiner said on Monday it plans to become China's largest company to produce hydrogen for use as a transportation fuel, targeting annual capacity of 200,000 tonnes of hydrogen refuelling by 2025. Sinopec will expand forcefully into making hydrogen from renewable energy, and zero in on hydrogen for transportation fuel and using green hydrogen for refining,  acting Chairman Ma Yongsheng said.The company aims to produce more than 1 million tonnes of so-called green hydrogen from renewable energy sources between 2021 and 2025, as well as add 400 megawatts of solar power generation capacity for supplying electricity to charge vehicles.Sinopec has so far built 20 hydrogen filling stations, with another 60 under construction or in the planning and approval stage.The company produces about 3 million tonnes per year of hydrogen from non-renewable energy sources that is mainly used in oil refinery and petrochemical processes.The company on Sunday reported its highest first-half net profit since 2018, at $6.05 billion, on rebounding oil and gas prices as well as steady domestic fuel demand.China's natural gas consumption is expected to rise 13.3% in 2021 amid a strong economic recovery and Beijing's push to replace coal with lower-carbon gas, Ma said. That level of growth should continue over the next three years.Like state-run peers PetroChina and CNOOC Ltd that are prioritising natural gas development over oil, Sinopec plans to boost gas output in the second half of 2021 by 13.5% from a year earlier, compared with 13.7% growth in the first six months.Sinopec maximized its refinery operations in the first half, pushing throughput to 126.11 million tonnes of oil, or about 5.1 million barrels per day, up 13.7% from a year earlier when demand was curtailed by the outbreak of COVID-19.Domestic fuel sales in the period rose by 8.1% on strong demand for gasoline and other light fuels such as naphtha used as petrochemical feedstocks.Refinery throughput in the second half of the year is forecast to be flat to the first-half and year-earlier periods, remaining at about 126 million tonnes.Its trading arm Unipec posted a profit of 3.5 billion yuan during the period, the firm said, without giving a comparison.Amid Beijing's broad policy to limit China's refined fuel exports, Sinopec's first-half fuel exports fell 10% from a year earlier to about 9 million tonnes.",

        "articleBody": "Delhi Power Minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday inaugurated a 10 MW battery energy storage system here which he claimed to be the largest in South Asia that will be used for electricity load management across the capital. The system will prevent power cuts and fluctuations, and can be charged through renewable sources of energy as well, the Delhi government said.  Visited 10MW Battery Energy Storage System at Rohini today (Sunday). This system is made by Tata Power and is South Asia's largest Energy Storage System.  This will be used in grid stabilization and load management across Delhi and will also make use of renewable energy sources,  Jain said in a tweet. Later the government released a statement, saying the energy storage system of 10 MW is the  biggest and first of its kind  not only in India but in entire South Asia.  The battery bank will store power amid off-peak demand which then can be utilised during peak demand hours, thereby stabilising the whole grid.  The system will prevent power cuts and fluctuations, and the energy storage system can be charged through renewable sources of energy as well,  the statement quoting Jain said. According to real-time data of Delhi State Load Dispatch Centre, this year's the peak power demand had reached 7,323 MW at 3.16 pm on July 2. Jain further said the Arvind Kejriwal government's people-oriented governance model that rests on innovative public policies is exemplary and fit to be replicated all over the country.  Our vision is to create a network of such power banks around Delhi worth 600 MW which will ensure that consumers don't get affected at all due to grid fluctuations,  Jain said. The power minister further directed officials to make this energy storage system even more efficient and effective.  This facility costs around Rs 55 crores but we are looking to reduce costs by innovating it further. We will review the project in a month's time and based on our learnings from its operation, we will plan out the replication of the system for other parts of the city,  Jain said in the statement.",

Union Minister R K Singh has informed Mr Kerry about India's plan to emerge as a global leader in green hydrogen. India is proposing to mandate using green hydrogen in fertilizer and in refining. This is part of the government's commitment towards replacing grey hydrogen with green hydrogen,  the statement said.Singh underlined to the US Presidential envoy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi places the highest importance on the environment.He suggested to him that India and the USA could work together in the areas of innovations for power and technology, pointing out the requirement of bringing down the cost of storage of renewable power.The minister informed Kerry about the recent milestone the country had achieved by crossing 100 GW in Installed solar and wind capacity. If we add Hydro capacity also, the total installed renewable capacity is 147 GW. Further, 63 GW of renewable capacity is under construction which makes India one of the fastest growing in terms of renewable capacity addition,  it stated.Singh also informed Kerry that the National Hydrogen Energy Mission has been launched to enable cost competitive green hydrogen production. He added that India would be conducting competitive bids for green hydrogen in the next 3-4 months to pave the road for viable usage of hydrogen as a fuel.The other countries need to come up with more electrolyser plants to bring down the costs.It was suggested that India and the USA should work at setting up an alternate supply chain for lithium in order to secure input material for battery energy storage.",

        "articleBody": "Along the Arabian Sea, the Indian city of Jamnagar is a money-making machine for Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, processing crude oil into fuel, plastics and chemicals. It\u2019s also where the billionaire is making his newest bet: a $10 billion investment in green energy.In a swath of arid land, to the city\u2019s southwest, Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd., owns the world\u2019s biggest oil refining complex. It\u2019s a sprawling network of plants and pipelines that can process 1.4 million barrels of petroleum a day in an operation covering half the area of Manhattan. In fiscal 2021, Reliance generated about 45 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions from its own operations, which puts the company among the top such emitters in India, according to data on other companies tracked by Bloomberg. Much of that came from its Jamnagar refineries. Next door, in a nod to a changing \u2014 and warming \u2014 world Ambani is now building factories that make more environmentally friendly products like solar panels, electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries.On the face of it, the new investment is a sharp pivot for a giant conglomerate whose fortunes have been linked to oil refining for decades. Yet even as Ambani, 64, touts the shift to less polluting options, crude\u2019s byproducts will remain one of the biggest drivers of the $80 billion fortune that\u2019s made him the world\u2019s 12th richest man.Reliance gets nearly 60% of its $73 billion in annual revenue from its oil-related business, which is so lucrative that it\u2019s attracting other investors. The Middle Eastern energy firm Saudi Aramco is in discussions for the purchase of a roughly 20% stake in Reliance\u2019s refining and chemicals business. Ambani\u2019s conglomerate is also investing in global expansion projects for the petrochemicals business that\u2019ll last for decades. Even if its new energy operations take off, they will contribute only 10% of Reliance\u2019s total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by fiscal 2026, while oil-to-chemicals will stay at about 33%, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts estimated in July.      85644299 That\u2019s making Jamnagar a location that highlights a broader tension in the energy transition: While the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel companies are rushing to placate investors \u2014 and chase profits \u2014 by adding clean power sources, that doesn\u2019t signal a quick retreat from polluting fuels. It\u2019s a contrast playing out even as climate scientists escalate warnings about the fallouts of human-caused global warming.M.V. Ramana, an energy policy scholar and professor at University of British Columbia, said it would be hard for Reliance to dissociate from fossil fuel businesses that create emissions. \u201cIf you look at what Reliance\u2019s trajectory has been, it is one of expansion of its fossil fuels business,\u201d Ramana said. Shifting dramatically away from the more polluting oil-to-chemicals business is difficult \u201cbecause it is going to affect their bottomline,\u201d he said. Reliance didn't respond to requests for comment. At its annual shareholders' meeting in June, Ambani acknowledged the need for change. \u201cThe age of fossil fuels, which powered economic growth globally for nearly three centuries, cannot continue much longer. The huge quantities of carbon it has emitted into the environment have endangered life on earth,'' he said. Reliance has said it will make its operations carbon neutral by 2035 with the help of projects that offset emissions.There are also plans to arm the 7,500-acre Jamnagar refinery-and-petrochemicals complex with solar power, green hydrogen and carbon dioxide capture and usage technologies. To curb pollution, about 2,200 acres of land within the facility have been converted into a green pasture, growing mangoes, guavas and medicinal plants.The site\u2019s scope is so vast that it\u2019s rubbed off on the city\u2019s economy. The facility stands near miles of salt pans, its stacks towering over the low-rise houses in surrounding villages. Reliance\u2019s logo is seen at the airport, on the numerous gas stations it operates, malls and the banners of its telephone service Jio. Jamnagar now has multi-storeyed apartments and luxury cars running on its roads. The Ambani firm has over the last 10 years invested about $15 billion to boost profits from its legacy oil refining and petrochemicals businesses, including $4 billion to convert petroleum coke \u2014 one of the dirtiest refinery by-products \u2014 into gas needed to power the massive Jamnagar complex. It\u2019s also said it will spend $6 billion ramping up natural gas production from the depths of the sea along with joint venture partner BP Plc. In addition, the Reliance-BP joint venture is adding more fuel stations. BP didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Reliance\u2019s Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 those caused directly by a company\u2019s operations \u2014 surged 60% in the year ended March 2020 to 47.5 million tons, mainly because it started using petcoke produced from the refineries internally, instead of selling it to customers outside, according to the company\u2019s latest annual report. A year later, emissions came down to 45 million tons.India is one of the world\u2019s biggest consumers of oil, and demand is only rising as its middle class buys more vehicles, and consumes more products like plastic bottles and paint that are made from petrochemicals. Many Indian cities, including capital New Delhi, are among the world\u2019s most polluted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched a national clean air program. The new Reliance green venture will be spread over 5,000 acres of land. Ambani has said a key focus will be to create products for producing solar power, an area where India has long lagged China. \u201cWhen companies of this size announce such ambitious plans, it gives a great fillip to the decarbonization goals of the nations and the world at large,\u201d said Shantanu Jaiswal, head of India at BloombergNEF. Still, moving away from polluting fossil fuels for economic reasons is hard not just for Reliance, but for the nation as a whole. India has insisted that developed nations take larger initial steps to cut emissions so that poorer nations don\u2019t feel the economic strain.The Jamnagar refinery has spawned a whole generation of entrepreneurs. \u201cThe billions of dollars Reliance has invested has significantly boosted the local economy,\u201d said Chandrsinh Ramsinh Jadeja, 52, who developed a business doing construction work for Reliance in Jamnagar. \u201cFarmers earned money, sent their kids to school and purchased land elsewhere, tens of thousands of jobs were created.\u201d Reliance earned a net profit of 537.4 billion rupees ($7.2 billion) in the year ended March, the most by any Indian company. Ambani has in recent years expanded into retail and built his digital business with investments from big names like Facebook Inc. The mammoth Aramco deal under discussion showed how important the oil-to-chemicals enterprise remains to his future. In 2019, Ambani estimated that such a deal would lock in about half-a-million barrels a day of Saudi crude for processing at Reliance\u2019s refineries. The latest news about the deal boosted the company\u2019s shares by as much as 2.7% and Ambani\u2019s net worth by more than $1 billion.\u201cReliance\u2019s diversification into green energy is a starting point, it\u2019s a welcome shift. But the business is evolving,\u201d said Kanika Chawla, program manager for UN-Energy, which leads inter-agency collaboration on sustainable energy. \u201cIt\u2019s not a change in regime.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Mukesh Ambani has enlisted eight global technocrats, many of whom are advisers to governments, as part of a nine-member New Energy Council to enable Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) to pivot from its traditional oil-to-gas business into a green energy giant. The council will be headed by R Mashelkar, national research professor and independent director at RIL. It will include Alan Finkel, who led Australia\u2019s National Hydrogen Strategy and is a special adviser to that country\u2019s government on low emissions technologies; Rachid Yazami, a winner of the Draper Prize for engineering; Robert Armstrong, director of MIT\u2019s energy initiative; and Martin Green, known among his peers as the \u2018father of photovoltaics\u2019 for having revolutionised the efficiency and cost of solar cells.The others on the council are David Milstein, known for breakthrough research in splitting water to get hydrogen, innovative energy storage systems and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS); Geoffrey Maitland, a professor of energy engineering at Imperial College, London, a global authority on carbon capture and storage technologies; and Henrik Stiesdal, a pioneer of the modern wind industry, with more than 175 inventions to his credit. Ambani will also be a member.\u201cMembers of the council include not only the visionary behind the plan, Mukesh Ambani himself, but also authorities and leaders of global stature in solar, wind, CCUS, policy, and green technologies,\u201d Mashelkar told ET. \u201cThey will be vital in not only leading an accelerated transition of India to clean energy but also in impacting global energy needs and markets.\u201dThe council\u2019s task will be to validate RIL\u2019s plans for a focused technology roadmap to build a system for making clean and affordable energy in a span of five to 15 years. The panel will guide on technical strategy, help identify opportunities and advise on partnerships worldwide.      85637572\u201cMukesh Ambani\u2019s vision is well structured, bold, well-funded, and far-reaching,\u201d said Finkel. \u201cIt is the product of deep planning and extreme commitment to Indian and global sustainability. It is national in scope, but offers far more clarity than most nations have been able to articulate.\u201dReliance plans to spend \u20b960,000 crore to construct four Giga factories to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolysers, fuel cells, and batteries to store energy from the grid. These plants will be located at the new 5,000-acre Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar. An additional \u20b915,000 crore will be used for investments across the value chain, technology, and partnerships for the new energy business. Ultimately, Reliance plans to offer a fully integrated end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to customers through solar, batteries, and hydrogen.\u201cReliance has often co-opted accomplished global thought leaders and achievers as advisors in its growth journey,\u201d a company spokesperson told ET.RIL has among the world\u2019s biggest petrochemical and refinery complexes at Jamnagar and has more recently built national scale businesses in telecom and retail. Over the past year or so, it has got more than $20 billion from Google, Facebook and bulge-bracket investors for stakes in these arms.Ambani, 64, is known to seek the company of academicians, inventors, and thought leaders to absorb and validate ideas before embarking on any major project.\u201cReliance\u2019 strategy is analogous to the \u2018pick shovels over mines\u2019 approach,\u201d foreign brokerage Bernstein said in a July 15 report.

        "articleBody": "The country\u2019s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, will not enter electric vehicles in the short term and will enter \u201conly when it is feasible\u201d to sell reasonable numbers, chairman R C Bhargava told shareholders at the company\u2019s 40th annual general meeting.Bhargava said the government's focus is on the electrification of two-wheelers at present, where companies like Hero Electric and Ola have been focusing on product interventions. In the passenger vehicles segment, a few manufacturers have brought EVs,  but the sales volume is minimal, and it has had no impact on the market share of Maruti Suzuki,  Bhargava said.This comment comes when homegrown vehicle makers Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have lined up over a dozen pure battery electric vehicles for the Indian market until 2025.In response to queries from several shareholders, Bhargava said Maruti Suzuki is looking at the electric vehicle (EV) segment without making a loss on operations. \u201cMaruti Suzuki is the leader in the passenger vehicle industry, and it fully intends to have leadership in EVs. But it is important to understand EV penetration will only happen in India when conditions become such that consumers can buy it,\u201d he said.To be sure, Maruti Suzuki\u2019s focus in the short term is CNG and hybrid vehicles \u2013 until the time EVs reach a certain scale. On its part, the company\u2019s sister arm \u2013 Suzuki - and Denso and Toshiba, have already started working on localization of lithium-ion cells and engaging with the vendor fraternity to have a deeper localization to deliver an EV \u201cthat is accessible and delivers enough scale to add to the bottom line.\u201dSuzuki\u2019s parent company had said an India specific EV might be ready by 2025.Regarding issues related to climate change, zero-emission and carbon neutrality, India has to follow its own schedule and not be pressured by the timelines set by more developed nations in the world, the chairman asserted.\u201cYes, we must work with the rest of the world, we must be concerned about climate change, we must go on to reduce emissions. But we and the world have both to recognise the disparities in income and living styles and the disparity in the consumption of energy per capita in the developed world and India,  he added.The company will be launching an all-new sports utility vehicle next year to expand its footprint in the fast-growing segment in the mainstream market.The development work on the vehicle is underway, which will be introduced shortly. \u201cOnce we have the SUV next year, we will have more market share in that area\u201d, he added.While Maruti Suzuki dominates the utility vehicle segment in the local market with the Vitara Brezza, Ertiga, XL6 and S-Cross, Korean rival Hyundai has made rapid strides in the SUV category with best-sellers Venue, Creta and most recently the Alcazar.Separately, Bhargava said while Maruti Suzuki has faced some loss in production due to the shortage in availability of semiconductors, it is not of major concern. The current shortage of semiconductors facing the automobile industry is temporary, partly caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and is expected to be over by 2022.  Meanwhile, there has been a bit of a hit on the production of vehicles, and we have had to adjust, but there is no major loss that we have to be concerned about,  Bhargava said.According to him, if India at all is going to be able to give to a bulk of its citizens a decent and respectable lifestyle, if it is to catch up and reduce the gap between the living standard with the rest of the developed world,  it will require a much higher per capita energy consumption even if we adopt much more energy-efficient means on consumption . Bhargava further said:  And to do that we cannot follow everything which the West does. We have to make our own schedules and programmes and ensure that we do not adopt rules and regulations, which results in the people of India not being able ever to come up to the point of levels which they need to come up with to reduce (the gap) with the rest of the world. Bhargava also said Maruti Suzuki India had outlined a capex of Rs 4,500 crore in the ongoing fiscal, but the company will know the actual spend by the end of the year.",

        "articleBody": "Renewable energy startup Ohmium International on Tuesday announced the start of India's first green hydrogen electrolyzer gigafactory that will turn power from renewable sources into carbon-free hydrogen. The Bengaluru plant will have an initial manufacturing capacity of 500 MW per year, with plans to scale to 2 GW (2000 MW), the firm said in a statement.   While a number of corporates have announced plans to produce green hydrogen, the manufacture of electrolyzer by Ohmium will ensure availability of end-to-end solution within the country and cut down dependence on imports for this key equipment,  it said.  Green Hydrogen, which is the pollution-free fuel of the future, is industry agnostic and will facilitate India's transition to clean energy.  With zero carbon footprint, the green hydrogen can be utilized for fertilizer production, refinery processing, steel production, conventional vehicle transportation with methanol blending, and direct hydrogen transportation in fuel-cell-based vehicles. Green Hydrogen can also be stored and transported.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in his Independence Day speech announced the setting up of the National Hydrogen Mission with the aim of becoming the new global hub of green hydrogen, and also its largest exporter.   We are excited by the Prime Minister's announcement and fully support India's transition to a clean, safe and secure energy future.

Bansal also confirmed that Morgan Stanley had engaged Citibank to find a buyer for its stake.North Haven Infrastructure Partners, a global infrastructure fund managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, invested $212 million in Continuum Energy in 2012. Continuum Energy has a portfolio of 3.5 GW comprising 807.4 MW operational capacity, 502.5 MW under-construction, 950 MW ready-for-construction sites and an additional 1,300 MW under development. It owns and operates India\u2019s largest, 226.8 MW wind-solar co-located hybrid project in Tamil Nadu and is in the process of building a similar 250 MW wind-solar hybrid project in Gujarat.     85575609The company\u2019s renewable energy portfolio is similar in size to that of Tata Power\u2019s.In 2015, US-based Sun Edison, the world\u2019s largest renewable energy company at the time, had struck a deal to buy Continuum Energy but the deal was terminated because of Sun Edison\u2019s financial troubles. Sun Edison eventually filed for bankruptcy in the US.Norway\u2019s Statkraft held discussions to acquire Continuum Energy in 2019, but a deal did not materialise. Recently, reports surfaced about ReNew Power\u2019s interest in acquiring the company. But Bansal said the reports were not true. Continuum Energy raised $561 million in February this year by selling bonds to international investors. In April, the company obtained financing of $120 million from 3 investors \u2014 Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and Pierfront Capital.  ",

Azure won another 300 MW at Rs 2.35, according to the results accessed by ET.Renewable energy developers have to take into account the basic customs duty (BCD) for all bids henceforth, which was expected to yield tariffs of 2.40 and above, according to developers ET spoke to.Other competing bids by ReNew Power, Hero Future Energies, Adani Green, and AMP Energy, Avaada, Torrent, and Tata Power fell short of the winning bids. These companies were anticipating higher borrowing costs and a hike in import prices of solar equipment due to the basic customs duty (BCD). To us, these tariffs seem unsustainable. We're really interested to see how the winning bids are commissioned,  an executive from a competing developer told ET.SECI had tendered the hybrid project's bid in April earlier this year.

        "articleBody": "India's top gas company GAIL will foray into hydrogen generation and take the acquisition route to scale up its renewable energy portfolio as it pivots business beyond natural gas to align with energy transition being witnessed across the globe.As part of a push to embrace cleaner forms of energy, GAIL will be laying pipeline infrastructure to connect consumption centres to gas sources while also augmenting its renewable energy portfolio, GAIL Chairman and Managing Director Manoj Jain said. The global energy sector is witnessing a paradigm shift in recent years as the world is transitioning to a sustainable energy future,  he said in the company's latest annual report.To accomplish a cleaner primary energy mix for India, the government is emphasizing the expansion of the natural gas sector so as to achieve a gas-based economy along with growth in renewables. GAIL as a leading integrated energy major has aligned with this vision, he said.The firm is laying around 6,000-kilometres of pipeline, including a west coast to east coast pipeline from Mumbai to Jharsuduga in Odisha via Nagpur, he said. It currently has around 13,700-km of natural gas pipeline network.GAIL  will be selectively investing in the renewable energy domain given the future growth potential,  he said. The company  has been scouting for opportunities to scale up the RE portfolio from the current 130 MW through bidding and other inorganic routes such as mergers and acquisitions.  In addition, the company is also foraying into ethanol and hydrogen generation,  he said without giving details.Hydrogen is a clean fuel that, when consumed in a fuel cell, produces only water. Many countries are venturing into hydrogen production from a variety of domestic resources, such as natural gas, nuclear power, biomass, and renewable power like solar and wind.In India, companies ranging from Reliance Industries to Indian Oil Corporation and NTPC have announced ambitious plans for generating hydrogen. GAIL too joins that list now.GAIL, Jain said, has the largest and most diverse LNG portfolio in India that can offer both stable prices and reliable supply to consumers.The company  shall be pushing for higher gas usage in the industrial segment, transport segment using CNG and LNG, Trigeneration, cold storage, etc,  he said, adding the firm was looking for avenues to supply gas in the new segments like LNG trucking (LNG for long-haul transportation).He said GAIL is also looking to expand its presence in petrochemicals and also diversifying into high-margin downstream businesses. The focus is on having polypropylene (PP) production capacity through setting up two polypropylene units (Propane Dehydrogenation Polypropylene Plant - PDHPP in Usar, Maharashtra and PP plant at Pata, Uttar Pradesh) and assessing opportunities in certain speciality chemicals in India,  he said.GAIL presently has a 1.6 million tonnes per annum polyethylene and PP production capacity. It is also setting up at least two compressed biogas plants and an ethanol factory.India, which imports 85 per cent of its crude oil needs, is stepping up efforts to explore new forms of energy to clean up the skies and reduce dependence on imported fuels. We have 120 MW of renewable energy capacity which we want to scale up to 1GW in next 3-4 years,  Jain had told PTI last month.GAIL will bid for a 400 MW solar power capacity being auctioned by SECI (formerly Solar Energy Corporation of India) in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.The company had in 2019 won a bid for 874 MW operational wind power projects of IL&FS for Rs 4,800 crore. But IL&FS' other partners used the first right of refusal to block GAIL's bid, he had said.GAIL has signed up with state-run power gear maker BHEL for its renewable energy foray. The tie-up looks to leverage the competitive strengths of both companies. GAIL will be the project developer and BHEL will be a project manager and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor.The move by GAIL, which commands a 75 per cent market share in gas transmission and more than 50 per cent share in gas trading in India, is seen as part of the government's vision to prepare for the energy transition process, under which the share of gas in the energy mix is sought to be raised to 15 per cent by 2030, from the current 6.2 per cent.

        "articleBody": "India has made remarkable strides to ensure universal access to electricity for every household, even as it is moving on a reforms agenda for affordable and sustainable energy systems. The success of energy policy and implementation is gauged along the touchstones of availability, access and sustainability. This has demonstrated lessons for global energy transitions and climate actions.Since 2014, India has added 182 GW of generation capacity, the bulk of which is in renewables. It exports 8,000 million units of power annually to Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh. It has also added 142,000 circuit km of transmission lines, connecting the entire country to a single grid with one national control centre. These steps have enabled the increase of interregional transfer capacity to more than 100,000 MW.A national market has emerged, with generators now able to sell power to any discom, ensuring open access to consumers. The MERIT (Merit order despatch of Electricity for Rejuvenation of Income and Transparency) system links 132 generating units with installed capacity of 55,940 MW, leading to savings and efficiencies.According to the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), an average Indian household received 20.6 hours of power supply from the grid in 2020. Today, the average daily supply in urban and rural areas is 23.36 and 22.5 hours of power supply respectively.Universal household electricity access was a central political commitment in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, and the government placed a high priority on following it through. On August 15, 2015, Narendra Modi had announced a target of connecting every village with electricity within 1,000 days. It is to the credit of the power ministry that the stiff target was achieved in time, including for villages in the Himalayan belt and the deserts of Rajasthan.This was followed by the launch of the Saubhagya programme aimed at bringing electric power to every home in India. Over 28 million houses were given access to electricity in just 18 months. The universalisation of access to electricity was also done with an aim of eliminating the dependence of households on traditional fuels such as kerosene for lighting and cooking, and firewood and cow dung cakes for cooking.Ensuring more efficient use of grid resources, till date, over 25.23 lakh smart meters have been installed across states, and about 81 lakh smart meters are under deployment.Connecting India with an integrated grid has led to the emergence of a national electricity market, with discoms able to buy power from any generation company across the country. There are now two national exchanges, with intra day-ahead and term-ahead markets, and a separate green term-ahead market.Energy transition has also kept abreast at a remarkable pace, with renewables capacity increasing by over three times in the last seven years. Pursuing consistent and transparent procurement methods, India has emerged as an attractive destination for investment in renewables, attracting more than $42 billion in the last six years.With the universalisation of power, a significant reduction in kerosene consumption by households was recorded \u2014 from 8,920 million litres in 2014-15 to 2,040 million litres in 2020-21. This 77% reduction in kerosene consumption, in turn, led to a reduction in CO2 emissions by 17.2 million tonnes a year. Additionally, India had distributed billions of LEDs (light-emitting diodes) by July 2021, reducing CO2 emissions by 171 million tonnes a year. This measure has made electricity consumers equal partners in India\u2019s energy transition journey.The PM-KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan) scheme launched in March 2019 provides energy security to farmers, with a target of solarising 35 lakh diesel and grid-connected agriculture pumps. Based on the demand, 3.59 lakh standalone solar pumps, solarisation of 76,000 individual grid-connected pumps, and feeder-level solarisation of over 9.25 lakh grid-connected pumps have been sanctioned under this scheme.The next big push can come on achieving the ambitious target of 40 GW capacity from rooftop solar by 2022. Financial benefits to companies that switch entirely to renewable power, battery storage systems, connection portability, effective monitoring operations, active expansion of corrective measures like the smart metering systems and other AI-supported advancements, all with a consumer-centric approach, will further improve the reliability of power supply across the country.The current power sector transformation around energy availability, access and sustainability places India as a global leader in climate action and transition to clean energy. India\u2019s power sector story, and its ensuing energy transitions, present a real-time case study of actions that can be replicated in other geographies.",

        "articleBody": "After a tepid FY21 for investments in the Indian renewable energy sector, the first quarter of FY22 is back on track with funding of $6.6 billion, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said.Between April and July, the investment in the sector has already surpassed $6.4 billion. The ongoing fiscal year is also on track to  easily  exceed the $8.4 billion of FY20, IEEFA added.\u201cRebounding energy demand and a surge of commitments from banks and financial institutions to exit fossil fuel financing are helping to drive investment into Indian renewable energy infrastructure,\u201d says author Vibhuti Garg, energy economist and India lead at IEEFA.Adani Green's acquisition of Softbank's SB Energy for a total value of $3.5 billion in May ranked as the biggest deal of the quarter. Other major deals included ACME Solar, ReNew Power, Azure Power, and Avaada.Green bonds issued by Indian companies such as ReNew, Azure, and ACME are also attracting huge investments, and are expected to grow in size.The first two weeks of August got off to a strong start too, with deals involving CleanMax and ReNew crossing $600 million already. Including the $414 million bond by Azure, this month alone has crossed $1 billion.In an earlier report, IEEFA had outlined that India will need at least a $500 billion of investment in the Indian renewable energy industry to meet the 450 GW target that the Centre wants to achieve. $300 billion of that would be used for wind and solar infrastructure, $50 billion for grid firming investments, and $150 billionn on expanding and modernising India's transmission infrastructure.",

        "articleBody": "Two thirds of the global economy, including several major Asian coal users, including Japan, South Korea and China, have announced net zero ambitions which will require material declines in the use of fossil fuels, especially coal. However, India has yet to commit to a net zero target. According to data from Global Energy Monitor (GEM), since 2010 India has cancelled or retired 590 GW of coal plants. Nevertheless, India has a coal power plant pipeline of almost 60 GW, which represents 15% of the global development pipeline.This is uneconomic and risks shouldering Indian consumers and taxpayers with much of the financial and environmental burden further down the line by linking the grid into higher cost thermal energy and potentially leaving a swathe of unprofitable coal plants to become stranded assets.Carbon Tracker analysis shows that 86% of these new coal power projects will generate a negative value of almost --$40 billion even assuming generous business-as-usual (BAU) timeframes. This rises to 93% and -$54 billion when considering a more climate-constrained scenario, which will see coal plant closures at the latest by 2040 and much earlier than the 40 years many developers assume at project inception. NTPC and Adani Power are particularly exposed to value destruction with an estimated -$16 bn and -$2.4bn at risk, respectively under BAU, based on Carbon Tracker\u2019s scenario modelling in its June 2021 report, \u2018Do Not Revive Coal\u2019.Indeed, the fragility of coal economics is highlighted by relatively minor changes to the cost of debt: for every 1% higher debt costs, negative value increases by $3 billion for this project pipeline. Given coal financing is becoming scarce, higher debt costs are not an unreasonable assumption.Capacity (or load) factors of coal plants have been on a declining trend globally, and India is no exception. Carbon Tracker estimates that since 2018, capacity factors for coal plants have on average fallen by 5% across India, with overall coal fleet utilisation at 53% in 2020. Load factors are a key marker of plant profitability -- the less a plant generates, the lower revenues and profits it makes. This is particularly bad for India\u2019s coal fleet which has an average capacity-weighted age of 17 years compared to an expected useful life of 40 years. It is even worse for new coal plants which will have to contend with lower utilisation for longer and run the risk of becoming stranded assets.It is now cheaper to build new renewable energy (RE) in India than it is to build new coal plants. Building new renewables already outcompetes 84% of the operating coal fleet in India. By 2024, renewables will outcompete existing coal in all parts of India. Carbon Tracker estimates that to develop new onshore wind costs $40/MWh and for new solar photovoltaics $37/MWh. This compares favourably to existing coal plants, which have an estimated cost of $41/MWh.The deflationary trend already seen in renewable costs is set to see further declines this decade thanks to scale efficiencies, unlike for coal plants which are heavily exposed to volatile fuel costs. Moreover, delays by coal plant operators in implementing emissions reduction technology, designed to improve India\u2019s poor air quality, will see an initial rise in running costs for plants from 2025 when these are widely expected to be applied. This could account for an increase of up to 13% in costs.Of the total 60 GW pipeline, 23 GW is in the permit or pre-permit stage, which may mean that financing has yet to be secured. Well over half of this amount originates with state-linked companies. The risks and opportunities are clearly framed in terms of financial and environmental outcomes, and it is not too late for India to reset on the right path for a sustainable energy future.India should stop building new coal plants and should instead focus on renewables development and remove obstacles to clean energy growth. Last year, India announced a target build out of 450 GW of renewables by 2030, which will equate to 60% of energy from renewables. This compares to around 80 GW total capacity from wind and solar in 2020, which saw net additions of only 5 GW from 2019.Renewables growth has been slow owing to various challenges, including offtaker risk, a lack of infrastructure and a dearth of financing for new projects. There is some evidence that things are changing at the margin with State Bank of India providing financing of around $4 billion to renewable projects, as well as announcements by private sector companies like Reliance Industries, which will invest $10 billion in clean energy over the next three years.GoI should promote investment in clean energy sources. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, India has committed more money to the energy sector than any other major economy. However, of the $136 billion of funds committed more than half is directed to \u2018other\u2019 energy, which could find its way to fossil fuel financing, compared to $36 billion earmarked for clean energy.India should take this opportunity to direct more financing to clean energy and away from fossil fuels that contribute to making India\u2019s air the most polluted globally. This will better prepare the country for a sustainable grid, will enable an orderly coal phase out, and will be a lower cost alternative for consumers and tax payers than continuing to subsidise fossil fuels.The writer is founder, Carbon Tracker Initiative",

        "articleBody": "From firms run by billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani to state-owned oil refiner IndianOil and electricity producer NTPC, Indian firms have announced ambitious plans to embrace hydrogen as fuel as the nation transitions towards carbon-free fuel.  Hydrogen is the latest buzz for meeting the world's energy needs. Being the cleanest form of energy, it can be produced from a variety of resources, such as natural gas, biomass, and renewable power like solar and wind. It can be used in cars, in houses, for portable power and in many more applications.  No doubt, it is gaining currency in India like other places in the world.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced a National Hydrogen Mission.   Green Hydrogen is the future of the world. Today, I announce the setting up of the National Hydrogen Mission with the aim of becoming the new global hub of Green Hydrogen, and also its largest exporter,  he said in his Independence Day address.  The Mission was first announced in this year's Union Budget in February and companies have since then queued up to announce projects. But neither that announcement nor Modi's speech on Sunday defined production or capacity targets.  Besides the transport sector, hydrogen can find its use in a range of sectors such as chemicals, iron and steel, heating and power.  Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd, recently announced hydrogen plans as part of the biggest private refiner's move to become a net carbon-zero firm by 2035.   While Reliance will remain a user of crude oil and natural gas, we are committed to embracing new technologies to convert our CO into useful products and chemicals,  he had told shareholders on June 24.   Reliance also has proprietary technology to convert transportation fuels to valuable petrochemical and material building blocks. And at the same time, we will replace transportation fuels with clean electricity and hydrogen,  Ambani had said.  In March, Adani Group had announced a partnership with Maire Tecnimont to develop green hydrogen projects in India.  Indian Oil Corp (IOC), which controls about a third of India's 250 million tonnes of oil refining capacity, plans to build a green hydrogen plant at its Mathura refinery in Uttar Pradesh.   IndianOil has a wind power project in Rajasthan. We intend to wheel that power to our Mathura refinery to produce absolutely green hydrogen through electrolysis,  IOC Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said last month.  Green hydrogen, derived from water electrolysis using renewable energy such as solar or wind, will replace carbon-emitting fuels used in the refinery to process crude oil into value-added products, such as petrol and diesel.  NTPC, the nation's largest electricity generator, has also announced plans to set up India's first green hydrogen fuelling station in Leh, Ladakh.  NTPC is looking to set up a pilot project for blending hydrogen with national gas for use in city gas distribution.  In a tweet, ACME Group said it  has taken the 1st step to set up world's first green hydrogen and ammonia plant in Rajasthan.    Clean electricity is the future! India stands 5th globally in installed solar capacity. Renewable sources contribute 1/4th of the capacity here,  it said.  Hydrogen is produced predominantly through Steam Methane Reforming, or SMR, which utilises fossils fuels, such as natural gas or coal, and through Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using a current of electricity.  Currently, all hydrogen consumed in India comes from fossil fuels. By 2050, three-fourth of all hydrogen is projected to be green -- produced by renewable electricity and electrolysis.  IOC is also working on technology to develop hydrogen-spiked compressed natural gas, or H-CNG. This H-CNG will be used to run buses.  However, hydrogen production currently is expensive when compared with alternatives. Also supply and distribution is a challenge.  Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who as the minister for petroleum and natural gas had taken initiatives to push for building hydrogen infrastructure, on Sunday said he welcomed the announcement for a National Hydrogen Mission.   A clear cut roadmap for energy transition involving a gas-based economy, network of CNG & PNG across the country, 20% ethanol blending will help realise the goal of becoming energy independent when India turns 100,  Pradhan, who is now the HRD Minister, tweeted.  The current oil minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, said,  On this historic occasion PM Modi Ji has announced the National Hydrogen Mission which aims to make India a green hydrogen production & export hub & will give rise to green jobs. He shared his vision to make India energy independent before completing 100 years of independence.   At present, oil refineries are the largest producer of hydrogen, which is used in various processes of refining crude oil.  The government plans to make it mandatory for refineries and fertiliser plants to use some green hydrogen.  Hydrogen also helps India meets its climate commitment.  In the past six years, India has increased its renewable power portfolio from 32 gigawatts to almost 100 GW and is on track to achieve the target of 450 GW of renewable energy generating capacity by 2030.",

        "articleBody": "State-run NTPC has invited global 'expression of interest' to set up a pilot project on hydrogen blending with natural gas in city gas distribution. The expression of interest (EoI) follows the recent tenders floated by NTPC REL for green hydrogen fuelling station at Leh and NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) for procurement of Fuel Cell Buses. A dedicated 1.25 MW solar plant is also being set up at Leh by NTPC REL to power the hydrogen fuelling station.   NTPC Limited, India's largest integrated power generating company under Ministry of Power, has floated a global Expression of Interest (EoI) to set up a pilot project on hydrogen blending with natural gas in City Gas Distribution (CGD) Network in India,  a company statement said.  This pilot on hydrogen blending with natural gas will be the first of its kind in India and would explore the viability of decarbonising India's natural gas grid.  NTPC with its ambition of playing a key role in India's transition to hydrogen economy would later take this up at a commercial scale across India.  The successful execution of the pilot will also demonstrate the decarbonisation objective along with import substitution aim under the government's 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan'.  NTPC Ltd is also keenly exploring production of green ammonia to decarbonise the fertilizer industry and possibly fulfil government's upcoming mandate of using certain percentage of green hydrogen in fertilizer and refinery sector.  Also, detailed study on green methanol production at Ramagundam has been completed and the company is expected to take final investment decision in the near future.",

        "articleBody": "Blue hydrogen is often touted as a low-carbon fuel for generating electricity and storing energy, powering cars, trucks and trains and heating buildings.  But according to a new report by Cornell and Stanford University researchers in the US, it may be no better for the climate - and potentially a fair bit worse - than continuing to use fossil natural gas, which currently keeps 85% of UK homes warm. In the US, about half of all homes use natural gas for space and water heating. So what is hydrogen fuel - and what makes it blue? According to the International Energy Agency, 96% of hydrogen produced worldwide is made using fossil fuels - coal, oil and natural gas - in a process known as reforming. This involves combining fossil fuels with steam, and heating them to around 800\u00b0C. Eventually, you get carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and hydrogen. These two gases are then separated. The CO\u2082 is often emitted to the atmosphere where it contributes to global heating, and the hydrogen is extracted and used in everything from car engines to boilers, releasing water vapour.  The hydrogen rainbow Grey hydrogen is the most common form. The colour simply denotes how it's made, and this kind is generated from natural gas (which mostly consists of methane and ethane), the fossil fuel which powers most gas boilers and stoves and which scientists have identified as an important source of carbon emissions that governments need to eliminate.  Brown hydrogen uses lignite coal (also known as brown coal, generated over millions of years by compressed peat deposits) or oil. Black hydrogen is produced using bituminous coal - a tar-like substance. The process of extracting hydrogen from all of these options emits CO\u2082 to differing degrees, and so they are not a suitable pathway for reaching net zero emissions with hydrogen. Green hydrogen, meanwhile, is produced by using zero-carbon electricity - such as that generated by wind turbines or solar panels - to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The process is carbon-neutral, but green hydrogen is very expensive, and is expected to remain so until at least 2030. But blue hydrogen, it's hoped, particularly by the US and UK governments, is different. Blue hydrogen is produced using the same reforming process that is used to create grey, brown and black hydrogen, but the CO\u2082 that would ordinarily be released is captured and stored underground. Carbon capture and storage equipment is expensive, raising the price of the fuel, but it at least provides for low-carbon fuel production at a lower cost than green hydrogen. Out of the blue The process of making blue hydrogen also requires a lot of energy. For every unit of heat in the natural gas at the start of the process, only 70-75% of that potential heat remains in the hydrogen product. In others words, if the hydrogen is used to heat a building, you would need to use 25% more natural gas to make blue hydrogen than if it was used directly for heat. And as reported by the US Environmental Protection Agency, methane - the primary component of natural gas and a byproduct of using it to produce blue hydrogen - is a much more potent global warming gas than CO\u2082 over shorter timescales. On a 100-year basis, methane has a global warming potential 28-36 times greater than CO\u2082, so one molecule of methane in the atmosphere has the same effect as around 30 molecules of CO\u2082.  In the first study of its kind to consider blue hydrogen's environmental impact over its entire lifecycle, the US researchers found that methane emissions released when the fossil natural gas is extracted and burned are much less than blue hydrogen. More methane needs to be extracted to make blue hydrogen, and it must pass through reformers, pipelines and ships, providing more opportunities for leaks: enough, the research indicates, to make blue hydrogen 20% worse for the climate than just using fossil gas. The new study casts doubt on the role that blue hydrogen might play in cutting greenhouse gas emissions from sectors like heating and heavy industry. As these new findings are picked over by the energy community, it's worth wondering how the news will be received in Westminster and Washington. The UK government is due to publish their delayed hydrogen strategy, which should set out where hydrogen will feature in the country's decarbonisation strategy. What is certain is that blue hydrogen may not be as green as it once appeared.

        "articleBody": "It is seen by many as the clean energy of the future. Billions of dollars from the bipartisan infrastructure bill have been teed up to fund it.But a new peer-reviewed study on the climate effects of hydrogen, the most abundant substance in the universe, casts doubt on its role in tackling the greenhouse gas emissions that are the driver of catastrophic global warming.The main stumbling block: Most hydrogen used today is extracted from natural gas in a process that requires a lot of energy and emits vast amounts of carbon dioxide. Producing natural gas also releases methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas.And while the natural gas industry has proposed capturing that carbon dioxide \u2014 creating what it promotes as emissions-free, \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen \u2014 even that fuel still emits more across its entire supply chain than simply burning natural gas, according to the paper, published Thursday in the Energy Science & Engineering journal by researchers from Cornell and Stanford universities.\u201cTo call it a zero-emissions fuel is totally wrong,\u201d said Robert Howarth, a biogeochemist and ecosystem scientist at Cornell and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cWhat we found is that it\u2019s not even a low-emissions fuel, either.\u201dTo arrive at their conclusion, Howarth and Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and director of its Atmosphere/Energy program, examined the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of blue hydrogen. They accounted for both carbon dioxide emissions and the methane that leaks from wells and other equipment during natural gas production.        The researchers assumed that 3.5% of the gas drilled from the ground leaks into the atmosphere, an assumption that draws on mounting research that has found that drilling for natural gas emits far more methane than previously known.They also took into account the natural gas required to power the carbon capture technology. In all, they found that the greenhouse gas footprint of blue hydrogen was more than 20% greater than burning natural gas or coal for heat. (Running the analysis at a far lower gas leak rate of 1.54% only reduced emissions slightly, and emissions from blue hydrogen still remained higher than from simply burning natural gas.)Such findings could alter the calculus for hydrogen. Over the past few years, the natural gas industry has begun heavily promoting hydrogen as a reliable, next-generation fuel to be used to power cars, heat homes and burn in power plants.In the United States, Europe and elsewhere, the industry has also pointed to hydrogen as justification for continuing to build gas infrastructure like pipelines, saying that pipes that carry natural gas could in the future carry a cleaner blend of natural gas and hydrogen.While many experts agree that hydrogen could eventually play a role in energy storage or powering certain types of transportation \u2014 such as aircraft or long-haul trucks, where switching to battery-electric power may be challenging \u2014 there is an emerging consensus that a wider hydrogen economy that relies on natural gas could be damaging to the climate.(At current costs, it would also be very expensive.)The latest study added to the evidence, said Drew Shindell, a professor of earth science at Duke University. Shindell was the lead author of a United Nations report published this year that found that slashing emissions of methane, the main component of natural gas, is far more vital in tackling global warming than previously thought. In a new report published this week, the U.N. warned that essentially all of the rise in global average temperatures since the 19th century has been driven by the burning of fossil fuels.The hydrogen study showed that \u201cthe potential to keep using fossil fuels with something extra added on as a potential climate solution is neither fully accounting for emissions, nor making realistic assumptions\u201d about future costs, he said in an email.The Hydrogen Council, an industry group founded in 2017 that includes BP, Shell and other big oil and gas companies, did not provide immediate comment. A McKinsey & Co. report co-authored with industry groups estimated that the hydrogen economy could generate $140 billion in annual revenue by 2030 and support 700,000 jobs. The study also projected that hydrogen could meet 14% of total U.S. energy demand by 2050. BP declined to comment.In Washington, the latest bipartisan infrastructure package devotes $8 billion to creating regional hydrogen hubs, a provision originally introduced as part of a separate bill by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a major natural-gas-producing region. Among companies that lobbied for investment in hydrogen were NextEra Energy, which has proposed a solar-powered hydrogen pilot plant in Florida.Some other Democrats, like Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, have pushed back against the idea, calling it an \u201cempty promise.\u201d Environmental groups have also criticized the spending. \u201cIt\u2019s not a climate action,\u201d said Jim Walsh, a senior energy policy analyst at Food & Water Watch, a Washington-based nonprofit group. \u201cThis is a fossil fuel subsidy with Congress acting like they\u2019re doing something on climate, while propping up the next chapter of the fossil fuel industry.\u201dJack Brouwer, director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at the University of California, Irvine, said that hydrogen would ultimately need to be made using renewable energy to produce what the industry calls green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy to split water into its constituent parts, hydrogen and oxygen. That, he said, would eliminate the fossil and the methane leaks.Hydrogen made from fossil fuels could still act as a transition fuel but would ultimately be \u201ca small contributor to the overall sustainable hydrogen economy,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst we use blue, then we make it all green,\u201d he said.Today, very little hydrogen is green, because the process involved \u2014 electrolyzing water to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen \u2014 is hugely energy intensive. In most places, there simply is not enough renewable energy to produce vast amounts of green hydrogen. (Although if the world does start to produce excess renewable energy, converting it to hydrogen would be one way to store it.)For the foreseeable future, most hydrogen fuel will very likely be made from natural gas through an energy-intensive and polluting method called the steam-reforming process, which uses steam, high heat and pressure to break down the methane into hydrogen and carbon dioxide.Blue hydrogen uses the same process but applies carbon capture and storage technology, which involves capturing carbon dioxide before it is released into the atmosphere and then pumping it underground in an effort to lock it away. But that still does not account for the natural gas that generates the hydrogen, powers the steam-reforming process and runs the CO2 capture. \u201cThose are substantial,\u201d Howarth of Cornell said.Amy Townsend-Small, an associate professor in environmental science at the University of Cincinnati and an expert on methane emissions, said more scientists were starting to examine some of the industry claims around hydrogen, in the same way they had scrutinized the climate effects of natural gas production. \u201cI think this research is going drive the conversation forward,\u201d she said.Plans to produce and use hydrogen are moving ahead. National Grid, together with Stony Brook University and New York state, is studying integrating hydrogen into its existing gas infrastructure, though the project seeks to produce hydrogen using renewable energy.Entergy believed hydrogen was \u201cpart of creating a long-term carbon-free future,\u201d complementing renewables like wind or solar, which generate power only intermittently, said Jerry Nappi, a spokesperson for the utility. \u201cHydrogen is an important technology that will allow utilities to adopt much greater levels of renewables,\u201d he said.National Grid referred to its net-zero plan, which says hydrogen will play a major role in the next few decades and that producing hydrogen from renewable energy was the linchpin.New York state was \u201cexploring all technologies,\u201d including hydrogen, in support of its climate goals, said Kate Muller, a spokesperson for the state\u2019s Energy Research and Development Authority. Still, its researchers would \u201creview and consider the blue hydrogen paper,\u201d she said.",

Further, no new coal-based capacity was added in Q1 for the first time in more than 14 quarters, it said.The report showed total generation in Q1 FY22 was up by 17.2% compared to Q1 FY21, owing to record peak power demand in India during summers and economic recovery after the relaxation of Covid-19 second wave led lockdown.The overall renewable generation increased by 15%, while large hydro generation dipped by 11.7%, and coal/lignite generation grew significantly by 27.9% over Q1 FY21.The share of renewable energy in average daily generation remained nearly the same in Q1 FY22 as the corresponding period last year, the report said.",

        "articleBody": "Sentinet Lab, an R&D innovation lab, incubated by KPIT Technologies with initial technical inputs and MACS - Agharkar Research Institute (ARI), have claimed to have developed the world\u2019s first technology that generates hydrogen directly from agricultural residue for use in fuel cell-powered vehicles.Sentient Labs' has identified bottlenecks in battery technology, fuel cell technologies, and technologies for hydrogen generation. Multiple efforts are underway to create the building blocks necessary for sustainable mobility.MACS-Agharkar Research Institute conducts basic as well as applied research in life sciences and harnesses the genetic diversity of microbes for bio-energy generation and has been working towards developing solutions which are appropriate for national use.Elaborating about the need for use of hydrogen fuel, the researchers said that the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technology is estimated to be the next big step in the direction of sustainable mobility as it provides a large operating range, is suitable for commercial vehicles, and leaves a minimal environmental footprint. The need of the hour in crude oil-importing nations is to rapidly move towards self-reliant energy sources and sustainable mobility. The hydrogen generated from this technology will be utilized to power fuel cell vehicles that emit only water, thus making the entire cycle pollution-free.A joint release issued by the two organisations said,  This hydrogen generation technology uses agricultural residue rich in cellulose and hemicellulose content \u2013 in likes of paddy, wheat, or maize residue. The process uses microbial culture for the direct generation of hydrogen from agricultural residues. It further generates methane, which is utilized for producing additional hydrogen by steam methane reformation. This process can avoid the burning of biomass generated in large measure in the Indian countryside and generate organic manure and CO2, which finds applications in various industries.  It added:  A pertinent sustainability aspect of the innovation is that it models on the circular economy. In India, approximately 200 million tons of unutilized agricultural residue is generated. This agricultural residue, which is burnt in most of the cases, can be fed into this process to generate hydrogen.  Ravi Pandit, Chairman, Sentient Labs said,  We incubated Sentient Labs to work on technology R&D projects related to mobility and energy. This innovation affirms our commitment to Mission Hydrogen and Make in India charter by the government. This breakthrough of generating hydrogen from unutilized agricultural residue will help us become self-reliant on energy resources. It will also add a major stream of revenue to the farmer community. We will continue R&D and invite partners to come on board for production and commercialising the same.\u201dPrashant Dhakephalkar, Director, Agharkar Research Institute, said,  Our technology is 25% more efficient as compared to conventional anaerobic digestion processes used today. The innovative two stage process eliminates the pre-treatment of the biomass, thus making the process economical and environment friendly. This biologically benign process generates digestate rich in nutrients which can be used as organic fertilizer. Its by-products can be used as soil conditioners while undigested solids for briquetting can be sold as solid fuel. I thank the scientists and engineers at Agharkar Research Institute & Sentient Labs for this achievement\u201d.Pawan Sharma, President & CEO, Sentient Labs said, \u201cThe milestone in collaboration with Sentient Labs has the potential to radically transform the agricultural industry and garner new sources of value-creation. It will improve India\u2019s self-reliance in creating cleaner and sustainable solutions for the energy and transportation sectors and will help India comply with the Paris Climate Change agreement.\u201dThe key members of the team that worked on this technology are Prashant Dhakephalkar and Sumit Singh Dagar from Agharkar Research Institute and Kaustubh Pathak from Sentient Labs.",

ReNew had not disclosed the seller in its release.ACME did not immediately respond to ET's queries about this deal.The rest of the investment amount of \u20b9985 crore went to L&T. With this sale, L&T has completely divested its stake from the hydropower business. The infrastructure giant had earlier committed to selling its non-core assets to improve shareholder value.The solar project was signed on a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA), out of which four years have been completed already. The hydropower project has a shelf-life of approximately 35 years, and will supply 360 million electricity units annually.\u201cWe believe that the acquisition of these assets is expected to earn an attractive return within our targeted range and is proof that ReNew is uniquely positioned to be a big beneficiary of the consolidation of renewable energy assets in India, said Sumant Sinha, chairman and chief executive officer of ReNew Power.Speaking about the hydropower purchase, Sinha added:  The hydropower acquisition strengthens our ability to provide reliable and dispatchable power to the grid which complements our solar and wind assets. ReNew earlier this year formally announced its public listing on NASDAQ through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with RMG Acquisition Corp II at a valuation of $8 billion.These acquisitions take the Gurgaon-based company's total capacity over 10,400 MW. ReNew has a target of achieving 18,000 MW by 2025.",

Ambri got a total $144 million from RIL subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd, US-based investment firm Paulson & Co, tech mogul Bill Gates and other strategic investors. RIL will acquire 42.3 million shares of preferred stock in the company. The transaction follows Ambani\u2019s June announcement on investing \u20b975,000 crore over the next three years to build a new clean energy business to fuel RIL\u2019s commitment to be net carbon neutral by 2035.   85229233\u201cThe investment will help the company commercialise and grow its long-duration energy storage systems business globally,\u201d RIL said in the statement. The company said it is in discussions for an exclusive collaboration to set up a large-scale battery manufacturing facility in India, which could add scale and further lower costs for Reliance\u2019s green energy initiative. Long-duration Batteries to Help  Ambri, birthed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was founded in 2010 by Donald Sadoway and David Bradwell to develop liquid metal battery technology. Ambri has patented technology and designs to manufacture long-duration energy storage systems that can last four to 24 hours and cater to projects that require from 10 megawatts to over 2 gigawatts per hour. That\u2019s suitable for high-usage applications such as shifting energy from daytime solar generation to evening and morning peak load times. India aims to scale up its renewable energy capacity to 450 GW by 2030, of which a majority 60% would be from solar power. With the current installed capacity at 45 GW and another 55 GW in the pipeline, India needs an additional 200 GW of solar capacity to meet its target. There\u2019s also a big need for back-up power that can be supplied when the first is not available. Typically, countries use gas-based and hydropower to reduce the intermittency inherent in renewable power, but India has not been able to build these capacities and utility scale batteries may help fill this gap.",

The battery maker would be focusing more on the new-age energy storage systems such as Lithium-ion Technology keeping in view the market trends as Lead Acid battery market growth rate is expected to taper off over a period of time, S Vijayanand, President, New Energy wing of Amara Raja said.  So we are talking about a close to USD one billion investments for a 10 to 12 Gigawatt hours (Lithium-ion battery) facility under the ACC(Advanced Chemistry Cell) PLI (Production Linked Incentives) Scheme of the government. The time period for execution is dependent on the market demand growth, but we foresee that this investment could happen over a period of 5 to 7 years,  Vijayanand said. In May, the Centre approved the PLI (Production Linked Incentives) scheme for manufacturing ACC (Advanced Chemistry Cell) batteries at an estimated outlay ofRs 18,100 crore. Vijayanand said Amamra Raja has been making about Rs 400 to Rs 500 crore investment on capex and sustaining the existing businesses traditionally every year. Replying to a query, he said the Amara Raja is expecting 15 to 17 per cent growth in revenues in the next five years and hoped that it would become a USD two billion entity by then. Amara Raja Batteries clocked Rs 7,150 crore revenues in FY21 registering Rs 647 crore net profit. Without giving a direct reply on media reports that the company mulls to move its manufacturing base for Chittoor to some other state, he said,  There is no locational risk that we are continuing to have in terms of putting all your eggs in one basket.  Vijayanand said the future investments will be dependent on growth requirements and maker needs. Amara Raja Board recently inducted Harshavardhana Gourineni and Vikramaditya Gourineni as Executive Directors.",

Presently, very few countries are using this method. The trial of one rake is being done in Germany and the trial of the other in Poland, it said.The bidding date for hydrogen fuel cell-based DEMU rake will start from September 21, 2021 and the closing date will be October 5, 2021 A pre-bid conference will be held on August 17.",

The policy offered a huge range of incentives to investors' investing in the sector.However, incentives will be applicable to Ethanol units selling their produce to the Oil Manufacturing Companies (OMCs) The State Cabinet has approved the Assam Ethanol Production Promotion Policy 2021. The Policy shall be valid upto 31st March 2026.Assam\u2019s industries and commerce minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said that Assam is the second State in the country to bring out an ethanol policy, and is thus among the pioneers in the line.The incentives under the Policy to standalone green-field ethanol producing industrial units \u2013 catering solely to Oil Manufacturing Companies (OMCs) for blending with petrol and diesel include Capital Subsidy at 20% of the cost of Plant and Machinery, with maximum Rs 5 crores \u2013 in addition to the 30% Capital Subsidy under provision of under North East Industrial Development Scheme (NEIDS)2017.Besides power Subsidy Re 1 per unit, in addition to the Rs 2 per unit offered under Industrial and Investment Policy of Assam 2019, for a period of 5 years from the date of industrial production; subject to an overall maximum of Rs 75 lakhs per annum. 5% Interest Subsidy on working capital loan for 5 years subject to an overall ceiling of Rs 50 lakhs per annum, in addition to the 2% interest subsidy offered under Industrial and Investment Policy of Assam 2019; and the 3% interest subsidy under NEIDS 2017;The policy offered, \u201c100% SGST Reimbursement for a period of 5 years, upper limit being 250% of Fixed Capital Investment; in addition to the reimbursement of the central share of the CGST, IGST and Income Tax offered under NEIDS 2017 for a period of 5 years; 100% Exemption of Land Conversion Fees for conversion of land to industrial class, Employment Incentive in the form of reimbursement of expenditure on account of provident fund contribution of permanent resident employees for 5 years; and Skill Development Subsidy of Rs 20,000 per employee, the incentive being applicable only for training of permanent resident employees.The eligible units shall also enjoy 100% exemption of Stamp Duty and Registration Fees, subject to a monetary ceiling of Rs 25 lakhs only.The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas formulated the National Policy on Biofuels 2018, which aims to increase the usage of biofuel in the energy and the transportation sector. India\u2019s net import of petroleum was 185 million metric tonnes at a cost of US $55 billion in 2020-21 with a lion\u2019s share of its utilization having been in the transportation sector.Promoting the use of biofuel like ethanol as a blend stock with main automotive fuel like petrol or diesel can definitely alleviate the draining of the Forex Reserves.NITI Aayog has also brought out a detailed Roadmap for Ethanol Blending in India. The minister said,   Assam has four refineries and produces huge amounts of petrol and diesel, which ensures viability and promise for ethanol projects in Assam. IOCL, which has been importing ethanol for its blending programme and the company is contemplating setting up a captive ethanol plant. Several investors have sent feelers for investing in the sector.\u201dHe said Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) wherein Assam Government has recently raised its share to 26%, is undertaking a JV project with 2 European companies to set up a bio refinery near its existing refinery in Numaligarh which on being commissioned in 2022-23 shall convert 300,000 tons of dry bamboo annually into bio-ethanol and other biofuels. NRL has a 50% stake in the Rs 2600 crore project. Ethanol imports reached a record 750 million liters in 2019, covering over 30% of its total demand. Domestic ethanol production can attenuate the import graph, and the Ethanol Policy of Assam can go a long way in fulfilling that role.",

        "articleBody": "Indian researchers have come up with an innovative hydrogen manufacturing route which increases its production three times and lowers the energy required that could pave the way towards environment-friendly hydrogen fuel at a lower cost, the DST said on Wednesday. As a fuel, hydrogen has a critical role to play in driving the paradigm shift towards a green and sustainable economy. In addition to having about three-fold higher calorific value compared to non-renewable energy sources such as coal and gasoline, the combustion of hydrogen to release energy produces water and is thus completely non-polluting. Due to the extremely low abundance of molecular hydrogen in the earth's atmosphere, electric-field driven breakdown of water is an attractive route for production of hydrogen. However, such electrolysis requires high energy input and is associated with slow rate of hydrogen production. The use of expensive platinum and iridium-based catalysts also discourages it for wide-spread commercialisation. Therefore, the transition to 'green-hydrogen-economy' demands approaches that lower the energy and material costs and simultaneously improve the hydrogen production rate, the statement added. A team of researchers from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, led by C Subramaniam, have come up with an innovative route that provides viable solutions to all these challenges. It involves electrolysis of water in the presence of an external magnetic field. In this method, the same system that produces one ml of hydrogen gas required 19 per cent lower energy to produce three ml of hydrogen in the same time. This is achieved by synergistically coupling the electric and magnetic fields at the catalytic site. The simple approach also provides the capability to retrofit any existing electrolysed (that uses electricity to break water into hydrogen and oxygen) with external magnets without drastic change in the design, leading to increased energy efficiency of hydrogen production. This proof-of-concept demonstration for producing hydrogen has been published in ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, the statement said. The electrocatalytic material -- cobalt-oxide nanocubes that are dispersed over hard-carbon based nanostructured carbon florets -- is of prime importance to achieve this effect and was developed with the support of the Department of Science and Technology's Material for Energy Storage programme at Technology Mission Division. It was put to use for magneto-electrocatalysis through the DST-SERB grant. The interface between the carbon and cobalt oxide is key to magneto-electrocatalysis. It is advantageous as it forms a system that does not require the constant presence of the external magnetic field and is able to sustain the magnetisation for prolonged time periods; magnitude of the enhancements achieved (650 per cent increase in current density, 19 per cent lowering of energy required and a three-fold increase in volumetric hydrogen production rate) is unparalleled, the intermittent magnetic field required is similar to what a fridge magnet can provide. This route can be directly adopted in existing electrolysers without any change in design or mode of operation and one-time exposure of magnetic field for 10 minutes is enough to achieve the high rate of hydrogen production for over 45 minutes.  The intermittent use of an external magnetic field provides a new direction for achieving energy-efficient hydrogen generation. Other catalysts can also be explored for this purpose,  said Subramaniam.  A basic electrolyser cell of 0.5 nm3/h (normal mater cubed per hour) capacity can be immediately upgraded to a 1.5 nm3/h capacity by replacing the catalysts and supplying the magnetic field,  added Jayeeta Saha and Ranadeb Ball, students who were supported by the DST funding.  Given the importance of hydrogen-based economy, we aim to implement the project in a mission-mode and realise an indigenous magneto-electrolytic hydrogen generator,  said Subramaniam.",

        "articleBody": "On a highway south of Frankfurt recently, Thomas Schmieder maneuvered his Scania tractor-trailer and its load of house paint into the far right lane. Then he flicked a switch you won\u2019t find on most truck dashboards.Outside the cab a contraption started to unfold from the roof, looking like a clothes-drying rack with an upside-down sled welded to the top. As Schmieder continued driving, a video display showed the metal skids rising up and pushing gently against wires running overhead.The cab became very quiet as the diesel engine cut out and electric motors took over. The truck was still a truck, but now it was powered like many trains or streetcars.There\u2019s a debate over how to make the trucking industry free of emissions, and whether batteries or hydrogen fuel cells are the best way to fire up electric motors in big vehicles. Schmieder was part of a test of a third alternative: a system that feeds electricity to trucks as they drive, using wires strung above the roadway and a pantograph mounted on the cab.At one level the idea makes perfect sense. The system is energy efficient because it delivers power directly from the electrical grid to the motors. The technology saves weight and money because batteries tend to be heavy and expensive, and a truck using overhead wires needs only a big enough battery to get from the off-ramp to its final destination.And the system is relatively simple. Siemens, the German electronics giant that provided the hardware for this test route, adapted equipment that has been used for decades to drive trains and urban streetcars.At another level the idea is insane. Who\u2019s going to pay to string thousands of miles of high voltage electrical cable above the world\u2019s major highways?Figuring out how to make trucks emissions free is a crucial part of the fight against climate change and dirty air. Long-haul diesel trucks produce a disproportionate share of greenhouse gases and other pollutants because they spend so much time on the road.But the industry is divided. Daimler and Volvo, the world\u2019s two biggest truck makers, are betting on hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul rigs. They argue that the heavy batteries needed to provide acceptable range are impractical for trucks because they subtract too much capacity from payload.Traton, the company that owns truck makers Scania, MAN and Navistar, argues that hydrogen is too expensive and inefficient, because of the energy needed to produce it. Traton, majority owned by Volkswagen, is betting on ever-improving batteries \u2014 and on electrified highways.Traton is among the backers of the so-called eHighway south of Frankfurt, a group that also includes Siemens and Autobahn GmbH, the government agency that oversees German highways. There are also short segments of electrified road in the states of Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The technology has been tried in Sweden and, in 2017, on a 1-mile stretch near the Port of Los Angeles.The sections of highway equipped with overhead cable in Germany are short \u2014 about 3 miles long in both directions near Frankfurt. Their purpose is to test how the system performs in everyday use by real trucking companies hauling real goods. By the end of the year more than 20 trucks will be using the systems in Germany.Enter Schmieder, who learned to drive a truck in the German army, and his employer, a trucking firm called Schanz Spedition in the small town of Ober-Ramstadt, in a hilly, thickly forested region about a 35-mile drive from Frankfurt.If the eHighway is ever going to be rolled out on a large scale, it has to work for companies like Schanz, a family-owned firm managed by Christine Hemmel and Kerstin Seibert, sisters who are great-granddaughters of the founder. Their father, Hans Adam Schanz, though technically retired, was at the wheel of a forklift maneuvering pallets into the back of a truck recently as Schmieder climbed into the cab for his second run of the day hauling paint to a distribution center in Frankfurt.Business is brisk, Schmieder said, because lockdowns have prompted a home-improvement craze and fueled demand for paint manufactured at a factory next door to Schanz\u2019s headquarters.Schmieder makes the same run up to five times a day. That\u2019s the kind of route that the eHighway\u2019s backers see as ideal.Hasso Gr\u00fcnjes, who oversees Siemens\u2019 involvement in the project, said it would make sense to first electrify heavily traveled routes, such as the one between the Dutch port of Rotterdam and Duisburg, in Germany\u2019s industrial heartland; or the highway connecting the German ports of Hamburg and L\u00fcbeck.Large numbers of trucks do nothing but drive back and forth between those destinations, Gr\u00fcnjes said. Trucking companies that use the routes would save money on fuel, their biggest cost, and easily justify the investment in trucks with rooftop pantographs. Longer term, according to Siemens figures, 4,000 kilometers of wired highway, or 2,400 miles, would accommodate 60% of German truck traffic. Siemens said Thursday that it would cooperate with German auto parts supplier Continental to mass produce the pantographs.But the onus would be on the German government to build the overhead cables, which cost an estimated 2.5 million euros per kilometer, or about $5 million per mile.Germany\u2019s Ministry for Environment, which is funding the three electrified highways in Germany, is comparing the results with studies of trucks using hydrogen fuel cells and trucks using batteries. In three or four years, the ministry said in a statement, a decision will be made on which technology to support.\u201cNumerous studies have come to the conclusion that overhead cable trucks, despite the high infrastructure costs, are the most cost-effective option,\u201d the ministry said.But, responding to questions from The New York Times, the ministry noted that batteries are getting cheaper and better all the time, and charging times are dropping. \u201cIn the final analysis, the total cost of infrastructure, vehicles and energy will decide what technology or combination of technologies prevails,\u201d the ministry said.The government is being cautious because of the risk that taxpayers would pay for electrified highways only for the technology to be shunned by the trucking industry or rendered obsolete by something else.\u201cIn theory it\u2019s the best idea,\u201d said Geert De Cock, an electricity and energy specialist at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. But he said the political obstacles, for example getting European governments to agree on technical standards, are too daunting.\u201cIt\u2019s a coordination issue more than a technology issue,\u201d De Cock said. \u201cWe don\u2019t support it because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201dSchmieder, the truck driver, is a believer. He applied for a job at Schanz in 2019, when the test project was getting started, so he could be part of it.\u201cI\u2019m always very interested in electromobility and where it\u2019s going,\u201d he said, as he steered the Scania through a narrow valley that leads from Schanz headquarters to the A5 highway. The truck, a hybrid that has a diesel engine, an electric motor and a small battery, passed a sign pointing to Frankenstein Castle, said to have inspired the fictional monster.Soon after Schmieder drove up a ramp onto the A5, the pylons supporting the overhead cables of the eHighway came into view. Inside the cab, the transition was barely perceptible as Schmieder deployed the pantograph that connects to the overhead cables, a so-called catenary system.The cables also recharged the Scania\u2019s battery, which stores enough power to drive short distances emission-free in urban traffic. That is another advantage of the catenary system: The eHighway could eliminate the need for charging stops, important in the trucking industry where time is money.\u201cThe infrastructure requires a lot of resources,\u201d Manfred Boltze, a professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt, which is providing advice and analysis, said by email. \u201cOn the other hand it provides very high energy efficiency and only small batteries are needed for the journeys beyond the overhead cables.\u201dSchmieder rested his hands lightly on the steering wheel as autonomous driving software held the truck directly under the cables. He and other drivers underwent a one-day training program to learn how to use the system and deal with problems, such as an accident blocking the lane ahead. That has happened to Schmieder, he said. He simply steered out from under the overhead cables into another lane using the truck\u2019s diesel engine.There have been occasional technical glitches. A few times sensors have failed. \u201cBut big problems? No,\u201d Schmieder said.Technology, pretty much everyone agrees, is not the biggest obstacle to a global network of electric roads.\u201cWe\u2019ve shown it can be built,\u201d Gr\u00fcnjes said. \u201cThe question now is how to build on a larger scale.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Sugar mills are likely to earn revenues of about Rs 15,000 crore in the 2020-21 marketing year ending November by selling ethanol to oil marketing companies (OMCs), the government said on Tuesday. In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Food and Consumer Affairs Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said the country is self reliant in sugar production. In a normal sugar season (October-September), production of sugar in the country is around 320-330 lakh tonne as against the domestic consumption of 260 lakh tonne, she said.Due to surplus production, the minister said the ex-mill prices of sugar remain subdued resulting in cash loss to sugar mills. This excess stock of 60-70 lakh tonne also leads to blockage of funds and affects the liquidity of sugar mills resulting in accumulation of cane price arrears of farmers.  In order to find a long-term solution to deal with the problem of sugar, Government is encouraging sugar mills to divert excess sugarcane to ethanol which is blended with petrol, which not only serves as a green fuel but also saves foreign exchange on account of crude oil import,  Jyoti said. The revenue generated from sale of ethanol by mills helps sugar mills in clearing cane price dues of farmers, she added.  In past three sugar seasons 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, about Rs 22,000 crore revenue was generated by sugar mills/distilleries from sale of ethanol to OMCs which has helped in clearing cane price arrears of farmers.  In current ethanol supply year (December-November), about Rs 15,000 crore revenue is likely to be generated by sugar mills from sale of ethanol to OMCs,  the minister said. In the last two sugar seasons 2018-19 and 2019-20, about 3.32 lakh tonne and 9.26 lakh tonne of sugar were diverted to ethanol, respectively. During the current sugar season 2020-21, more than 20 lakh tonne is likely to be diverted.  In the next season 2021-22, about 35 lakh tonne of sugar is estimated to be diverted and by 2025 about 60 lakh tonne of excess sugar is targeted to be diverted to ethanol, which is likely to solve the problem of excess sugarcane/sugar,  the minister said.",

        "articleBody": "Japan aims to drastically increase its renewable energy use and reduce fossil fuel consumption over the next decade as its pushes to meet its ambitious emissions reduction target, according to a draft of a new energy plan presented Wednesday. The draft, however, maintains the current target for nuclear energy as officials remain undecided over what to do with the nuclear industry, which has struggled since the 2011 Fukushima power plant disaster. The economy and industry ministry's draft energy plan says renewables should account for 36-38% of the power supply in 2030, up from the current target of 22-24%, and that newly introduced fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia should comprise 1%. The new plan slashes the use of fossil fuel from 56% to 41%. The government updates its basic energy plan every few years. The draft is expected to be approved by the Cabinet later this year. The changes are meant to achieve a carbon emissions reduction target announced in April. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged that Japan will strive to reduce its emissions by 46% from 2012 levels, up from an earlier target of 26%, to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. He said Japan would try to push the reduction as high as 50% to be in line with the European Union. China has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060. The target for nuclear power remains unchanged at 20-22%. The draft says Japan aims to reduce its reliance on nuclear power as much as possible but that it will remain an important energy source. Japan also plans to continue its nuclear fuel reprocessing cycle, in which spent nuclear fuel is converted to plutonium, despite the failure of its Monju plutonium-burning reactor and international concerns over safeguards for its plutonium stockpile. The 2050 emissions-free target will require drastic changes and likely prompt calls for a restart of more nuclear plants. Progress toward reducing Japan's reliance on fossil fuels has been hindered by the prolonged closure of most of its nuclear plants after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The nuclear energy target will be difficult to achieve because of persistent anti-nuclear sentiment among the public. Twenty-four of Japan's 54 workable reactors had been assigned to be decommissioned since the Fukushima disaster, as utility companies opted to scrap old reactors rather than spend huge amounts to add safety measures required under stricter post-Fukushima standards. Nine reactors are currently online. The draft did not mention the possibility of new reactors, despite such calls from some industry officials and pro-nuclear lawmakers.",

        "articleBody": "India's largest oil firm IOC will build the nation's first 'green hydrogen' plant at its Mathura refinery, as it aims to prepare for a future catering to the growing demand for both oil and cleaner forms of energy.  Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has drawn a strategic growth path that aims to maintain focus on its core refining and fuel marketing businesses while making bigger inroads into petrochemicals, hydrogen and electric mobility over the next 10 years, its chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said.  The company will not set captive power plants at all its future refinery and petrochemical expansion projects and instead use the 250 MW of electricity it produces from renewable sources like solar power, he told in an interview.   We have a wind power project in Rajasthan. We intend to wheel that power to our Mathura refinery and use that electricity to produce absolutely green hydrogen through electrolysis,  he said.  This will be the nation's first green hydrogen unit. Previously, projects have been announced to produce 'grey hydrogen' using fossil fuels such as natural gas.  Hydrogen is the latest buzz for meeting the world's energy needs. Hydrogen, in itself, is a clean fuel but manufacturing it is energy-intensive and has carbon byproducts.  Brown hydrogen is created through coal gasification while the process of producing grey hydrogen throws off carbon waste. Blue hydrogen uses carbon capture and storage for the greenhouse gases produced in the creation of grey hydrogen.  Green hydrogen production - the ultimate clean hydrogen resource - uses renewable energy to create hydrogen fuel.   Mathura has been selected by virtue of its proximity to TTZ (Taj Trapezium Zone),  Vaidya said adding the green hydrogen will replace carbon-emitting fuels that are used in the refinery to process crude oil into value-added products such as petrol and diesel.  He said all of the expansion projects will use grid electricity, preferably green power to meet the energy requirements.   We have got a number of expansions down the line which are already approved. We will not have a captive power plant and will utilise power from the grid, preferably green power. This will help decarbonise some part of the manufacturing,  he said.  IOC's refinery expansion plans include raising the capacity of units at Panipat in Haryana and Barauni in Bihar and setting up a new unit near Chennai.   We are going to add 25 million tonnes of our refining capacity by the year 2023-24. We are 80.5 million tonnes now including CPCL, we are going to be 105 million tonnes,  he said.  Vaidya said IOC was pushing ahead with research on carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies -- space where it is seeking global collaboration to meet its Paris climate goals.  Hydrogen, he said, would be a fuel of the future. IOC is planning to set up several hydrogen production units on a pilot basis.  This includes a project at Gujarat refinery to produce finite purity hydrogen of 99.9999 per cent for hydrogen fuel cell buses.  Today, 50 buses in Delhi are being fueled by hydrogen-spiked compressed natural gas, or H-CNG, which has 18 per cent hydrogen content,  he said adding hydrogen fuel cell buses will be put to service on iconic routes of Vadodara-Sabarmati and Vadodara-Statue of Unity, Kevedia.   About 15 fuel-cell-powered buses, with the fuel cells entirely India-made, are expected to ply in the second half of 2021. Since running these buses would require hydrogen, IOC is setting up a plant, whose capacity could be anywhere between 200 tonnes and 400 tonnes per day,  he added.  Petroleum refining and marketing will continue to be IOC's core businesses with much higher petrochemicals integration. Also, gas will play a larger role and the firm will have a presence in electric mobility space through charging stations at petrol pumps and a planned battery manufacturing unit.  Forecasts by various agencies see Indian fuel demand climbing to 400-450 million tonnes by 2040 as against 250 million tonnes now. This gives enough legroom for all forms of energy to co-exist, he said adding the demand growth makes it imperative to pursue refining expansion as well as expand footprint in compressed natural gas, LNG, biodiesel and ethanol.  Vaidya said IOC had already commissioned battery swapping stations across many cities. The firm already has installed 286 charging stations, including swapping stations, across the country, which will be raised to 3,000 EV charging stations in the next few years.",

        "articleBody": "ICRA expects credit profile of integrated sugar mills to witness material improvement in 2022-23 aided by improving inventory position and higher profits from higher ethanol supplies post commissioning of enhanced distillery capacities. High ethanol sales, especially from B-heavy molasses, would drive the revenues and operating profits expansion, reduced inventory levels would curtail industry\u2019s dependence on borrowings thereby strengthening the coverage metrics of the integrated sugar mills. Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President & Group Head, ICRA says, \u201cAdvancement of Ethanol Blended Petrol-EBP20 along with favourable policies such as remunerative pricing of ethanol, easing of regulations to enable interstate movements as well as relatively relaxed procurement procedures by oil marketing companies has enthused large sugar mills to step up their distillery capacities. The resultant ramp up of ethanol supplies augurs well for the credit profile. We expect reduced inventory levels and thereby lowering borrowings and interest costs; this would meaningfully bolster the credit metrics of the sector from FY2023. The net debt/OPBITDA of ICRA sample of sugar companies would meaningfully moderate to less than 1x in FY2023 from over 2x in FY2021 considering the ethanol supply ramp up.\u201d Domestic sugar production is expected to increase by 12.7% to 30.9 million MT in SY2021 and outstrip consumption by around 4.9 million MT. The sugar exports are expected at around 7.0 million MT supported by the export incentives and firmed up international sugar prices. Hence, the closing stocks are likely to remain at around 8.6 million MT as on September 30, 2021 (lower than September 30, 2020 levels by 2.1 million MT), which is still higher than normative sugar stock levels of 6.0\u20136.5 million MT. Although higher diversion towards ethanol has already started getting reflected positively in revenue and operating profit growth for the industry for the past 3 years, the impact of the same may get amplified from FY 2023 onwards as enhanced distillery capacities start yielding results.  In the medium term, favourable policy initiatives towards higher diversion of sugar towards ethanol production, along with occasional sugar exports, is likely substantially reduce the sugar surplus and allow improvement in the demand supply dynamics of the industry on a sustainable basis, thereby supporting the domestic sugar prices. In the current fiscal, however, the revenues and operating margins of sugar companies are likely to remain at similar levels of FY2021 with the benefit of increased cane diversion towards B-heavy molasses being partly offset by expectations of higher production cost, reduced export subsidy as well as export volume,  said ICRA.  Anupama Arora, sector Head, ICRA,\u201cGiven that the subsidy on sugar exports may be permitted only till December 2023 as per the country\u2019s commitment to the WTO, the sugar industry has started diverting the excess sugar towards ethanol with about 2.1 million MT of sugar been estimated to be sacrificed in ongoing SY2021. However, continued Government support for the sugar industry remains critical for supporting the profitability of the sugar companies going forward in light of excess sugar stocks. Even as the favourable policy environment facilitates ethanol supply ramp up, few issues still remain to be addressed such as ramp up of marketing infrastructure, ensure availability of ethanol pan India as well as attend to currently long procedural timelines for approvals for distillery set-up/expansion. Moreover, while interest subvention scheme for distillery capacities has been expanded over the past few years to cover more feedstocks, effective execution of tripartite agreement (among sugar mills, OMCs and bankers) can be a key enabler for higher participation from relatively moderate sized mills that may face challenges in access to finance.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "LG Energy Solution overtook CATL and topped in the global battery for electric vehicles market in May this year.  Samsung SDI and SK Innovation ranked 5th to 6th, and all three Korean companies have shown steady growth. According to SNE Research, a market research firm, the total battery energy of electric vehicles (excluding EV, PHEV, HEV electric buses and electric trucks) registered in the world in May was 19.7GWh. It increased more than 3.3 times compared to the previous year. The electric vehicle battery market had been contracted by the COVID-19 crisis in the first half of last year, but it has recovered steadily for 11 months. The recovery trend is expected to continue for the time being. Many Chinese companies, including CATL and BYD, showed outstanding performances. With the continued market expansion in China, most Chinese companies increased their market share. On the other hand, the growth rate of most Japanese companies including Panasonic fell short of the market average, and the market share also decreased. The three Korean companies showed unstable growth compared to the market average, but LG Energy Solution's rapid growth led to an increase in overall market share. LG Energy Solution jumped 3.7 times to 5.7GWh and ranked No. 1 again in the market that it gave to CATL in April. Samsung SDI increased by more than 2.6 times to 1.0GWh, but its ranking fell from 4th to 5th year-on-year. SK Innovation showed growth of more than 3.1 times and maintained its 6th place. The growth of the three companies is affected by the sales of EV models equipped with their batteries. LG Energy Solution recorded high growth as sales of Tesla Model Y (made in China), Volkswagen ID.4 and Skoda ENYAQ increased. The sales increase of Fiat 500 and Audi e-tron EV led Samsung SDI's growth. SK Innovation's market share increased significantly with the increased sales of Kia Niro EV and Hyundai IONIQ 5. ",

        "articleBody": "From purchasing power from  green generators  to allowing only solar operated vehicles for in-campus transportation and installing waste treatment plants in premises, universities and institutes across the country are taking strides to reduce their carbon footprint.  On the occasion of fifth anniversary of the Paris Climate agreement, vice chancellors of 12 leading universities and higher education institutions took a single-focused voluntary pledge called  Not zero, net zero  to develop the roadmap towards making their campuses carbon neutral.  Over 250 universities and institutions have joined the initiative since then.  Leading the way, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, became the first central government funded technical institute to reduce its carbon footprint by more than 50 per cent.   Availing green power through open access is an important initiative that we have taken in recent times to share our responsibility towards clean climate. Through many such proactive actions, we are making a good progress in achieving the plans to expand the green power purchase portfolio in the near future,  said IIT Delhi Director, V Rampgopal Rao.   Open access provisions in Electricity Act 2003 have made it possible to buy power from generators of their choice through bilateral contracts or energy exchange, for large consumers of power like IIT Delhi. We made use of these provisions to its advantage by involving PTC India Ltd as a trader to identify a source of 'green' power. Buying 2 MW of power exclusively from 'green' generator is equivalent to off-setting about 14000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually,  he added.  According to Rajendra Shende, Chairman, TERRE Policy Centre, the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP) in its latest ' Emission Gap Report' declared that the promises given by countries under Paris Climate Agreement are not adequate to achieve the objective of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015.   It is therefor essential that countries achieve the 'net zero emissions' within next 30-40 years. Net Zero emissions does not mean that emissions from human activities will be fully eliminated. Instead, it means that human-related emissions - from vehicles, agriculture, energy production, and so on - will be reduced to a level so low that they can be offset by efforts to absorb and otherwise remove emissions from the atmosphere, for example by tree plantation,  he said. Shende informed that Smart Campus Cloud Network ( SCCN) is the network of universities, a project by Technology, Education, Research and Rehabilitation for the Environment (TERRE) Policy Centre.   There is no more effective action than initiating 'Not Zero Net Zero' in the university campuses,  he said.  Joining the league, IIT Mandi has an active Green Committee which manages all green activities on campus.   As a second-generation IIT, barely a decade old, environmental conservation and reduced emission were included in the campus planning from the beginning. The following steps have already been implemented to reduce carbon footprint. As a technology and research institute of national importance, we see movement of large numbers of people across the country and abroad; both faculty and students, as well as the operation of high-power consuming research instruments.   Thus we understand that it is difficult to achieve complete carbon neutrality. But efforts are underway to shift to renewable energy sources as well as offsetting the carbon footprint through other activities,  CS Yadav, Chair, Green Committee and Associate Professor, at IIT Mandi told .  At IIT Madras, the campus has a fully-automated centralized 4 MLD-capacity Sewage Treatment Plant (SBR technology +UF + Ozonation) to treat 100 percent of the sewage generated. The treated sewage is recycled for flushing, gardening, cooling water for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and for the lake re-charging.The surplus treated sewage is being sold to IIT Madras Research Park.   The organic waste and biodegradable waste generated are composted using the composting facility and part of it is being treated using dome-type bio-digester. The compost generated are used as a soil conditioner for landscaping area. The recyclable solid wastes are sold to recyclers and local vendors while the dewatered STP sludge is being used as manure for gardening within the campus,  said Ligy Philip, Dean (Planning), IIT Madras.  Philip said every household in the campus has been provided with triple dustbins to segregate biodegradable and inorganic waste and an exclusive dustbin for sanitary waste disposal.  Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Director, IIT Madras, said,  We have installed the maximum possible solar panels on rooftops (around half of our daytime requirement). This directly reduces the consumption of thermal power by the same amount '.   We have around 45,000 tress on campus. But we have not calculated the amount of carbon they absorb and how much they compensate for our consumption of electricity from the grid and our use of fuel, which is quite low since students do not fuel-powered vehicles. Our students on campus have e-rickshaws and electric buses to reduce carbon footprint on campus,  he added.",

        "articleBody": "Tokyo 2020 will be the very first time in Olympic history that the Olympic cauldron will be powered with hydrogen, marking the Olympic Movement's commitment to a more sustainable world.Lighting the Olympic cauldron formally marks the end of the torch relay and symbolises the continuity between the ancient and modern Games. As climate change impacts our lives more and more, the hydrogen-powered cauldron shines new light on the opportunities for clean energy in Japan and across the planet. A light, storable and transportable gas which causes no emissions when produced with renewable energy, hydrogen may have a vital role to play in the transition to carbon-free societies. It currently offers some of the best potential to reduce or eliminate emissions from airlines, shipping and industry. As the world grapples to adapt to a heating planet, hydrogen is widely seen as a vital ingredient for a future that is climate-friendly and energy-efficient,  International Olympic Committee (IOC) stated in a release.With hydrogen's growing momentum in politics and business, Japan is showing the way forward to a hydrogen-based society. One of the first countries to adopt a national hydrogen strategy in 2017, it is giving hydrogen a starring role at Tokyo 2020. With their immense reach and visibility, the Olympic Games are a great opportunity to demonstrate technologies which can help tackle today's challenges, such as climate change,  said Marie Sallois in a release, Director for Corporate and Sustainable Development at the International Olympic Committee.  Tokyo 2020's showcasing of hydrogen is just one example of how these Games will contribute to this goal. Home to thousands of athletes for several weeks, the Olympic Village is one demonstration of how this technology can be used in practice. Built as a miniature hydrogen city, it shows the potential of a first full-scale hydrogen infrastructure. The hydrogen will also fuel athlete buses and heat water in the cafeterias, dormitories, and training facilities. After the Games, underground pipes will take hydrogen from a production station to residential blocks. Organisers hope the Olympic Village, as Japan's first full-scale hydrogen infrastructure, will leave an impression on future generations.Also, Japan is using the Olympic Games as an opportunity to accelerate the growth of its hydrogen ambitions. Under Japan's hydrogen vision, the country has set a target of 800,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2030 and a network of filling stations. There are currently 135 hydrogen refuelling stations in Japan, more than any other country.",

        "articleBody": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd's plans for investing Rs 75,000 crore in solar, batteries, fuel cells and hydrogen could create valuation of USD 36 billion (Rs 2.6 lakh crore) for the new energy business, Wall Street brokerage Bernstein Research said in a report.Reliance currently has three verticals -- oil-to-chemical (O2C) business that houses its oil refineries, petrochemical plants and fuel retailing business; digital services that comprises telecom arm Jio; and retail including e-commerce. New Energy will be the fourth vertical.At the company's annual general meeting of shareholders last month, Ambani announced a plan to invest Rs 75,000 crore in a new energy business over the next 3 years in the next stage in its transformation. Under plans announced, the company will invest across solar, batteries and hydrogen to create an integrated clean energy ecosystem.Other big announcements at the AGM were the launch of the new smartphone JioPhone Next and induction of Aramco chairman to the RIL Board, which is positive for the spin-off in O2C business. Clean energy has the potential to be value accretive if Reliance can pull it off,  it said.  Based on capex for clean energy, we see a route to Reliance building a clean energy business, which could be worth USD 36 billion. It put a valuation of over USD 69 billion for the O2C business, USD 66 billion for digital services and USD 81.2 billion for retail. Upstream oil and gas operations are worth another USD 4.1 billion. Other investments such as in the media and hospitality space are valued at USD 3.7 billion.The entire conglomerate is worth over USD 261 billion. Many oil companies have tried and failed to become clean energy manufacturing companies and instead focus on clean energy production. Reliance's focus on manufacturing is distinctive and potentially offers higher margins but is also higher risk given their limited capabilities in clean energy,  Bernstein said.Reliance will need to find partners to work with them given the technology requirements needed for fuel cells and batteries. While companies will be reluctant to share their technology with a potential competitor, the market opportunity in India may be enough to persuade some,  it said.  Korean battery makers could be potential partners in energy storage, while companies like Plug and Ballard could be partners in fuel cell manufacturing. Funding is not an issue for Reliance given the current balance sheet. Reliance is almost debt free and will generate cash flow of Rs 65,600 crore in FY22 and grow to Rs 1.5 lakh crore by FY26, it said.The logic of investing in clean energy is compelling. USD 70 trillion will be spent globally on the energy transition over the next 30 years.While India has yet to declare a net zero target, the direction towards low carbon is clear, it said adding with solar becoming cheaper than coal and hydrogen reaching cost parity with diesel, there are clear economic and energy security reasons to believe that India will transition towards clean energy.In this context it is also logical to assume that India will seek to develop technologies in manufacturing capacity given the huge investments which are needed.Bernstein said O2C margins continue to improve, raising hopes for Aramco investing in buying 20 per cent stake in the business. For FY22, we expect Reliance will deliver O2C EBITDA of Rs 52,200 crore (+90% y-o-y),  it said.  We remain optimistic that a deal will come together with Aramco albeit at a slightly lower valuation. At the time of announcing talks to sell stake to Aramco in 2019, Ambani had put USD 75 billion as the valuation of O2C business.Reliance will spend Rs 60,000 crore to construct four 'giga factories' to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries to store energy from the grid. The site of these plants will be located at the new 5,000 acres Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat. An additional Rs 15,000 crore will be used for investments across the value chain, technology, and partnerships for the new energy business.Ultimately, Reliance plans to offer a fully integrated end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to customers through solar, batteries and hydrogen.",

        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries' recent announcement of investments in low carbon energy could build a clean energy business worth $36 billion, Bernstein said in a note. At present, most clean energy companies trade at 2-3 times price-to-sales. Based on Reliance's capex plans for clean energy, the business may add Rs 395 per share to Reliance's stock, Bernstein said while upping its price target for the stock to Rs 2,830 from Rs 2,470.Bernstein said it expects the new energy business to contribute almost 10 per cent of the company's total Ebitda by FY26, assuming all the factories are constructed and ramped up on the company's timeline. This will make RIL a highly diversified conglomerate spanning E&P, refining, petrochemicals, clean energy, telecoms, retail and Internet, although we suspect the company will be split up given the inefficiency of such a corporate structure,  it said.Since it would require decades of investment in R&D to be successful organically, RIL would prefer partnerships with industry leaders in key technologies, it said, adding that this is  something which Reliance has been adept at doing. Bernstein said while key players will be reluctant to share technology with a potential competitor, the market opportunity in India may be enough to persuade some. Korean battery makers, it said, could be potential partners in energy storage while companies like Plug and Ballard could be partners in fuel cell manufacturing.It gave the example of China, which spent billions on fuel cell technology and ultimately ended up making investments in key companies such as Ballard Power to get better access to the best technology. Even companies with expertise in fuel cell manufacturing have acquired to enter the electrolyzer market. For energy storage, it is similarly impossible to imagine that Reliance could go it alone without assistance from a third party. For energy storage, the most obvious partners would be the Korean battery makers such as LG Chem, Samsung SDI or SKI. Reliance would certainly enable access to India, a potentially enormous market for these companies,  it said.The foreign brokerage suggested a few 'obvious' partners for hydrogen fuel cells. Ballard Power is an option and Ballard have partnered with WeiChai in China where they have built a Gigafactory in Shandong to develop fuel cells. Plug Power could be an alternative option, a company which has partnered with SK Innovation in the Korean market, where it is likely to set up a fuel cell and electrolyzer Gigafactory. On solid-state, Bloom Energy (who have also partnered with SKI in Korea) or Ceres Power, which licenses its technology to third parties, are both possible options,  it said.Bernstein said while it is unclear as to whether Reliance will be successful, it is too early to discount the company given its track record of successfully disrupting other industries, such as telecom and retail.Reliance has announced plans to spend $10 billion in capex on manufacturing plants to build solar PV panels, batteries, fuel cells and electrolyzers. Out of this, roughly $8 billion will be spent on manufacturing capacity and a further $2 billion will be spent investing across the value chain and technology.Bernstein said the split of the capex between each of the sub-sectors in unclear, but it suspects solar and PV would account for the bulk of the capex given the greater maturity of these industries.",

        "articleBody": "As India gets battered by Covid-19, keeping many away from their workplaces, one segment of its energy market is flourishing by cutting out labor-intensive tasks at some of the world\u2019s biggest refining complexes.When the virus pummeled the South Asian nation, operators of refineries and power generators were forced to postpone routine maintenance in order to avoid infections among the hundreds of technicians, engineers and general workers typically hired for such tasks. As they sought alternatives, some turned to technology and automation to bridge the gap.For Tarun Kumar Mishra, co-founder of Detect Technologies Pvt. Ltd., it was the perfect opportunity for his product: a real-time pipeline monitoring system that tracks leaks and corrosion using sensors and artificial intelligence. In 2014, tycoon Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd. made a rare $100,000 investment in Mishra, which helped fund the initiative.\u201cTechnology adoption increased substantially,\u201d Mishra said. \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak forced everyone to break the inertia of working with a certain process that\u2019s been in place for 50 to 60 years. They either had to shut down the plant or try a new way.\u201dForcing ChangeWith the funds, the 32-year-old Mishra said he roped in students who joined him with only food as an incentive. The company has since built another product utilizing drones programmed to inspect sites and equipment including refineries, power plants and reactors.The startup then won a contract from Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2019 to monitor a petrochemicals plant in Pennsylvania and now counts companies including Reliance and Bharat Petroleum Corp. in India, as well as global energy majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp. as customers.\u201cWe are benefiting from their drone-based monitoring of our plants and inspection of our tanks,\u201d said Arun Kumar Singh, director of marketing and refineries at Bharat Petroleum. \u201cThat\u2019s become all the more relevant right now as we are operating with a lesser number of people to avoid exposure.\u201dDetect is also working with Adani Transmission Ltd., which supplies electricity to India\u2019s financial hub of Mumbai, to avoid a repeat of a grid collapse last year that contributed to its worst blackout in decades. The company\u2019s other clients include Power Grid Corp. and the Tata Group.",

        "articleBody": "Seventy-two e-waste collection centres in the capital have been found violating E-waste Management Rules and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has been requested to take action against them, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said on Sunday.The degree of non-compliance is  very high  looking at the findings of the inspections, the DPCC noted.The apex pollution control body has also been asked to cancel Extended Producer's Responsibility (EPR) authorization granted to the producers attached with these non-compliant collection centres.EPR is one of the main features of E-waste Management Rules under which brand owners and importers are responsible for recovering the material placed in the market for safe disposal at their cost.These collection centres are required to comply with the CPCB guidelines regarding minimum area required for specified e-waste quantity, pollution control measures to be taken etc.The DPCC, being the state pollution control authority in Delhi, is required to carry out periodical inspections to ensure compliance of the terms and conditions laid down by the CPCB.Last week, the DPCC conducted inspections of the CPCB-authorised collection centres under EPR. Of the 83 collection centres inspected, 72 were found not complying with the rules, an official said. The CPCB is the competent authority to take action against such non-compliant collection centres. We have issued letters requesting it to cancel EPR authorization of the producers attached with these non-compliant collection centres,  the official said.Besides, 185 illegal e-waste handlers operating in residential areas have been closed down in over two years.The DPCC also said there is  certain slackness  in the implementation of the E-Waste Management Rules as proper awareness amongst stakeholders is not there.Though the DPCC has been issuing public notices for creation of awareness about the provisions and mandatory compliances from time to time, the degree of compliance is  far from satisfactory , it said.Majority of e-waste handling is happening in non-conforming areas of Delhi due to which control over them and compliance is lacking.E-Waste Management Rules, 2016 also stipulate that inventorisation of e-waste generation has to be done by the state pollution control board concerned.A committee consisting of officers of Ministry of Electronics, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, CPCB and DPCC has been constituted to finalise methodology to inventorise e-waste generation in Delhi.It is in the final stages of framing guidelines. Though the state boards of Madya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha have completed the inventorisation exercise, methodology stipulated by CPCB under the guidelines has not been followed, the DPCC said. Delhi will be the first state to complete this inventorisation exercise, if done as per the methodology of the CPCB,  it said.",

        "articleBody": "GAIL (India) Ltd will invest about Rs 5,000 crore to build a portfolio of at least 1 gigawatts of renewable energy and set up compressed biogas as well as ethanol plants as it steps up efforts to expand the business beyond natural gas. As part of a push to embrace cleaner forms of energy, GAIL will be laying pipeline infrastructure to connect consumption centers to gas sources and spend as much as Rs 4,000 crore on renewable energy, GAIL Chairman and Managing Director Manoj Jain said.   We are a business that is already eco-friendly - gas. And now we want to leverage our position to go greener in line with the vision of the government and the Prime Minister to cut carbon emissions and pollution,  he said.  While electricity generated from solar energy or through wind power is the cleanest form of energy, converting municipal waste into compressed biogas will supplement the availability of cleaner fuel to automobiles and households.  Also, it plans to set up ethanol units that can convert agriculture waste or sugarcane into less polluting fuel that can be doped in petrol, helping cut India's import dependence, he said.  While the renewable energy push would cost Rs 4,000 crore, setting up at least two compressed biogas plants and an ethanol factory would entail an investment of about Rs 800-1,000 crore, he said.  India, which imports 85 per cent of its crude oil needs, is stepping up efforts to explore new forms of energy to clean up the skies and reduce dependence on imported fuels.   We have 120 MW of renewable energy capacity which we want to scale up to 1GW in next 3-4 years,  he said.  GAIL will bid for a 400 MW solar power capacity being auctioned by SECI (formerly Solar Energy Corporation of India) in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.  The company had in 2019, won a bid for 874 MW operational wind power projects of IL&FS for Rs 4,800 crore. But IL&FS' other partners used the first right of refusal to block GAIL's bid, he said.   We are open to acquisitions and will look at any asset that makes commercial sense. We had almost got the IL&FS project,  he said.  GAIL has signed up with state-run power gear maker BHEL for renewable energy foray. The tie-up looks to leverage the competitive strengths of both companies. GAIL will be the project developer and BHEL will be a project manager and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor.  Jain said GAIL is setting up its first compressed biogas (CBG) plant in Ranchi at a cost of Rs 200-300 crore.  The facility will produce five tonnes of CBG per day and approximately 25 tonnes of bio-manure using municipal waste.   The gas produced will be fed into the city gas network supplying CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to households. This will help reduce pollution,  he said.  GAIL has floated an expression of interest (EoI) seeking partners for the setting up of CBG plants.  It also plans to set up an ethanol manufacturing unit, he said.  The move by GAIL, which commands a 75 per cent market share in gas transmission and more than 50 per cent share in gas trading in India, is seen as part of the government's vision to prepare for the energy transition process, under which the share of gas in the energy mix is sought to be raised to 15 per cent by 2030, from the current 6.2 per cent.  GAIL recently signed an agreement with Carbon Clean Solutions Ltd. Under this, CCSL will initially build four CBG plants using its own funding, technology, and expertise. These plants will be based on 10-year CBG offtake agreements with GAIL or its associated companies.  Depending on the success, the partnership will be scaled up to many more such plants.  GAIL owns and operates a network of 13,340 km of high-pressure trunk pipelines. In addition, it is working on multiple pipeline projects, aggregating over 7,500 km. It owns a petrochemical plant at Pata in Uttar Pradesh and is setting up a new one in Maharashtra .",

In a regulatory filing, the company informed that its board has approved expanding production capacity by 430-kilo litre per day to 1,400-kilo litre per day.  In February, the board had approved a capacity expansion of ethanol from 720-kilo litre per day to 970-kilo litre per day.   Considering the huge untapped demand for ethanol due to the policies of Government of India on ethanol blending, the Board of Directors of the company approved further capacity expansion for ethanol production from 970-kilo litre per day to 1,400-kilo litre per day,  the filing said.  The investment required for this capacity expansion is Rs 450 crore, it said. The capacity addition would be completed by October 2022.   The government of India has mandated 20% ethanol blending in fuel by 2025 against a current blending of 7.79 per cent. Considering this, the company sees a huge untapped demand for ethanol for the ethanol blending programme of the Government of India which can be of benefit to the company in the future,  Renuka Sugars said.  The company is one of the leading sugar companies in India.",

        "articleBody": "The government will take a decision over flex-fuel engines in the next 8-10 days as it is considering making these engines mandatory for the automobile industry, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Sunday while asserting that the move will help farmers and boost the Indian economy. Addressing Rotary District Conference 2020-21 virtually, Gadkari said that the price of alternative fuel ethanol is Rs 60-62 per litre while petrol costs more than Rs 100 per litre in many parts of the country, so by using ethanol, Indians will save Rs 30-35 per litre.  I am transport minister, I am going to issue an order to the industry, that only petrol engines will not be there, there will be flex-fuel engines, where there will be choice for the people that they can use 100 per cent crude oil or 100 per ethanol,  he said.  I am going to take a decision within 8-10 days and we will make it (flex-fuel engine) mandatory for the automobile industry,  he further said. The Road Transport and Highways Minister mentioned that automobile makers are producing flex-fuel engines in Brazil, Canada and the US providing an alternative to customers to use 100 per cent petrol or 100 per cent bio-ethanol. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the target date for achieving 20 per cent ethanol-blending with petrol has been advanced by five years to 2025 to cut pollution and reduce import dependence. The government last year had set a target of reaching 10 per cent ethanol blending in petrol by 2022 and 20 per cent doping by 2030. Currently, about 8.5 per cent ethanol is mixed with petrol as against 1-1.5 per cent in 2014, Gadkari said adding ethanol procurement has risen from 38 crore litres to 320 crore litres. Gadkari said that ethanol is a better fuel than petrol, and it is import substitute, cost effective, pollution-free and indigenous.  It (making flex-fuel engines mandatory) is going to boost the Indian economy because we are a corn surplus, we are a sugar surplus, and a wheat surplus country. We don't have places to stock all these foodgrains,  he noted. Noting that the surplus of foodgrains is creating problems, he said,  Our minimum support prices (MSP) of crops is higher than international prices and domestic market prices, so the government has taken the decision that you can make ethanol by using foodgrain and sugarcane juice.  Petrol price in the national capital crossed Rs 97 a litre and diesel neared Rs 88 after fuel prices were raised yet again. The hike on Sunday was the 27th increase in prices since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended a 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal. In 27 hikes, petrol price has risen by Rs 6.82 per litre and diesel by Rs 7.24 a litre International oil prices have firmed up in recent weeks in anticipation of demand recovery following the rollout of vaccination programme by various countries. Also, the rupee has weakened against the US dollar, making imports costlier.",

Conquering the fuel requirement at such high altitude / low temperature and duly backed by robust quality checks, HPCL has become the first oil marketing company in the country to launch ethanol-blended petrol in Ladakh region,  it said. The government has mandated oil companies to mix ethanol in petrol to help cut emissions and reduce oil import bill. A target of mixing 20 per cent ethanol in petrol has been set for 2025.  HPCL's Leh depot, which was commissioned in 2018 with total tankage of 4,450 kilolitres, is a crucial oil depot in the northernmost part of the country as it caters to the local demand and requirements of the Indian Armed Forces deployed along the borders.  The depot has enough capacity to cater to the entire region during the harsh winter months when supply to the region is not possible due to road blockages.  HPCL was also the first oil marketing company of the country to start selling ethanol-blended petrol from its retail outlets situated in the Jammu and Kashmir region,  the statement said.  Stating that ethanol has become one of the major priorities of 21st century India, HPCL said the focus on ethanol is helping the cause of a better environment and is also bringing in a positive impact on the lives of farmers.  These initiatives of HPCL will boost the efforts of our country in achieving the target of 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol by 2025,  the statement added.",

        "articleBody": "Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said India is going to increase the production of alternative fuel ethanol as people are facing problems due to a rise in the prices of petrol and diesel. Addressing a conference organised by BRICS Network University virtually, Gadkari mentioned that automobile makers are producing flex-fuel engines in Brazil, Canada and the US providing an alternative to customers to use 100 per cent petrol or 100 per cent bio-ethanol.  Now Indian production (of ethanol) we are going to increase because of the rise in petrol price, people are facing a lot of problems,  Gadkari said while explaining that the use of ethanol is cost effective. Petrol prices in some parts of the country, including metro cities Mumbai and Hyderabad, have crossed Rs 100 per litre mark due to multiple fuel price hikes in past six weeks. Petrol retails at over Rs 100 per litre mark in seven states and union territories -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Ladakh. Gadkari pointed out that the ethanol price will be Rs 60-62 per litre and petrol price is more than Rs 100 per litre.  As far as caloric value of ethanol is concerned, the 750 ml of petrol or 800 ml is equal to 1 litre of ethanol, still there is Rs 20 saving per litre,  the road transport and highways minister said.  And it is an import substitute and cost effective, pollution free and indigenous,  he added. The minister pointed out that for all the racing cars, all over the world ethanol is used as fuel. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the target date for achieving 20 per cent ethanol-blending with petrol has been advanced by five years to 2025 to cut pollution and reduce import dependence. The government last year had set a target of reaching 10 per cent ethanol blending in petrol by 2022 and 20 per cent doping by 2030. Currently, about 8.5 per cent ethanol is mixed with petrol as against 1-1.5 per cent in 2014, Gadkari said adding ethanol procurement has risen from 38 crore litres to 320 crore litres. Highlighting the need for a policy for import substitution, the minister said India imports Rs 8 lakh crores of crude oil, and this will rise two-folds in the next 4-5 years which would have a huge impact on the economy. Gadkari said India's minimum support price (MSP) for some crops are higher than international prices that is why the government allowing ethanol production from sugarcane, foodgrains and corn.  We will make ethanol economy of Rs 2 lakh crore in the next five years,  he said. Ethanol extracted from sugarcane as well as damaged food grains such as wheat and broken rice and agriculture waste is less polluting and its use also provides farmers with an alternate source of income. The minister also mentioned that the government is working to support electric vehicle (EV) industry, and American electric car major Tesla is going to enter the Indian market soon. The government has facilitated sale of 2-3 wheeler EVs, he said, adding that the  government is giving permissions to start petrol pumps, which will also have EV charging infrastructure . He also said that the indigenous battery technology will make electric vehicle (EV) most efficient means of transportation and the country aims to shift public transport on electricity. He also said that the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is 60 per cent complete.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The World Bank Friday approved a $1.5 billion loan to help India accelerate low-carbon energy development by promoting a market for green hydrogen as well as electrolysers and renewable energy penetration. The green financing will allow the country to scale up renewable energy and encourage finance for low-carbon energy investments, said World Bank India country director Auguste Tano Kouame. The bank's board of executive directors approved the second tranche of financing to support the country's low-carbon transition on Friday. The Indian economy is expected to continue to expand at a rapid pace and decoupling this from rising emissions will require scaling up renewable energy, as per the bank.111349537Focus on Energy Efficiency The goal of the latest programme is to provide financing to support the government's policies and regulations that the government is putting in place to stimulate investment in energy transition, especially in green hydrogen and renewable energy, Kouame said.  Our financing (operation) is less about directly providing money to the projects and more about providing support for advancing introduction of policies and regulations and technical assistance to the design of these interventions,  he said.The next step is to help the government mobilise more financing in the energy space with a focus on the private sector, he said. Beyond funding, the bank's energy programs will continue to look at renewable energy generation, especially offshore wind and floating solar. It will also look at energy efficiency and work with the government to make systems more efficient, such as green buildings.The World Bank's programme in renewable energy is also aimed at helping integrate it into the grid, he said. The grid code should be amended to facilitate incorporation of higher proportion of renewable energy, he added. The latest programme envisaged further green energy penetration through incentivising battery energy storage solutions that are required for round-the-clock clean power.",

Under the agreement, SJVN Green Energy Limited (SGEL) will supply 4,500 MW of carbon-free energy to AM Green\u2019s upcoming green ammonia facilities. SGEL will set up this capacity through solar and wind power, while AM Green will integrate it with pumped hydro storage to ensure a steady supply of green energy to AM Green facilities.SJVN plans to execute the project in three phases, with the first phase delivering 1,500 MW within two years. This initiative is a major milestone for SJVN's renewable energy expansion in India, supporting its goal of reaching 25,000 MW by 2030 and 50,000 MW by 2040, the company said in a press statement.AM Green, promoted by the founders of Greenko, targets to produce 5 million tons per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia by 2030, equivalent to about 1 MTPA of green hydrogen. This represents a fifth of India\u2019s target for green hydrogen production under the country\u2019s National Green Hydrogen Mission and 10% of Europe\u2019s target for green hydrogen imports by 2030. Mahesh Kolli, Founder, Greenko Group & AM Green said,  This partnership demonstrates AM Green\u2019s emerging leadership position as a global clean energy transition solutions platform while contributing to India\u2019s ambition of emerging as an exporter of reliable, sustainable and lowest-cost green molecules and its derivatives accelerating industrial decarbonisation globally.\u201d  Ajay Singh, CEO, SJVN Green, said that the project marks SJVN\u2019s foray into supplying power to private sector entities.\u201dIn October 2023, Gentari Sdn Bhd, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Gentari International Renewables Pte Ltd, signed an agreement with AM Green to jointly invest in phases in AM Green Ammonia Holdings BV (AMG Ammonia). Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, is also an investor in AMG Ammonia.AM Green has a strong pipeline of power offtake agreements, including NTPC Renewables and Gentari, to support its green hydrogen ambitions. With these agreements, AM Green is on a fast track for a final investment decision (FID) for its first 2 MTPA green ammonia project early this year, positioning itself ahead of other companies aiming for green ammonia capacity in India and globally, the company said.",

        "description": "Maruti Suzuki India saw a nearly 7% surge in its stock price following Uttar Pradesh's decision to waive registration levies on strong hybrid and plug-in vehicles. This move, aimed at promoting greener mobility choices alongside electric cars, is expected to reduce ownership costs by 10%. Maruti, already a leader in the strong hybrid category, stands to benefit significantly. This policy shift reflects a broader trend among states to incentivize alternative technologies like biofuels and hybrids, aiming to make them more attractive and cost-effective compared to traditional petrol vehicles.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki India surged nearly 7% Tuesday after Uttar Pradesh, the second-biggest sub-national market for cars, waived registration levies on strong hybrid and plug-in vehicles in a decision the company's chairman described as only a 'start' in the nation's journey toward promoting greener mobility choices besides pure electric cars. The start has been made. I will be surprised if it stops there,  RC Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India, told ET.  This is the first instance of a state government not only recognising the need but also taking a concrete step toward promoting alternative technologies. This will have implications on future policies. Maruti was the biggest gainer on the Nifty, climbing 6.5% to \u20b912,807 apiece. The move is expected to reduce the cost of ownership of such vehicles by 10%. Maruti Suzuki, the country's biggest carmaker by unit sales, holds an advantage in the strong hybrid category over its peers.West Bengal also recently reduced the registration fees the state levies on CNG vehicles. Moves by these states should also help promote investments in alternative and intermediate technologies such as biofuel, ethanol and hybrids in a more cost-effective manner.  Currently, electric vehicles (EVs) in India are taxed at only 5%, whereas hybrids are taxed as high as 43%, just below the 48% tax imposed on petrol cars.For cars priced above \u20b910 lakh, Uttar Pradesh levied a registration charge equivalent to 10% of the ex-showroom prices of a model. Starting July 1, these charges have been waived, said the sales manager at a Noida-based showroom of Maruti. 111615247Uttar Pradesh levies an 8% registration charge on vehicles priced up to \u20b910 lakh, and 10% beyond this threshold. The state accounts for nearly 10% of India's total passenger vehicle (PV) market and is the largest PV market after Maharashtra.Still, sales of strong hybrid PVs in UP were only 853 units in the first quarter of FY25, constituting 0.6% of the state's total PV sales volumes, according to Vahan data. More than a dozen states offer some form of waivers on strong hybrid vehicles, albeit with eligibility caps.A 10% waiver leads to an effective price reduction of \u20b91.5 lakh to \u20b93 lakh (depending on the model and variant). Price Gap? No Longer The reduction contracts the price gap between comparable petrol models and hybrids, making the latter more attractive,  said Puneet Gupta, director of S&P Global Automotive.According to Bhargava, while no one can question the premise of reducing carbon emissions and cutting fuel import bills and EVs have been chosen for the purpose, EVs can't do the job alone.  Even in the best-case scenario, EV penetration is likely to be around 40% by 2034. The remaining 60% will still be non-electric vehicles and their volumes will be much higher than what it is today. Hybrids can be a good substitute for ICE and can help reduce the fuel import bill by a third,  he said.The reduction in registration costs will lower the acquisition prices of Maruti's strong hybrid vehicles such as the Grand Vitara and Invicto by \u20b92 lakh and \u20b93 lakh, respectively. It will reduce the break-even price for transitioning from conventional petrol vehicles to strong hybrids, accelerating their adoption.Strong hybrid vehicles generally command higher average selling prices and better pricing power. Thus, having a greater share of such vehicles in its sales mix should help expand margins at Maruti.Maruti-Toyota ComboCurrently, there are only five strong hybrid models available in the market, two of which are offered by Maruti Suzuki. Those models are also cross-badged by Toyota under different names. Honda City, meanwhile, is the only strong hybrid variant outside of the Toyota-Maruti arrangement.Maruti holds a market share of 44.6% in UP compared with 41.7% nationally. An increase in conversions from petrol to hybrids would further bolster its position in the state. Analysts expect a 7% volume growth for FY25, with total volumes to reach 2.29 million units.Strong hybrids are equipped with a combustion engine and an electric motor and they can either work together or independently based on driving conditions. During low-speed driving, the motor can power the car while the engine takes over during high-speed driving.This is unlike mild hybrid cars where the electric motor is not powerful enough to drive the car solely but provides intermittent bursts of energy when required. In the case of plug-in hybrids, the motor is the main power source while the combustion engine takes over when the battery discharges.",

        "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Over half the eight companies that won bids in January for electrolyser manufacturing under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, have conveyed to the government that they will be able to commission their units by next year, ahead of the 2026 deadline, said people aware of the development.This will be a boost to India's green ambitions as electrolysers are essential for green hydrogen production.John Cockerill Greenko Hydrogen, L&T Electrolysers, Reliance Electrolyser Manufacturing and Adani New Industries see their manufacturing units ready by 2025. Most of the allottees will be able to commission their facilities much ahead of the deadline and have conveyed this to the government,  said a senior government official. Jindal India, Ohmium Operations, Advait Infratech and homiHydrogen are others that won bids.Companies mentioned above didn't respond to queries.Electrolysers split water into oxygen and hydrogen using electricity - a process known as electrolysis. Green hydrogen is a gas made by electrolysers using power from renewable energy sources and is essential for decarbonising industries.Currently, India is reliant on the global market to source electrolysers for its green hydrogen projects. To counter this, as well as reduce the cost of green hydrogen production, the Solar Energy Corporation of India, in July 2023, issued a request for selection of electrolyser manufacturers to set up 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.Prior Tie-upsIndustry players said the current price of an electrolyser in the global market is $600 (Rs 50,000) per kilowatt (kW). Through the PLI scheme, this price will be brought down to $564-570 (Rs 47,000) in India. However, an electrolyser in China is still cheaper at $400 (Rs 33,000) per kW. Electrolyser manufacturers are projected to achieve a 7-10% reduction in total system costs for the first five years, with Rs 2,960/kW ($36/kW) being the average annual realisable base incentive,  according to a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. 111615502 Most of us who won the bids had prior tie-ups with electrolyser technology companies,  said an executive at one of the participating companies.  Some had even secured technology licence agreements before participating in the tender, so we will be able to launch our electrolysers before the deadline. While Greenko partnered with John Cockerill, a global leader in electrolyser manufacturing, Reliance Industries partnered with Danish company Stiesdal for the development and manufacturing of hydrogen electrolysers. Reliance has also entered into a technology licensing agreement with Norway's Nel ASA for its alkaline electrolysers in India.L&T commissioned its first indigenously manufactured hydrogen electrolyser at the green hydrogen plant in Hazira, Gujarat on March 1. With a power capacity of 1 MW (expandable to 2 MW), the electrolyser is equipped with two stacks and an electrolyser processing unit that's indigenously manufactured and assembled. The company used alkaline electrolyser technology from McPhy Energy, France.Adani New Industries has tied up with multiple technology partners to build its facility. Ohmium has been operating an electrolyser manufacturing plant since 2021.  With lower cost of electrolysers and India's low-cost renewable electricity, India's green hydrogen production could become competitive with other fuels,  said the company official cited above.",
