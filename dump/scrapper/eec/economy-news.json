            "articleBody": "LONDON: China's economy has become much less energy intensive over the last 40 years as its industries have modernised and the economy has shifted towards more service sector output. But energy intensity has flatlined for the last five years making it much harder to displace coal by renewables and meet the government's objective of capping total emissions. China converted 1 tonne of standard coal or its equivalent in other forms of energy (including wind and solar generation) into gross domestic product worth 21,000 yuan in 2023. Conversion of energy into economic output was essentially no more efficient than in 2018, after adjusting for inflation, according to estimates prepared by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Energy consumption has roughly tracked economic growth, rather than declining in relation to output as in other major economies.  No other country has been more active than China in deploying huge amounts of wind and solar generation in the last few years. Hydro, wind, solar and nuclear generation supplied 17.5 per cent of total energy consumption in 2022 up from 13.6 per cent in 2017. Most of the gains have come at the expense of coal, which supplied 56 per cent of total energy consumption down from 61 per cent in 2017. But economic output and energy consumption are growing so fast a smaller share has translated into more absolute use. Unless China boosts efficiency, most extra renewables will be used to meet increasing energy requirements rather than replace coal in the next few years. IMPROVEMENT STALLS Before 2018, China achieved large and consistent annual reductions in energy intensity as heavy industries modernised and the economy's composition shifted from energy-intensive manufacturing to less energy-intensive services. The share of energy-intensive primary and secondary industries in total economic output fell to 47 per cent in 2017 down from 57 per cent in 2007 and 65 per cent in 1997. The corresponding share of less energy-intensive services rose to 53 per cent in 2017 from 43 per cent in 2007 and 35 per cent in 1997 (\"China Statistical Yearbook\", NBS, 2023). Some of the improvement in energy efficiency before 2018 was therefore more apparent than real, reflecting a change in the composition of output rather than better equipment and practices. Since 2018, however, there has been no further movement away from manufacturing and towards the services sector. Some of the stagnation likely reflects the impact of the coronavirus epidemic and the movement controls imposed in response. Lockdowns and other social distancing measures hit personal services such as food, travel and entertainment particularly hard. At the same time, the bursting of China's real estate bubble has hit a broad range of services linked to moving home and refurbishing. In response, the government has focused on stimulating manufacturing to offset weakness in other parts of the economy and reduce dependence on imports from the United States and its allies. The result is that the composition of the economy has become more not less energy intensive, offsetting any underlying efficiency improvements.  REGAINING MOMENTUM? Some of these changes are likely to prove temporary, especially those associated with the pandemic, while others may be permanent, including the focus on new industries and reducing reliance on imported technology. If the economy resumes its gradual shift towards services, which seems likely as the pandemic effects wane, energy intensity will fall and apparent efficiency will rise again in the next few years. But to the extent the focus on new industries, including electric vehicles, batteries and solar manufacturing, is permanent, there will be a structural increase in intensity and corresponding fall in apparent efficiency. The focus on building new industries, indigenising the supply chain to reduce reliance on imported technology from the United States and its allies and boosting manufacturing exports have all resulted in higher energy consumption and pushed back the timeline for cutting coal consumption and emissions.By John Kemp",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI/ WASHINGTON: The World Bank on Tuesday retained India's growth forecast at 6.3 per cent for current financial year on the back of robust services activities despite global headwinds.According to a World Bank report released on Tuesday, India continues to show resilience against the backdrop of a challenging global environment.In India, which accounts for the bulk of South Asia region, growth is expected to remain robust at 6.3 per cent in 2023-24, India Development Update of the World Bank said.The World Bank had projected 6.3 per cent GDP growth in its April report as well. India recorded 7.2 per cent growth in 2022-23.Last month, Asian Development Bank (ADB) marginally lowered India's growth forecast to 6.3 per cent for current financial year.As per RBI's latest forecast, the Indian economy would grow at 6.5 per cent in 2023-24.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in its latest report upped the GDP growth projection for India to 6.3 per cent from the previous estimate of 6 per cent.While global rating agency Fitch retained India's growth forecast at 6.3 per cent, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence raised it to 6.6 per cent from the earlier projection of 5.9 per cent.Sharing sectoral growth projections, the World Bank report said, the agriculture sector is expected to clock a growth of 3.5 per cent, industry 5.7 per cent and services 7.4 per cent during 2023-24. At the same time, investment growth is projected to remain robust at 8.9 per cent.\"An adverse global environment will continue to pose challenges in the short term. Tapping public spending that crowds in more private investments will create more favourable conditions for India to seize global opportunities in the future and thus achieve higher growth,\" said Auguste Tano Kouame, World Bank's Country Director in India.On inflation, the report said, it is expected to decrease gradually as food prices normalize and government measures help increase the supply of key commodities.Retail inflation is expected to remain elevated at 5.9 per cent during the year, it said.The World Bank expects fiscal consolidation to continue in FY24 with the central government's fiscal deficit projected to decline from 6.4 per cent to 5.9 per cent of GDP.\"Public debt is expected to stabilize at 83 per cent of GDP. On the external front, the current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.4 per cent of GDP, and it will be adequately financed by foreign investment flows and supported by large foreign reserves,\" it said.The report also said the asset quality of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) continue to improve, driven by higher loan growth, decline in slippages, better recoveries and write-offs of bad loans.Gross non-performing assets of SCBs as a ratio of gross advances reached its lowest level in a decade to 3.9 per cent as of March 2023 compared to 5.9 per cent in March 2022, it said.The World Bank said South Asia is expected to grow 5.8 per cent this year&mdash;higher than any other developing country region in the world, but slower than its pre-pandemic pace and not fast enough to meet its development goals.As compared to the earlier forecast, growth in 2023 has been upgraded by 0.2 percentage points due to stronger-than-expected data in India.\"At first glance, South Asia is a bright spot in the global economy. The World Bank is forecasting that the region will grow more quickly than any other developing country region over the next few years,\" said Martin Raiser, vice president, South Asia Region, World Bank.Although India's post-pandemic economic rebound is now fading, growth is expected to remain stronger than in other large emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Output is forecast to grow 6.3 per cent in FY2023-24 and 6.4 per cent in FY2024-25&mdash; roughly equal to the estimated pace of India's potential growth, the World Bank said.\"The dampening effect of monetary policy tightening on domestic demand, particularly investment, will likely peak in the coming year. The effects of slowing global demand and rising interest rates will be mitigated by India's low external debt and the healthy balance sheets of its financial and corporate sectors,\" the bank said in its report.Growth of merchandise exports is expected to slow as a result of weak foreign demand growth, although this will be offset by robust services exports.The World Bank said, in India, robust output growth in the first half of 2023 was supported by a strong expansion of investment and, on a sectoral level, continued strength of services.Government infrastructure projects have supported momentum in the construction sector, which has grown at year-over-year rates of around 10 per cent in recent quarters.\"Export growth has benefited from strong exports of services, such as those related to information technology and consulting, which have been little affected by the slowdown in global growth. India's services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reached 62.3 in August, nearly 10 points above the global index,\" the bank said.Employment indicators have been weaker, however, suggesting that with appropriate policies, the country's economic growth could deliver more robust job creation, it said.In India, inflation was trending below the upper bound of the inflation target range before a disruptive monsoon caused a substantial recent increase in food prices, the report noted.To counter this, the government has implemented an export ban on most types of rice. The Reserve Bank of India increased interest rates substantially last year, and has kept them steady since this February.According to the bank, in India, the financial sector has shown few signs of strain. Bank balance sheets and corporate leverage ratios have improved substantially in recent years.The current account deficit has been predominantly financed by foreign portfolio investment and remittances. Foreign exchange reserves are at a healthy level, while the currency has alternated between periods of stability and mild depreciation. Non-performing loans in the banking sector are low. ",

            "articleBody": "In addition to the economy, companies in various sectors such as paints, tyres, oil, cement, and aviation also feel the direct pain of rising prices as crude is a key raw material for many of them. Rising crude prices tends to be bad news for India as it has always weighed down on the economy in the past. With Brent crude futures at about USD 95 a barrel due to supply cuts by oil producing countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia, market participants have begun evaluating its impact with the country importing more than 80% of its oil needs. In addition to the economy, companies in various sectors such as paints, tyres, oil, cement, and aviation also feel the direct pain of rising prices as crude is a key raw material for many of them. ET looks at the impact of rising crude prices on these sectors and stock prices:Oil Marketing Cos (OMCs)Analysts see profitability of oil refining and marketing companies getting squeezed on account of the firming crude oil prices.\"Since gross margins are lower in diesel and petrol, bleeding in OMCs is expected to continue,\" said Swarnendu Bhushan, co-head of research at Prabhudas Liladher. \"In OMCs, the refining margins are strong, but the marketing margins are lower. If the crude oil prices remain above USD 90 post the second quarter, then margin downgrades can occur.\"OMC shares will remain subdued, and the underperformance will continue. \"ONGC, GAIL and Gujarat Gas are some stocks that can withstand the pressure from rising crude prices,\" said Bhushan.    PaintsPaint companies are likely to witness earnings downgrades, given the industry's heavy dependence on oil derivatives. \"About 60-65% of the total raw material cost of paint can be attributed to crude oil derivatives,\" said G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research. He said market leaders might be able to withstand the cost pressure, but the overall impact will be negative. The foray of Grasim Industries into the paints business could put further pressure on margins.\"This industry will see a major impact also because its growth in the last couple of years has not been in double digits. The increase in raw material cost will pinch them.\" he said.TyreSince crude is a significant component in manufacturing of tyres, higher crude prices are expected to impact tyre stocks negatively. \"Crude is used for producing synthetic rubber and carbon black, which collectively contribute to more than 30% of the total raw material costs of tyres,\" said Ashwin Patil, senior research analyst at LKP Securities. He said that increasing operating leverage from demand for autos, particularly in PVs and two-wheelers may offset part of the margin pressure though.Investors will, however, do better by remaining selective about shares of tyre makers in the wake of elevated crude prices. \"Stocks like MRF, Apollo and CEAT, which are strong players in personal vehicles (PV) and two-wheelers in the listed space should get slight advantage over those who are strong in commercial vehicle (CV) and tractors space which are now in a slow lane and are expected to post lower growth this fiscal,\" said Patil.AviationThe airline industry has been one of the most impacted among various sectors by rising oil prices. Aviation turbine fuel (ATFs) makes up for over 40% of airlines' operating costs. Brokerage Emkay Global said OMCs have hike domestic ATF prices in September by 14% from last month. The firm said recovering yields on account of the upcoming holiday season could help partly offset fuel cost pressures. But, a weakening rupee could lead to forex losses for aviation companies in the September quarter. Chokkalingam said market leaders like IndiGo may be able to withstand the pressure better, though earnings will remain weak.",

            "articleBody": "Frankfurt: Construction work has started on the long-delayed 700-kilometre (430-mile) power line that will transfer wind-generated electricity from northern to southern Germany, the economy ministry said Monday, pushed by an energy crisis.The underground line, SuedLink, is vital for the energy transition as northern Germany has more wind farms than the south, where officials have faced criticism for dragging their feet on building turbines.In fact, the power line had been due to begin operation in 2022, but works had been held up because of strong opposition from the south, particularly in Bavaria.An energy crisis sparked by Russia's war on Ukraine had finally forced southern states to relent.Construction of the 10-billion-euro ($10.7 billion) project will finally begin with work on a tunnel under the River Elbe, in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein, the ministry said in a statement.The line will transfer power to the affluent, energy-hungry southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. Scheduled for completion in 2028, the line will have a total transmission capacity of four gigawatts -- enough power for about 10 million households.\"With the SuedLink, southern Germany will in future be able to benefit from the large quantity of wind power generated in the north,\" said Economy Minister Robert Habeck.\"This will strengthen (energy security) in Germany, and also neighbouring countries.\"Habeck, of the ecologist Green party, added the start of construction was \"good news\" for the energy transition.In addition, a major power cable running between northern Germany and Denmark to the north was nearing completion, and is scheduled to be finished next year, the ministry said. This line will improve the transfer of electricity from regions of Denmark that produce wind power, and strengthen the European grid, it said. As part of efforts to fight climate change, Europe's biggest economy is aiming to become carbon neutral by 2045, and has pledged to produce 80 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.Germany is in dire need of extra sources of power -- it recently shut down its last nuclear plant and plans to close its final coal-fired power stations in the coming years.But a study by the German Wind Energy Association released in July showed that, while the country had made progress in expanding onshore wind power capacity, more work is needed to meet key targets. There has been political resistance to turbines from local communities concerned they could be a blight on the landscape, particularly in southern Germany, meaning far more permits have been issued in the north.

Saudi Arabia is widely expected to extend voluntary oil cuts into October and Russia will unveil a new OPEC+ supply cut deal this week, according to its deputy prime minister.  \"Data released last week showed that increasing exports from Iran and Nigeria are being offset by falls in Saudi Arabian output,\" ANZ Research said in a note, adding that news from Russia also helped ease concerns of increasing supply elsewhere.  On the downside, markets have overall priced in China's recent measures to boost the country's faltering economy, offsetting support from the expected oil supply cuts.  In Japan, the world's third biggest economy, household spending in July fell 5.0 per cent from a year earlier, deeper than a forecast decline of 2.5 per cent and continuing into a fifth month of falls.",

The Qatari bencmark dropped 0.4 per cent, as most of the stocks in the index were in negative territory including Isalmic lender Masraf A Rayan, which was down 1.6 per cent.

            "articleBody": "London: British energy giant BP on Tuesday announced a drop in second-quarter net profit as oil and gas prices retreated from peaks reached a year earlier following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Profit after tax plunged to $1.8 billion in the three months to the end of June compared with $9.3 billion in the second quarter last year, BP said in a statement, mirroring hefty falls across the sector. \"Our financial performance is impacted by fluctuating prices of oil, gas and refined products,\" it added. Energy prices soared a year ago following the Ukraine invasion by key producer Russia, sending global inflation to the highest levels in decades while providing record profits for oil and gas companies.  Russia cut gas shipments to Europe while oil markets were also rocked by supply concerns. Gas and oil prices have since pulled back but remain at elevated levels.  - Shareholder rewards - Despite the slump in profits, BP said it was hiking its dividend and returning $1.5 billion to shareholders by repurchasing stock. \"This reflects confidence in our performance and the outlook for cash flow,\" chief executive Bernard Looney said in the earnings statement. BP's share price advanced 1.9 percent in early London trading following the earnings update. \"BP's move to boost shareholder returns is in line with moves by some of the other leading oil producers as they focus on ensuring investors benefit from the strength of cash flow the industry is currently enjoying,\" said Steve Clayton, head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown. Natural gas prices have pulled back sharply as European countries found new suppliers, built up reserves and experienced a mild winter. Oil prices have also tumbled, partly on fears of falling demand as the global economy slows, with major consumer China's post-Covid recovery stumbling. Profits remain hefty, however, as oil and gas firms stay focused on pumping out fossil fuels while pivoting toward cleaner energy. The UK government said Monday that it would issue \"hundreds\" of new oil and gas licences in the North Sea to secure energy reserves while still aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The announcement has angered environmental groups. \"Handing out new oil and gas licences will do nothing to improve our energy security,\" Charlie Kronick, senior climate advisor at Greenpeace UK, said Tuesday. He added in a statement that it would instead allow \"companies like BP and Shell to rake in even more money for their shareholders\".",

            "articleBody": "Former EU member Britain has the most far-reaching short-term emissions target of any major economy, pledging 78 percent cuts from 1990 levels by 2035.Despite their 2015 pledge to limit global warming by slashing carbon emissions, big countries' commitments so far still fall short of meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement, monitors say. After EU lawmakers adopted sweeping climate measures on Tuesday, here is a roundup of where it and other major carbon emitters stand. Many countries have committed to achieving carbon neutrality -- where any remaining emissions will be sequestered or offset -- by the second half of this century. But monitoring site Carbon Action Tracker (CAT) rates many of these plans as lacking in detail. The 2015 Paris accord requires \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) from countries to meet the global aim of limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels -- a target since tightened to 1.5C.  - China - China is by far the largest emitter, responsible for roughly a quarter of all carbon pollution currently and 14 percent since the start of industrial times. In the medium term, it has promised to reduce the intensity of its emissions by as much as 65 percent by 2030 and peak emissions at the end of this decade. More than half China's energy comes from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. But it is also a leading producer of solar panels and electric vehicles. Beijing says it has already halved its carbon intensity (emissions as a proportion of GDP) since 2005. Aiming for carbon neutrality by 2060, its targets are judged insufficient by CAT.  - United States - The US is the world's second-largest polluter currently but the biggest historically, responsible for 25 percent of emissions during the industrial era, according to the Global Carbon Project. President Joe Biden rejoined the Paris accord after his predecessor Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of it. Biden has set a net-zero date for 2050 and in 2022 passed the USD 370 billion \"Inflation Reduction Act\", containing a host of measures to promote low-carbon energy. In the medium term, Biden aims to halve US emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Monitoring site Paris Equity Check said that would still lead to warming of 3.4C if all countries reduced emissions at a comparable rate. The US is still heavily invested in fossil fuels. Despite Biden's reform, he approved a new oil-drilling project in Alaska, outraging environmentalists.  - Europe - The 27-nation European Union is collectively the third biggest global emitter of carbon dioxide. It aims to cut carbon emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. That corresponds to 2.5C of warming at a global rate, says Paris Equity Check. CAT judges the commitments \"almost sufficient\". On April 18, 2023 the EU adopted emissions measures including a carbon border tax on imports. Under the legislation, European Union carbon emissions are to be cut 62 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels -- up from a previous target of 43 percent. Germany, the EU's largest economy, has more ambitious targets, pledging to slash emissions 65 percent by 2030 from 1990 levels. France aims to reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 and is expected to update its targets soon to meet EU goals. Former EU member Britain has the most far-reaching short-term emissions target of any major economy, pledging 78 percent cuts from 1990 levels by 2035.  - India - Like China, India plans to reduce its carbon intensity -- by up to 45 percent this decade compared to 2005 levels. It aims for carbon neutrality by 2070. CAT says how India plans to achieve this is unclear. The world's third-largest polluter -- and now its most populous country -- continues to expand coal power but renewable energy there is also growing.  - Russia - Russia formally joined the Paris deal in 2019.  Moscow has said it plans to cut emissions 30 percent by 2030 from 1990 levels. Its commitments are \"critically insufficient\" according to monitor CAT.  - Japan - The world's third-biggest economy and heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels, Japan has said it aims for a 46-percent reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2013 levels. That would yield 2C of warming at a global rate, according to CAT. To get there, the government wants to restart more of the nuclear reactors that were taken offline after the 2011 Fukushima meltdown. Around a third are already back in action. Campaigners criticise Japan's continued overseas fossil fuel investments. Oil Change International says the country spent an annual average of USD 6.9 billion on new gas, coal and oil projects in 2020-22.  - Brazil - Among other major emitters, Brazil aims to halve emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. But it also has plans to expand emissions from oil and gas and has not yet succeeded in curbing deforestation of the Amazon -- a critical absorber of carbon.",

The offshore Kashagan field, one of the biggest discoveries in recent decades, is being developed by Eni, Shell , TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, KazMunayGas, Inpex and CNPC. Eni, Shell and KazMunayGaz are also partners in Karachaganak, alongside Chevron and LUKOIL. Both projects are covered by production sharing agreements stipulating that companies can deduct certain costs from income before splitting it with the government. The size of the deductions claimed by the companies would determine how much income there is to be split between them and the government. Kashagan and Karachaganak are the second- and third-biggest producers of oil respectively in the Central Asian nation whose economy relies heavily on energy exports. The Astana government has already had a series of disputes with its partners about the terms of oil deals, which typically ended with settlements. ",

            "articleBody": "  The current system has not been updated in more than two decades.The US Energy Department (DOE) on Monday proposed reducing electric vehicles' (EV) mileage ratings to meet government fuel economy requirements, a move that could force automakers to sell more low-emissions cars or improve conventional models.  DOE wants to significantly revise how it calculates the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy rating for electric and plug-in electric hybrids for use in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program. The current system has not been updated in more than two decades.  \"Encouraging adoption of EVs can reduce petroleum consumption but giving too much credit for that adoption can lead to increased net petroleum use because it enables lower fuel economy among conventional vehicles, which represent by far the majority of vehicles sold,\" DOE said in its proposed regulation. Miles Per Gallon equivalent (MPGe) ratings are determined by using values for national electricity, petroleum generation and distribution efficiency and driving patterns. Environmental groups note fuel economy ratings for EVs is far higher for determining CAFE compliance than those listed on the government's consumer website. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major automakers, warned last year that lowering the values could have far-reaching implications and would discourage EV adoption.  The group said on Monday it was unclear how the proposed DOE calculation would be incorporated in future CAFE standards. A Volkswagen ID.4 EV with a current 380.6 MPGe under CAFE would get 107.4 MPGe under the DOE proposal, while a Ford F-150 EV drops from 237.1 to 67.1 MPGe and Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid falls from 88.2 to 59.5 MPGe.  The Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club petitioned for the change in 2021, arguing \"excessively high imputed fuel economy values for EVs means that a relatively small number of EVs will mathematically guarantee compliance without meaningful improvements in the real-world average fuel economy of automakers' overall fleets.\" Tesla backed the environmental groups petition. The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday will propose new rules to spur sweeping cuts in vehicle emissions that will push automakers towards a big increase in electric vehicle sales, sources told Reuters last week. The 2027 to 2032 model year pollution cuts are expected to result in at least half of the new US vehicle fleet by 2030 being electric or plug-in hybrids, sources said, in line with a goal President Joe Biden outlined in 2021. NHTSA is expected to soon propose parallel new stringent CAFE requirements. In 2022, NHTSA sharply boosted CAFE standards for vehicles, reversing former President Donald Trump's rollback. Automakers buy credits or pay fines if they cannot meet CAFE requirements. Stellantis, then known as Fiat Chrysler, paid $152.3 million in total CAFE fines for 2016 and 2017 and faces additional civil penalties. In 2022, NHTSA more than doubled CAFE penalties.",

The world's largest coal mining company will likely end the fiscal year ending on Friday with an output of 703.4 million tonnes, it said, 13% higher than the 622.6 million tonnes it produced the previous fiscal year. \"The volume increase of a whopping 81 million tonnes in a single year, by fiscal year 2023 end, would be a historic high since the company's inception,\" the company said in a statement on Friday. Coal India last achieved its annual production target in 2006, when it produced 343.4 million tonnes against a plan to produce 343 million tonnes. The miner, which accounts for 80% of India's annual coal output, is targeting production of 780 million tonnes in the upcoming fiscal year, in a bid to fire its power utilities, which are expected to burn about 8% more coal in the year. India's coal-fired power output has increased much faster than any other country in the Asia Pacific since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, underscoring the challenges the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter faces in weaning its economy off carbon. The government has previously cited lower per capita emissions compared with richer nations and surging renewable energy output, when asked about rising coal use. Coal accounts for nearly 75% of India's power generation and utilities account for more than 75% of its coal use. India is the world's second largest producer, consumer and importer of the fuel. Coal India intends to ramp up production to 1 billion tonnes by March 2026 by increasing the capacity of its existing mines and opening new mines.",

            "articleBody": "  The biogas unit in Sonapur, being set up under the Centre's SATAK scheme, will be operational by November this year and will have an installed capacity of five tonnes CBG daily.Guwahati: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday described compressed biogas (CBG) plants as an important alternative energy source, as such units have a cascading impact on the local economy with the raw materials procured from nearby areas. He stressed on the need to focus on renewable and alternative energy sources to overcome the challenges of global warming and environmental pollution. Speaking at the foundation stone laying ceremony of a CBG unit at Domora Pather in Sonapur on the outskirts of Guwahati, Sarma said, \"In view of the threats posed by global warming, people should use less of fossil fuel and concentrate more on deriving power and fuel from other sources.\" He pointed out that solar plants are increasingly coming up for meeting power requirements, use of hydrogen-derived fuel for vehicles is being explored and small CBG plants can also go a long way in meeting fuel demand for vehicles and industries. The biogas units also have \"a cascading impact on the local economy as the raw materials, like municipal solid waste, cow dung, hay, etc. are sourced from the nearby areas,\" he said. Mentioning that such a plant in Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh uses dung as the raw material, Sarma said, \"At one time, people thought rearing cows was no longer a profitable venture. But the age-old adage that cows are always the most profitable has been proved once again. \"Instead of killing the animal for the meat, people are now trying to keep them alive and use the dung as a source of fuel,\" Sarma said. The biogas unit in Sonapur, being set up under the Centre's SATAK scheme, will be operational by November this year and will have an installed capacity of five tonnes CBG daily. Guwahati-based Redlemon Technologies Pvt Ltd, which is setting up the plant, has proposed two more such units in the state, he added. The Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAK) scheme on CBG was launched on October 1, 2018. The programme envisages a target production of 15 MMT (million tonnes) of CBG by 2023 from 5,000 Plants. Sarma also said that the Reliance group has also evinced interest in starting 16 CBG plants in the state, using hay and paddy residuals as raw materials. \"For a state like ours, rich in natural resources, we should focus on clean and renewable energy sources, and our government is working towards it,\" the CM added.",

            "articleBody": "We need all colours of hydrogen, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner told Reuters in an interview, referring to a dispute in Brussels around hydrogen produced from nuclear or renewable energy. As European Union countries debate the potential role of hydrogen in decarbonising the economy and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuel, they are struggling to agree over how hydrogen should be produced. A debate over whether to focus on hydrogen made using renewable power, such as wind and solar, or to allow low-carbon hydrogen made with nuclear energy has delayed negotiations on new EU renewable energy targets and threatened a multibillion-euro hydrogen pipeline. \"Blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas, and red hydrogen, which is produced from nuclear energy, can make a very important contribution towards establishing the hydrogen economy in a transition phase,\" Lindner said. He said hydrogen from renewable energy is preferable in the long term, but in the nearer term the EU needs to build a market structure with a reliable supply at affordable prices. \"For me, it is therefore hard to imagine that Germany would position itself against this in Europe,\" Lindner said. The issue is divisive not only across Europe, but within Germany where opposition is still high to nuclear energy even though some politicians have said it is necessary to extend its use now the country can no longer rely on the Russian pipeline gas that powered the economy for decades. In the EU negotiations, France, which relies heavily on nuclear generation, is leading the campaign to promote nuclear energy's contribution to cutting CO2 emissions. Germany and Spain have said this risks detracting from efforts to massively expand renewable energy. ",

            "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government delivered India&rsquo;s annual budget on Wednesday that laid out a slew of measures to bolster infrastructure for creating more jobs and attract investment ahead of next year&rsquo;s crucial national election.With a year to go for national polls, it&rsquo;s crucial for Modi to tackle the issues of high unemployment and inflation as he seeks to win a third consecutive term. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman focused on farmers, so-called backward castes and women to deal with the inequities exacerbated by the pandemic.The government increased capital spending 33 per cent to 10 trillion rupees ($122 billion) that will enable the country to expand its network of roads, ports and airports and make it an attractive destination for investors.WINNERSAgriculture The government has increased spending in the farm sector, which accounts for about 19 per cent of the economy. The budget proposes to spend 22 billion rupees ($269 million) on high-value horticulture and set up an agriculture accelerator fund to finance farm startups. This will benefit companies such as Kaveri Seed Co., Dhanuka Agritech Ltd., Bombay Super Hybrid Seeds, Rashtriya Chemicals &amp; Fertilizers Ltd.TourismTo capture the surge in travel demand, India will select 50 destinations to promote domestic tourism. It will also develop an app to guide tourists on food streets, security, physical and virtual connectivity to lift their experience. Ticketing companies and hotels such as Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp., Thomas Cook India Ltd., Indian Hotels and EIH Ltd. will be the beneficiaries.InfrastructureCrucial to boosting last-mile connectivity, India has decided to build 50 additional airports, heliports and aerodromes and identified 100 fresh projects. Railways will benefit from a record capital outlay of 2.4 trillion rupees. This is a win for airport operators such as Adani Airport Holdings Ltd., GMR Airports Infrastructure Ltd., GVK Airport Developers Ltd., and construction companies like Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd. and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. TaxpayersAs expected, Modi&rsquo;s administration gave some relief to taxpayers. Individuals with income up to 700,000 rupees won&rsquo;t have to pay tax under the new income tax regime. The number of tax slabs were reduced, while the maximum tax rate was cut to 39 per cent. This will leave more money with the middle class that can also boost consumption demand.Metal/CementHigher capital expenditure and investments for housing, infrastructure, railways announced in the budget are positive for steel mills and cement makers. Key gainers include Tata Steel Ltd., JSW Steel Ltd., Jindal Steel &amp; Power Ltd.Electric Vehicles India plans to provide impetus to green mobility by exempting from customs duty on import of capital goods required to manufacture lithium-ion cells used in electric vehicle batteries. This will be a boost for battery makers such as Exide Industries Ltd. and Amara Raja Batteries Ltd. and automakers like Tata Motors Ltd., Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd.Green EnergyThe budget provided 350 billion-rupee investment in energy transition and carbon neutrality initiatives. The government will provide financial support to battery energy storage systems with capacity of 4,000 megawatt hour.LOSERSCigarette MakersShares of ITC Ltd. and Godfrey Phillips India plunged in early Mumbai trading after India increased a tax, effective Feb. 2, on specified cigarettes by about 16 per cent.JewelersJewelry stocks dropped after the government left the import taxes on gold unchanged despite demand from the bullion industry to reverse the hike announced in July. The government also increased the import tax on silver. A higher tax increases the cost for consumers as the country imports almost all the bullion it consumes. The benchmark gold futures in Mumbai rose as much as 1.3 per cent to an all-time high of 57,950 rupees per 10 grams. Key losers would be Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd., Titan Co. and PC Jeweller Ltd.Oil RefinersIndian state-run refiners Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp., Hindustan Petroleum Corp. are likely losers as the government didn&rsquo;t announce any compensation toward losses on keeping a check on diesel and gasoline prices. There have been demands from the companies and the oil ministry to partly cover the losses via a budgetary support.Foreign CarmakersImported automobiles, including electric vehicles, will attract higher levies. The customs duty on cars and EVs priced above $40,000 imported in completely-built units were increased to 70 per cent from 60 per cent. Foreign carmakers like BYD Co. and Mercedes Benz that rely on imported cars to serve Indian market will face challenges.",

            "articleBody": "  Hedge funds and other money managers purchased the equivalent of 232 million barrels in the six most important futures and options contracts over the six weeks ended Jan. 24.Portfolio investors have piled into petroleum futures and options at the fastest rate since the first successful coronavirus vaccines were announced in late 2020. China's exit from a zero-COVID strategy, along with hopes the global economy can avoid a recession and low oil inventories, have contributed to an extraordinary wave of buying across the petroleum complex. Hedge funds and other money managers purchased the equivalent of 232 million barrels in the six most important futures and options contracts over the six weeks ended Jan. 24. Purchases were the fastest for any six-week period since December 2020, according to an analysis of position records published by ICE Futures Europe and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In the most recent week, fund managers purchased the equivalent of 70 million barrels, mostly in Brent (+40 million) and to a much lesser extent NYMEX and ICE WTI (+4 million). But the wave of buying spread beyond crude to encompass U.S. gasoline (+11 million barrels), U.S. diesel (+8 million) and European gas oil (+7 million). Refinery shutdowns linked to seasonal maintenance as well as sanctions on Russia's diesel exports are expected to deplete fuel inventories further. Chartbook: Investor petroleum positions The net position across all six contracts climbed to 575 million barrels (47th percentile for all weeks since 2013), up from 343 million barrels (11th percentile) on Dec. 13. The net position is at highest since Nov. 8 and before that June 14. There was a strongly bullish orientation, with long positions outnumbering short ones by a ratio of 5.93:1 (80th percentile) up from 2.58:1 (23rd percentile) five weeks earlier. The most bullish ratios are concentrated in Brent (86th percentile), U.S. gasoline (85th percentile) and U.S. diesel (86th percentile), with less optimism about European gas oil (65th percentile) and WTI (41st percentile). Refinery maintenance in the United States is expected to deplete fuel inventories there but leave WTI prices trailing Brent, which probably explains the differential performance. Hedge funds became more bullish about Brent than at any time since May 2019, before the pandemic erupted and upended the oil industry. There is a growing tension at the heart of investor positioning. In the bond market, investors are increasingly confident inflation will moderate, allowing central banks to bring an early end to interest rate rises. In the oil market, investors are increasingly sure continued growth will cause supplies to tighten and send prices higher. But that would be inflationary - and contradicts to the benign outlook assumed by the bond market. Oil traders and bond traders cannot both be right.By John Kemp",

            "articleBody": "  Indonesia's investment ministry cited BASF chief executive Martin Brudermuller as saying the project investment would be worth around 2.4 billion euros ($2.59 billion).Germany's BASF and French miner Eramet are finalising a $2.6 billion partnership deal to invest in a facility in Indonesia to process nickel for use in batteries for electric vehicles, Indonesian officials said. The Indonesian announcement comes as Southeast Asia's biggest economy has been courting global companies to build facilities to produce EV batteries and electric cars to exploit the country's rich nickel resources. In separate emailed responses, the companies confirmed they were assessing a hydro-metallurgical project to produce battery-grade nickel and cobalt from Eramet's mine in Indonesia's Weda Bay, but did not confirm the proposed investment. Indonesia's investment ministry cited BASF chief executive Martin Brudermuller as saying the project investment would be worth around 2.4 billion euros ($2.59 billion). \"We would like to convey that our agreement with Eramet is at the final stage. It is likely that our decision will be taken in the first half of 2023,\" the ministry quoted Brudermuller as saying. Eramet spokeswoman Fanny Mounier said the project was subject to a final investment decision and further details would be disclosed if a decision was made. BASF spokesman Paul Warkentin also said more details would be given once an assessment had been concluded. The planned plant would produce mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) from nickel through a high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) plant. MHP is used in electric vehicle batteries. Eramet said the plant could start production in early 2026 investment decision subject to a final investment decision, with an output capacity of up to 67,000 tonnes of nickel and 7,000 tonnes of cobalt contained in MHP per year. BASF and Eramet's investment plan was in line with the government's \"aspirations to set up Indonesia as world-class EV player,\" said Indonesian Investment Minister Bahlil Lahadalia. Indonesia is also finalising agreements with Chinese automaker BYD Group and Tesla to invest in EV production facilities, a senior cabinet minister said on Tuesday. Once the biggest supplier of nickel to the global stainless steel industry, nickel producers in Indonesia have been retooling so they can take advantage of the growing demand for nickel in batteries. While overall battery demand for nickel makes up a small portion of the 3 million tonne market, Indonesia is primed to become the world's biggest supplier as it builds out some 4.5 million tonnes of capacity that can supply both markets over the next five years, analysts estimate. Investment into MHP production in Indonesia has so far been dominated by Chinese companies such as Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt and Tsingshan Holding Group. Separately, Australia's Nickel Industries said on Wednesday it will raise $471 million in capital to help fund the acquisition of several nickel projects in Indonesia. To develop battery nickel, the company will also look to collaborate with Shanghai Decent Investment (Group) Co Ltd, a unit of the Tsingshan Group. ",

            "articleBody": "  Both contracts registered gains on Monday and Tuesday, rebounding from a sharp sell-off in the first week of 2023.Oil prices rose on Wednesday as hopes for an improved global economic outlook and concern over the impact of sanctions on Russian crude output outweighed a higher than expected build in US crude and fuel stocks. Brent crude futures were up $1.48, or 1.9 per cent, at $81.58 a barrel by 1436 GMT. U.S and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $1.35, or 1.8 per cent, to $76.47. Both contracts registered gains on Monday and Tuesday, rebounding from a sharp sell-off in the first week of 2023. Global equities were up slightly on Wednesday on hopes that US inflation and earnings figures due on Thursday point to a resilient economy and slower pace of interest rate hikes. If inflation comes in below expectations, that would drive the dollar lower, analysts said, which could boost oil demand because it makes the commodity cheaper for buyers holding other currencies. Some of the market's optimism was pinned on top oil importer China's reopening of its economy after the end of strict COVID-19 curbs. \"China could bounce back strongly, especially if backed by monetary and fiscal stimulus. Central banks may discover they have room to cut rates if inflation falls substantially and economies are in recession,\" said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA in London. \"(Also) Russian output could be squeezed as sanctions take their toll.\" An international price cap imposed on sales of Russian crude took effect on Dec. 5 and more curbs aimed at products sales are set to come into force next month. US crude oil stockpiles, meanwhile, jumped by 14.9 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 6, sources said, citing data from the American Petroleum Institute (API).  Analysts polled by Reuters had expected crude stocks to fall. Traders will be looking out for inventory data from the US Energy Information Administration, expected at 1530 GMT. ",

            "articleBody": "      The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said it plans to introduce companion stringent vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards from 2027 through at least the 2030 model year by March.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) plans to propose new fuel economy standards for the 2027 model year and beyond in April which could dramatically reshape new cars on America's roads. Acting NHTSA Administrator Ann Carlson told reporters on Tuesday the agency aims to release its proposal by late April and finalize it within a year. The proposal will include regulatory alternatives. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said it plans to introduce companion stringent vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards from 2027 through at least the 2030 model year by March. One big question is whether the new rules will be consistent with California's aggressive efforts to ramp up zero emission vehicles and phase out new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. California Air Resources Board Executive Officer Steven Cliff, who was NHTSA administrator until September, told Reuters in a recent interview that the federal government should \"look at stringency that's equivalent to our rules.\" \"We're 68 per cent zero emissions in 2030 so modeling that and looking at that as an option for 2030 is absolutely critical,\" he said. U.S. President Joe Biden wants 50 per cent of all new vehicles sold in 2030 to be electric or plug-in hybrid models but has not endorsed California's 2035 plans. In March 2020, Trump's Republican administration rolled back then-President Barack Obama's standards to only 1.5 per cent annual increases in efficiency through 2026. That was much less than the 5 per cent annual increases required by Obama. The Biden administration in 2021 reversed Trump's action and told the relevant agencies to begin work on the next round of tougher rules. In March, NHTSA reinstated a sharp increase in penalties for automakers whose vehicles do not meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements for model years 2019 and beyond. NHTSA has not collected penalties for model years 2019 through 2021 while the issue was under review and subject of court challenges. \"We're in the process of evaluating and gathering the data necessary,\" Carlson said, declining to say when it might impose fines. \"We haven't forgotten about it.\" The auto industry previously said penalty hikes could cost them at least $1 billion annually, both for failures to meet the rules and higher prices for credits sold by companies like Tesla Inc used to meet requirements. Chrysler-parent Stellantis said last year it booked an incremental provision of 660 million euros ($708.44 million) resulting from the 2019-2021 CAFE penalty rate increase. The company then known as Fiat Chrysler paid $152.3 million in total CAFE fines for 2016 and 2017 model years. ",

            "articleBody": "  China announced more state support measures on Thursday.By Emily ChowOil prices rose as much as $1 on Friday, extending gains from the previous session, supported by hopes of a China demand boost and after data showed lower U.S. fuel inventories following a winter storm that hit at the end of the year. Brent crude futures were 75 cents, or 1%, higher at $79.44 a barrel at 0645 GMT, after settling 85 cents stronger at $78.69 on Thursday.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 74 cents, or 1%, at $74.41 a barrel. They had settled 83 cents higher at $73.67 in the previous session. \"China's reopening optimism, especially further stimulus measures to boost the property sector, is the main bullish factor for the oil prices, which has improved the demand outlook in the near year,\" said Tina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets.  \"A softened U.S. dollar has also added upside momentum to the oil markets,\" she added.  China announced more state support measures on Thursday, including establishing a dynamic adjustment mechanism on mortgage rates for first-time home buyers, in a bid to boost its highly indebted property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the country's economy. The total number of passenger trips via road, rail, water and air during the upcoming Lunar New Year is expected to reach 2.1 billion this year, transport officials said on Friday, double the 1.05 billion during the same period last year. Daily passenger flights scheduled during the holiday season beginning on Saturday are averaging 73% of pre-pandemic levels in 2019. China, the world's largest crude oil importer, has ended its stringent zero-COVID policy, leading to a surge in COVID infections across the country. In the U.S., data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed on Thursday that distillate inventories, which include diesel and heating oil, dropped more than expected in the week to Dec. 30. They fell by 1.4 million barrels, compared with expectations of a 396,000-barrel drop.  Meanwhile, U.S. gasoline stocks fell 346,000 barrels last week, according to the EIA data, compared with analysts' expectations for a 486,000-barrel drop. On a weekly basis, however, oil prices were on track to end lower, with both the Brent and WTI contracts down around 7% on a week earlier. Concern about the possibility of a global recession have weighed on trading sentiment. \"Oil is trying to rally but demand concerns are keeping the gains small,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note.  \"The Saudis are slashing prices as the short-term crude demand outlook seems like it won't quite get a major boost from a robust China reopening.\" The world's top crude exporter Saudi Arabia lowered prices for the flagship Arab light crude it sells to Asia to its lowest since November 2021 amid global pressures hitting oil.Also Read:  Stellantis CEO delivers a technology statement with a Ram truckThe electric \"Ram 1500 Revolution,\" unveiled at CES in Las Vegas, is a one-of-a-kind show vehicle meant to whet appetites for a production model due in 2024.

            "articleBody": "Tata chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran on Friday called Indian economy a bright spot in the global economy which otherwise is facing recessionary impulses, multidecade high inflation and squeezing household income. He also highlighted key reforms which could contribute in the process. He said India's economy is one of the fastest growing major economies and has the potential to gain a top spot in the global economy by 2047- a year which marks the 100 years of India's independence. India's economy jumped to fifth position from the 10th spot bagging the title of fifth largest economy. India, by 2047, may become a USD 25-30 trillion economy with a growth rate of nearly 8 per cent. \"Size and quantum of growth is not the only thing but it is also crucial to spread the gains of the future to everyone,\" he added.While speaking at FICCI's 95th Annual Convention, Chandrasekaran highlighted the significance of inclusive and sustainable growth for India. \"The pressure to accelerate towards sustainable growth is going to increase globally. India, at that point, can lead in electric vehicle segment, storage batteries, water efficiency and in designing circular economy solutions,\" he said.The Tata chairman discussed how global rebalancing can turn out to be a massive opportunity for India's economy. The geopolitical tensions have disrupted the supply-chain. With focus on human capital, sustainability and use of technology, the opportunity can be utilised by India to gain a prominent spot in the global economy. Taking into consideration the job creation aspect, he said, \"given our economic development curve, it is a great opportunity for country to create jobs by building green economy whether through solar energy, sustainable cooling or waste management.\"Inclusion of more women in work force may act as a catalyst and influence India's economic growth, pitched Chandrasekaran. He said half of the labour force should constitute women. While highlighting significance of Tourism sector, he stated that enhancement in the sector will lead to creation of jobs, generation of valuable forex and better connectivity which is likely to give a boost to the economy. The focus on primary healthcare is an important aspect of the India's growth spectrum. Citizens should be provided with accessible and affordable healthcare system. Better research and use of technology could improve India's healthcare. Education is also an important sector which could contribute in making India a leading economy. \"The success in education should be shifted from focus on attainable education to educational outcome,\" he stated.Chandrasekaran also revealed how India can churn out growth opportunities from the use of technology. \"India's massive technology potential can be utilised to address some of the most persistent challenges,\" he said. Technology can be used in all sector of Indian economy to provide users/customers with a seamless experience, he stated.Controlling air pollution and reducing it to one-fourth of the current levels could also contribute in making country green and livable. The upcoming Budget for 2023 might as well focus on these key aspects and reforms. ",

            "articleBody": "New British Prime Minister Liz Truss will cap soaring consumer power bills on Thursday and promote new sources of energy in an expected 100 billion pound ($115 billion)-plus package designed to limit the economic shock caused by the war in Ukraine. With Britain facing a lengthy recession sparked by a near quadrupling of household energy bills, Truss - appointed prime minister on Tuesday - has said she will take immediate action to protect consumers. A jump in government borrowing to fund the support package plus a pledge by Truss to cut taxes has rattled financial markets. On Wednesday the pound fell against the dollar to levels last hit in 1985. Truss is expected to set out her plan to lawmakers at around 1000 GMT. Deutsche Bank said the energy price offset and the promised tax cuts could cost 179 billion pounds, or about half of the amount Britain spent on the COVID-19 pandemic. The government is also expected to set out new sources of energy supply including the issuance of up to 130 oil and gas exploration licences in the North Sea and a scrapping of a ban on fracking if local communities agree. \"We will take action immediately to help people and businesses with bills but also ...to tackle the root cause of these problems, so that we are not in this position again,\" Truss said in a statement. \"We will set out our plans to deliver on that promise and build a prosperous Britain for everyone.\"  DAUNTING CHALLENGESWith industrial unrest also spreading, Truss faces one of the most daunting sets of challenges for an incoming leader in Britain's post-war history. Her plan is expected to cool inflation - which at 10.1% is already the highest of any leading economy - but it will add more than 100 billion pounds to Britain's borrowing, putting more strain on public finances with the energy crisis possibly lasting into next winter. It also marks a major turnaround from her rejection of \"handouts\" during the early stages of the Conservative Party leadership campaign. Charities had warned that millions of households face destitution this winter if the cap on average energy prices were allowed to jump 80% in October and again in winter. Companies are also at risk. Many have received new energy bills that they say threaten to put them out of business. According to two sources familiar with the government's discussions, Truss will announce dozens of new North Sea exploration licences in a bid to boost domestic production. She is also expected to lift a ban on fracking, which involves extracting shale gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. It was banned in 2019 after the oil and gas authority said it was not possible to predict the magnitude of earthquakes it might trigger. Neither of the proposals will provide any short-term relief however as it typically takes between five to 10 years from initial exploration until oil and gas is produced from a field. Fracking projects will require a lengthy planning process. \"If we want energy sufficiency, we have to look at every source including clearly new nuclear or more renewables,\" the minister for levelling up, Simon Clarke, told Sky News. \"We also ought to look at technologies like fracking... There is a balanced approach to this question.\"",

Public sector undertaking companies on the other hand maintain that fuel supplies are absolutely normal and that there is adequate product availability.The Oil Ministry too denied reports of any shortages, but on Friday extended the Universal Service Obligation (USO) to all retail outlets, including those in remote rural areas. An official statement said that these USO include maintaining supplies of petrol and diesel throughout the specified working hours and of specified quality and quantity.&ldquo;This has been done with an objective to ensure higher level of customer services in the market and to ensure that adherence to the USO forms a part of the market discipline,&rdquo; the oil ministry said.According to the AITMC, there is a concern among the transport operators as without fuel they could get stuck in the middle of the journey and fail the delivery timelines.&ldquo;Though the government is assuring of sufficient supplies but the ground realty is quite different,&rdquo; the AITMC statement added.",

            "articleBody": "TOKYO: Oil prices eased in early trade on Tuesday as concerns over a possible recession and weaker consumption outweighed an expectation of tight global supply and a pick-up in fuel demand in China after Beijing's promises of stimulus. Brent crude futures for July slid 35 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $113.07 a barrel by 0122 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for July delivery dropped 36 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $109.93 a barrel. Both benchmarks declined by more than $1 earlier in the session. Brent gained 0.7 per cent on Monday while WTI settled nearly flat. Multiple threats to the global economy topped the worries of the world's well-heeled at the annual Davos economic summit, with some flagging the risk of a worldwide recession. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said she did not expect a recession for major economies but could not rule one out. \"Investors were selling off as they expected higher oil prices to dent consumption for fuels worldwide,\" said Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities Co Ltd. \"But lingering concerns over tight global supply and hopes for demand recovery in China were providing some support,\" he said, predicting Brent to stay within a boxed range of $105-$115 a barrel for a while. The world is facing an oil supply crunch with most companies afraid to invest in the sector as they face green energy pressures, the head of Saudi Aramco told Reuters, adding it cannot expand production capacity any faster than promised. China, the world's top oil importer, will broaden its tax credit rebates, postpone social security payments and loan repayments, roll out new investment projects and take other steps to support the economy, state television quoted the cabinet as saying on Monday. Shanghai, China's commercial hub, aims to normalise life from June 1 as its coronavirus caseloads decline, though rising new COVID-19 cases in Beijing raised concerns for further curbs. Meanwhile, the European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports \"within days,\" according to its biggest member Germany, as Moscow said it saw its economic ties growing with China after being isolated by the West over its invasion of Ukraine.

            "articleBody": "Rising crude oil import bills have pushed the Indian government to look for other alternatives fuel sources such as Ethanol and Biodiesel. On our journey to majority electrification, biofuels are a legitimate way to a more sustainable fuel industry. Currently, the transport sector, railways and aviation are the major end-users of biodiesel in India. As per a FY2021 quarterly update, India&rsquo;s biodiesel market demand stood at 0.17 million tonnes despite major setbacks due to the pandemic induced disruption in supply chains. The report predicted a healthy growth of 8.60 per cent CAGR until 2030, with a forecasted demand set to reach 0.26 million tonnes. Initiation of the 2019 National Policy on Biofuels and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India&rsquo;s (FSSAI) Repurposed Used Cooking Oil (RUCO) project have further encouraged legacy players and startups alike to jump on the bandwagon. With India&rsquo;s primary energy demand set to double by 2040, the use of alternative fuels such as Biodiesel is bound to grow as well. These fuels also help reduce the environmental impact as the end product is 95 per cent carbon-free on average. Used cooking oil, animal fats, imported crude vegetable oils and Jatropha seeds are used to produce alternative fuels such as Biodiesel.      Representational imageBut with India only contributing to 1 per cent of the global biofuel production, alternative fuels are still a niche in our country. That is where the Central Government is providing support to domestic players such as Mumbai-based UCO aggregator, Aris Bioenergy, to invest and tap into the market&rsquo;s potential. 'Since 2018 we are developing the aggregation system in Maharashtra and a few other states such as Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat. We are aggregating feedstock such as UCO and supplying them to refineries that are converting it into biodiesel. These refineries are recognised by the FSSAI to produce biodiesel from UCO. We are also in a joint venture with GreenFuels UK to build twenty biodiesel refineries in India. Our first conversion plant will come up in Khopoli which will use UCO and other feedstock from Maharashtra to make biodiesel.' Mr Umesh Waghdhare, Managing Director of ARIS BioEnergy said during an exclusive interaction with TOI Auto. Speaking on aggregation potential in India, Waghdhare said that in and around urban cities of India, for every 10+ lakh population, we can expect 30,000 kgs of used cooking oil that can be used to make biodiesel. Since 2019, Aris Bioenergy has converted 16,00,000 (lakh) kgs of UCO in Maharashtra itself. In the same time frame, other major players such as Universal Biofuels set a record by delivering 20 million litres of Biodiesel to domestic oil marketing companies in FY2021. Hence the potential for aggregating biofuels in India is immense.      Umesh Waghdhare - Founder and Managing Director, Aris Bioenergy Waghdhare further stated, 'The government is aiming for more than 5 per cent blend of biodiesel in normal diesel used in vehicles. GOI further has a 105 crore litre open tender for the supply of biodiesel produced from UCO. A demand that has not even been met at 5 per cent up till now. So that is a humongous target for the whole industry. The concept has been proven in European countries like Germany where B5, B10 and B20 blends of diesel and petrol are being used.' Sustainable fuels such as Biodiesel can be blended with their fossil counterparts in several form factors. They help run a cleaner combustion cycle and do not harm an engine. From transport, and railways to aviation. Alternative fuels are set to mark a growing presence.Bottom line is, that biofuels have the potential to change India&rsquo;s energy spend and consumption. The demand is there but production and supply are not where it needs to be. However, major players like Biomax Fuels, Universal Biofuels and startups like Aris Bioenergy are hot on the trail. While the passenger vehicles sector rides its electric wave, the biofuel industry is building its own foundations with sustainable fuels that can serve India&rsquo;s energy requirements in real-time.

REUTERS/Yves HermanBRUSSELS: The EU preserved a sense of rarely seen unity through four rounds of sanctions against Russia. But at a summit Thursday, the 27 leaders faced division on the biggest issue of all: energy. During the first month of war, EU nations imposed tough measures targeting Russia&rsquo;s economy and financial system. Unlike the US, they have so far spared Russian fossil fuels, highlighting the EU&rsquo;s reliance on the country&rsquo;s oil, natural gas and coal to keep homes warm and the wheels of industry turning. &ldquo;We are not at war with ourselves,&rdquo; Belgian PM Alexander De Croo said at the summit in Brussels. &ldquo;Sanctions must always have a much bigger impact on the Russian side than on ours.&rdquo; He reflected the position of EU nations like Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. They are running up against other member states situated closer to Russia that want tougher action now. &ldquo;As long as we are purchasing energy from Russia, we are financing the war,&rdquo; Finland PM Sanna Marin said. She was joined by Baltic leaders in demanding swift action.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Rating agency Fitch on Tuesday slashed India's growth forecast for the next fiscal to 8.5 per cent from 10.3 per cent, citing sharply high energy prices on account of the Russia-Ukraine war.With the Omicron wave subsiding quickly, containment measures have been scaled back, setting the stage for a pick-up in GDP growth momentum in the June quarter this year, the agency said.It has revised upwards the GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal by 0.6 percentage points to 8.7 per cent.\"However, we have lowered our growth forecast for FY 2022-2023 to 8.5 per cent (-1.8 pp) on sharply higher energy prices,\" Fitch said while revising up its inflation forecasts.In its Global economic Outlook-March 2022, Fitch said the post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery is being hit by a potentially huge global supply shock that will reduce growth and push up inflation.\"The war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have put global energy supplies at risk. Sanctions seem unlikely to be rescinded any time soon,\" the agency said.Russia supplies around 10 per cent of the world's energy, including 17 per cent of its natural gas and 12 per cent of oil.\" The jump in oil and gas prices will add to industry costs and reduce consumers' real incomes...Higher energy prices are a given,\" Fitch said as it cut the world GDP growth forecast by 0.7 percentage points to 3.5 per cent.Observing that Indian GDP growth was very strong in the December quarter, the agency said the GDP is more than 6 per cent above its pre-pandemic level though it is still well below its implied pre-pandemic trend.\"High-frequency data indicate that the Indian economy has ridden out the Omicron wave with little damage &ndash;in stark contrast with the two previous coronavirus waves in 2020 and 2021,\" it said.Fitch now sees inflation strengthening further, peaking above 7 per cent in the December quarter of 2022, before gradually easing.The agency expects inflation to remain elevated throughout the forecast horizon, at 6.1 per cent annual average in 2021 and 5 per cent in 2022.\"Local fuel prices have been flat over the past weeks, but we assume that oil companies will eventually pass on higher oil prices to retail fuel prices (with some offset from a reduction in the excise duty by the government),\" it added.

            "articleBody": "The Reserve Bank&rsquo;s projection of 4.5% retail inflation in the next financial year 2022-23 as against 5.3% seen in the current fiscal FY22, seems to be a bit optimistic and ambitious in the light of current price pressures the economy is facing, experts said. Rising oil prices are the thorniest risk to this peg and also other energy commodities continue to remain at elevated levels, they pointed out which does not help either, they said. &ldquo;The inflation projection of 4.5% next year looks a bit optimistic. Rising prices of oil remain a concern. Core inflation, too, which does not include food and fuel inflation, is moving up. And then we are seeing companies looking at passing the remaining costs increases to customers which could not yet pass on due to the third wave,&rdquo; Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda told ETCFO. He sees FY23 inflation at about 5-5.5%. Global energy prices have seen an unprecedented increase in the last year or so amid supply-side disruptions. Oil, steel, copper, and a host of other commodities have shot up significantly and continue to remain at elevated levels. This has resulted in an increase in transportation costs too. Food inflation, too, isn&rsquo;t at a very comforting level either with prices of edible oil still quite high. To battle this unprecedented inflation and protect margins, companies, across multiple sectors including auto, tyres, consumer durables, fast-moving consumer goods, clothing, and apparel etc, have been increasing their product prices. Some of them have been able to pass on the full costs, while others have been able to pass on the increases with a lag so that demand remains unaffected. Kunal Kumar Kundu, economist, Societe Generale gave a similar sense to what Bank of Baroda&rsquo;s Sabnavis said. He sees inflation peaking out in the current quarter or the first quarter of the next fiscal, but he highlighted it will still be much higher than the median target.&ldquo;Since the last two years inflation has been much higher, my worry is we have been ignoring high inflation for way too long, in the guise of believing that it is transitory,&rdquo; Kundu told ETCFO. &ldquo;...the more we delay in tackling inflation, it might come to a level that RBI might have to be much more aggressive with the rate hikes at a later stage to contain the impact, and this can come at long term growth prospects.&rdquo; Kundu worried.Shravan Shetty, MD at Primus Partners added to the debate saying that government policies in respect of containing fuel inflation via excise duty cuts as well the robust monsoon next financial year could help the economy contain retail inflation at 4.5%.A CFO&rsquo;s perspective Hemant Ruia, CFO at a top infra firm, indicated that inflation is likely to remain a pain point for the CFOs next financial year too. &ldquo; The RBI must have factored in a few increases in arriving at its inflation forecast, but it seems to have underplayed the projection by about 50-100 basis points. But then CFOs have to battle it out whatever the actual number turns out to be. They have to look at different possible ways to tackle inflation&rdquo; Ruia signed off.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Industry body India Hydrogen Alliance (IH2A) has made various submissions to the government seeking budgetary support for the development of a hydrogen economy in India. IH2A has made submissions to the government for budgetary support for creation of 10 National BharatH2 Clusters, a $1 billion Hydrogen Economy Development Fund (HEDF) and a Public-Private Hydrogen Taskforce, in the Union Budget for 2022-23, IH2A said in a statement.  \"Funding support is critical for development of a hydrogen economy in India. A comprehensive set of policy interventions and budget incentives covering the entire hydrogen value chain are needed.  \"Public and private funding for hydrogen should cover the entire supply chain - from production and supply-side, storage and transport as well as demand side to encourage industrial off-take in hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the economy,\" Jill Evanko, Chief Executive and President, Chart Industries, and founding member, IH2A, said.  IH2A estimates that India will need investments of about USD 25 billion, from public and private sectors, to create a domestic hydrogen supply chain with national installed electrolyser capacity of 25 GW producing 5 million tonnes per annum of Green Hydrogen by 2030.  \"We have proposed a Hydrogen Economy Development Fund to be created to fund at least 10 GW-scale National H2 Projects by end 2022 bringing together consortia of industry players to create the first-generation of national hydrogen clusters,\" Evanko said.  IH2A said coordinated public-private actions will be required to develop the first generation of large-scale commercial hydrogen projects.  \"We have also proposed a public-private Bharat H2 Taskforce that will act as the combined expert advisory group, bringing together national and global hydrogen expertise in hydrogen technology, project development, safety standards and funding, to all Indian stakeholders.  \"The creation of the public-private Bharat H2 Taskforce is critical for meeting the national ambitions for hydrogen commercialization and developing a domestic supply chain in India,\" Evanko said.  IH2A has also recommended creation of a nodal office for the hydrogen economy, as a specialised cell to work across all central ministries.  The India Hydrogen Alliance is an industry-led coalition of global and Indian companies committed to the creation of a hydrogen value-chain and economy in India.  IH2A works with private sector partners, the government and the public to ensure that costs of hydrogen production are brought down, and a local supply chain for hydrogen and industrial, power and transport sector demand is created. Lead members include Reliance Industries, JSW Steel, Chart Industries, and others.",

Also, India is targeting to increase its low-carbon power capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, and meet 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030.\"India's net-zero carbon emissions target of 2070 is momentous and praiseworthy, but highly ambitious to say the least,\" an ORF statement said.Structural changes and accelerants required to steer this transformation while balancing the twin goals of sustainability and development are detailed in the report 'Shaping Our Green Future: Pathways and Policies for a Net-Zero Transformation'.The report, ORF said, is a compendium of essays that offers possible solutions to several pressing questions and aims to provide a roadmap for India's transition to a decarbonised and green economy.\"The net-zero pathway will require committing to a legally binding net-zero target by a fixed year,\" said Jayant Sinha, Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Finance, in the report.A legally binding net-zero target and supportive government policies can lead to massive investments in green technologies and equipment.\"This, in turn, will thoroughly transform electricity generation, transportation, construction, real estate, agriculture, cement, steel, and many other industries - a largely private-sector transformation, driven by private-sector capital,\" he said.\"Massive green investments will likely drive fast economic growth and create high-quality jobs. Net Zero will prove to be a Net positive for India,\" he added.According to the quantitative modelling conducted on decarbonisation pathways for the Indian Economy, the GDP in 2050 is projected to be up by USD 406 billion in the net-zero scenario.In the process, 22 million more jobs will be created by 2030 and 43 million more jobs by 2050, ORF said.The monograph is published by ORF in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation, Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, National Investment &amp; Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and the Climate Policy Lab at The Fletcher School, Tufts University.It underlines three pillars for India's successful green transformation &ndash; Financing Net Zero, Deep Decarbonisation and a Just and Inclusive Transition.\"India's path to a prosperous low-carbon economy rests on three types of strategies: job creation in low-carbon industries, robust low-carbon economic growth, and peaking, and subsequently reducing, its GHG emissions in a way that does not disrupt development aspirations,\" said Kelly Sims Gallagher, Professor and Academic Dean at The Fletcher School, Tufts University.The net positive impact is mainly due to three factors: fresh, additional investments in new technologies and capacities; cheaper Renewable Energy, transport and maintenance and operation expenses; and a net increase in demand induced by consumption and employment, said Varun Aggarwal, Senior Program Associate &ndash; Climate, World Resources Institute India.The green transition must be driven by values of climate justice and inclusion, \"leaving no one behind,\" remarked Kate Hampton, CEO at the Children's Investment Fund Foundation.\"A wide range of stakeholders (allies and opponents alike) must come together to build alliances that further the integration of Just Transition principles in global efforts towards decarbonisation. A decarbonised world will truly make sense only if the new system is fair, equitable, and inclusive,\" Hampton said.Global cooperation and climate diplomacy will be instrumental in altering global climate change. There can only be one green new deal, and it will have to be global. Domestic green new deals are thus at best only of tangential assistance to the global fight against climate change. It is a new global green deal that is required, ORF said.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The global shipping industry is getting its biggest payday since 2008 as the combination of booming demand for goods and a global supply chain that&rsquo;s collapsing under the weight of Covid-19 drives freight prices ever higher.Whether its giant container ships stacked high with of 40-foot steel boxes, bulk carriers whose cavernous holds house thousands of tons of coal, or specialized vessels designed to pack in cars and trucks, earnings are soaring for ships of almost every type.With the merchant fleet hauling about 80% of world trade, the surge reaches into every corner of the economy. The boom back in 2008 brought with it a huge wave of new vessel orders, but the rally was quickly undone by a demand collapse when a financial crisis triggered the deepest global recession in decades.    This boom&rsquo;s causes are twofold -- an economic reopening after Covid that has spurred surging demand for goods and raw materials. Alongside that, the virus continues to cause disruption in global supply chains, choking up ports and delaying vessels, all of which is limiting how many are available to haul goods across oceans. That&rsquo;s left the majority of the shipping sector with bumper earnings in recent months.The bonanza is centered around container shipping -- where rates are spiraling ever higher to new records, but it is by no means limited to it. The shipping industry is posting its strongest daily earnings since 2008, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd., part of the world&rsquo;s biggest shipbroker. The only laggards are the oil and gas tanker markets, where more bearish forces are at play.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really sure the perfect storm covers it -- this is just spectacular,&rdquo; said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at trade group Bimco. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect spillover of a red-hot container shipping market to some of the other sectors.&rdquo;    Container shipping remains the star. It now costs $14,287 to haul a 40-foot steel box from China to Europe. That&rsquo;s up more than 500% on a year earlier and is pushing up the cost of transport everything from toys to bicycles to coffee.Those gains are already showing in the earnings of A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, the world&rsquo;s largest container line, which hiked its estimated profits this year by almost $5 billion last month. In a sign of just how profitable the industry has become, CMA CGM SA -- the world&rsquo;s third largest carrier -- said it is freezing its spot rates to preserve long-term client relationships. In other words, the company is turning away profit.Other SectorsWhile the demand for retail goods is lifting container markets, a recovering global economy is also churning through more raw materials -- boosting the revenues of bulk ships that carry industrial commodities. In that sector, earnings recently hit an 11-year high and are showing little sign of abating down the line with consumption expected to remain firm for the rest of the year.&ldquo;Strong demand for natural resources combined with Covid-related logistical disruptions&rdquo; are supporting spot and future freight rates, Ted Petrone, vice chairman at Navios Maritime Holdings, which owns a fleet of bulk carriers, said on an earnings call last week. &ldquo;Supply and demand fundamentals going forward remain extremely positive.&rdquo;Such is the extreme strength across shipping that some bulk carriers have even turned to carrying containers on their decks. Golden Ocean Group Ltd. is among the companies that said it&rsquo;s looking at the idea. While it could spur additional profits in an already windfall year for owners, its not without its risks as bulk carriers aren&rsquo;t designed to carry the giant boxes.&ldquo;It tells a story about the special situation we are in,&rdquo; in the container market, Golden Ocean&rsquo;s chief executive officer Ulrik Andersen said earlier this month.Tanker DoldrumsWhile for many shipping sectors Covid has brought a boom, for oil tankers it has meant loss-making trades for much of 2021 and owners effectively subsidizing the shipment of crude oil.With OPEC+ still keeping a chunk of supply offline there are too many ships and too few cargoes, keeping earnings depressed. That has burned one of the hottest trades in the sector at the start of the year -- bullish oil tankers positions on the hope of a summer surge in oil demand.Still, with on land oil inventories declining, analysts continue to anticipate a rebound. Rates could begin to move higher in October as stockpiles dwindle and demand for tankers grows, Pareto Securities analysts including Eirik Haavaldsen wrote in a note to clients.But for now, the tanker market remains the only blot for an industry where freight capacity ever tightening. The ClarkSea index, which tracks daily earnings across a diverse range of shipping sectors has already posted its longest run of monthly gains on record.Those bumper earnings are also being seen in more esoteric markets too. Car carriers now cost the most to hire since 2008. Rates for general cargo ships with heavy equipment are also surging, adding to a boom that is being led by container and bulk shipping.&ldquo;The charter rates reported in containers are crazy and it&rsquo;s the same for dry bulk,&rdquo; said Alexandra Alatari, a shipping analyst at Arrow Shipbroking Group. &ldquo;The fundamentals are so strong they support rates that would be the peak of any other year.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": "China is currently grappling with a huge power crunch as extreme weather, increasing demand for energy and strict limits on coal usage deliver a triple blow to the nation's electricity grid. This problem could last for months, straining the country's economic recovery and weighing on global trade.According to CNN, nearly a dozen Chinese provinces have said they are facing a power crunch in recent weeks, including some of the country's most important engines for economic growth.The Guangdong province, which is a manufacturing centre responsible for USD 1.7 trillion - more than 10 per cent of China's economic output - has been the rationing power for over a month. The restrictions have forced companies across the province to shut down for a few days per week.At least nine more provinces have said they are dealing with similar issues, including Yunnan, Guangxi and the manufacturing hub of Zhejiang, forcing regional authorities to announce power curbs across an area of China the size of the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan combined.The current situation signifies the worst energy shortage in China since 2011, when droughts and surging coal prices pushed 17 provinces or regions to curb electricity use. Even the country's National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday acknowledged that the power crunch even contributed to a slowdown in factory activity growth in China in June.The current power situation is also posing a challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping's push for a carbon-neutral China by 2060. The shortages could deliver a one-two punch that may knock China's fragile recovery off course, while spelling further trouble for global supply chains that are already struggling to cope.A shortage of electricity could reduce output across virtually every sector of the economy, including key construction and manufacturing industries. Such businesses used nearly 70 per cent of China's electricity last year, CNN reported citing the National Bureau of Statistics.Klaus Zenkel, chair of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in South China, said that as many as 80 of the chamber's member companies might have been affected by the government's orders to suspend operations for a few days a week, adding that domestic manufacturers have been forced to stagger production.\"It [the power shortage] might add to the shipping delays which can be felt around the globe,\" said Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group.Through the first five months of the year, power consumption in South China exceeded pre-pandemic levels -- up 21 per cent from the same period in 2019, according to the China Southern Power Grid, a big state-owned grid operator.Moreover, coal is still involved in generating some 60 per cent of the country's power. But the government is wary of that figure rising any higher -- and so has been trying to reduce coal consumption as it tries to achieve its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2060.A nationwide safety check before the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) 100th anniversary on Thursday has led to massive suspensions of coal mines across China, exacerbating the strains on the coal supply.Meanwhile, there's a huge strain on energy production. Renewable energy sources, such as hydropower, have been hobbled by drought.Gloystein said that trade tensions with Australia -- which in 2019 was responsible for nearly 60 per cent of China's thermal coal imports -- have created a strain, reported CNN.Beijing imposed trade barriers against Australian coal last year after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19.Power shortages are likely to continue for at least the next few months, especially as demand stays high in the hot summer months, according to Yan Qin, a lead-carbon analyst for Refinitiv, one of the world's largest providers of financial markets data and infrastructure.",

            "articleBody": "NEW YORK: The industry group representing oil and gas companies including Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp said on Thursday it supports a carbon price as one measure to mitigate climate change risk. Oil and gas trade group the American Petroleum Institute (API) said in a call with reporters that it endorsed a carbon-price policy to drive economy-wide solutions. \"We are not advocating a specific price,\" API President Mike Sommers said on the call announcing the group's new plan to address the risks of climate change. \"What we are saying is this is a framework through which API will advocate for specific principals.\" The API plans to advocate for sensible legislation that prices carbon across all economic sectors while avoiding regulatory duplication, Sommers said. API has started to shift some of its rhetoric on climate and carbon issue as the climate-focused Biden administration came to power. Still, Sommers did not commit to the industry reaching net-zero oil emissions in the next 15 years. \"There is no way that it is feasible without technologies that are not in the marketplace today,\" he said. President Joe Biden's administration is due to unveil a new economy-wide emissions reduction target for 2030 to comply with the Paris climate agreement by April 22, when Biden convenes world leaders on climate change. Some Republicans spoke out against the API's inclusion of a carbon price. \"We need serious American solutions that are based on American innovation, resources and ingenuity that reduce costs and create jobs, not a cop-out approach to appease the radical left,\" said U.S. Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana, the senior Republican on the House Select Climate Committee. A carbon tax would increase the cost of goods from food to fuel for all Americans, Graves said. ",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The world is likely to see peak demand for petrol by the late 2020s and for diesel by 2035, but auto fuels will continue to see growth in India as the economy expands, a senior petroleum ministry official said Thursday.Speaking at the 'India Chem 2021' conference, Sunil Kumar, Joint Secretary (Refinery), Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, said the country will see different energy systems co-exist through the next few decades as demand is expected to remain robust.Fuel demand in years to come will be impacted by factors such as the availability of substitute fuels, the advent of electric vehicles (EVs) and the development of renewable fuels.\"Globally, demand for gasoline (petrol) is expected to peak in the late 2020s and of diesel by 2035,\" he said. However, in India, different energy systems, including fossil fuel, will co-exist over the next few decades.\"Demand for petrol and diesel in India is expected to remain robust in the foreseeable future... at least up to 2040 because our pie is increasing,\" he said. \"India's demand for petrol and diesel will continue to rise despite new sources.\"The time till the demand peaks can be used by the country and the oil industry to prepare for future where crude oil can be converted directly into chemicals instead of the current practice of first it getting turned into fuel.\"Refining and petrochemicals have to have a synergy by sharing of streams and there is a lot of thinking and planning in this regard,\" he said. \"Changing market dynamics clearly indicate that integration of refining and petrochemicals is more of a necessity than a choice\" and is needed for improving margins and remaining competitive.The International Energy Agency (IEA), he said, sees the biggest growth coming from petrochemical feedstock such as ethane, LPG, naphtha, and jet fuel. \"It is estimated these products will account for around 90 per cent of the net increase in total oil product demand through 2040. This contrasts trends from 2000 when gasoline and diesel provided for two-third of growth in oil product.\"Global petrochemical is growing at nearly 4 per cent per year, he said. But, India is 40 per cent import-dependent on meeting its chemical needs.India spent Rs 94,000 crore on the import of 35 petrochemicals alone in 2019-20. \"This is when our per capita consumption is only 12 kg against the world average of 37 kg,\" he said, adding as the standard of living rises, the demand for chemicals and petrochemicals will continue to grow.\"And it is assumed as a thumb rule that consumption of petrochemical products grows at 1.5 times that of the growth of India's GDP,\" he said. \"It is believed that India needs a cracker (to produce petrochemicals) every year in the foreseeable future for at least 10 years.\"Kumar said India's oil refining capacity will rise from 249 million tonnes per annum now to 300 million tonnes by 2024-25 and 443 million tonnes by 2030.\"Oil demand is expected to grow from 4.4 to 8.7 million barrels per day ie 435 million tonnes per annum. Part of this requirement will also come from the production of petrochemicals as newer refineries are built with higher integration with petrochemicals,\" he said.The petrochemical intensity of the Indian refining industry is expected to increase from 3.5 per cent to 7 per cent by 2030 as all new refineries and expansion are planning to have 15-20 per cent of petrochemical exposure, he said.\"India dependent on imports for a variety of specialised petrochemical products. Production of such niche petrochemicals need to be encouraged through fiscal incentives,\" he said. \"So, in order to become Aatmanirbhar in petrochemical, we need to develop large scale infrastructure for import of alternate feedstock like ethane, LNG, condensate etc to augment available of feedstock.\" ",

According to data from the power ministry, the peak power demand met (the highest supply in a day) during January last year stood at 170.97 GW.  The rising power demand shows revival in economic activities leading to higher commercial and industrial demand, which was affected due to the pandemic.  The government had imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25, 2020 to contain the spread of COVID-19.  Power demand started declining from April as economic activities were disrupted due to COVID-19. The pandemic affected power demand for five months in a row from April to August 2020.  The demand recovered from September onwards. Peak power demand met grew at 1.7 per cent in September, 3.4 per cent in October, 3.5 per cent in November and 7.3 per cent in December.",

            "articleBody": "Washington:Joe Biden has said he will return the United States to the Paris climate accord as soon as he takes office, and is also widely expected to block an oil pipeline project in a move that threatens to strain ties with Canada. And that's just the start. Experts say that after four years under Donald Trump, the Democrat will have to rebuild the credibility the US lost in the eyes of the international community, by setting concrete goals for its emissions reductions on the path to net zero by 2050. Next, he'll need to realize his $2 trillion climate plan, which would place green action at the heart of the economy and its recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, to ensure a long term shift that can't be rapidly undone under any future Republican president. \"I think it's important that the US shows that it means businesses at home,\" David Waskow of the World Resources Institute told AFP.  The WRI is advocating for the US to set a 45-50 percent reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Biden has also vowed to convene the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within 100 days of his inauguration on Wednesday. There are a number of possible steps the incoming leader could take right away to roll back environmental harms done by his predecessor.  These include reentering the Paris agreement -- a 30-day process that begins when the US sends a letter to the UN -- and scrapping the Keystone XL pipeline connecting the Alberta oil sands to coastal refineries in Texas. The federal government has additional tools at its disposal, with Biden campaign spokesman Jamal Brown telling Vox that the incoming administration will move to impose strict methane limits on new oil and gas infrastructure. Federal contracts will also be geared toward renewable energy in infrastructure, and zero-emissions vehicles. The Trump administration took an axe to a host of environmental regulations -- from car emissions standards to industrial air pollution, which Biden can quickly undo, while unveiling new standards like protecting 30 percent of America's land and water by 2030. While former secretary of state John Kerry will lead US climate negotiations abroad, the domestic front will be headed up by Gina McCarthy who Biden has picked as the first national climate adviser.  - Infrastructure plan -   Biden will present to Congress next month an infrastructure-focused \"Build Back Better Recovery Plan\" -- separate from the $1.9 trillion Covid package he's seeking. This is where things can potentially become more tricky, given the Democratic Party's razor thin control of the Senate.  The package is expected to be similar to the $2 trillion green climate plan Biden outlined during his campaign.  It promises \"to meet the climate crisis, build a clean energy economy, address environmental injustice, and create millions of good-paying union jobs\" -- in other words the \"Green New Deal\" in concept, if not specifically in name. \"The challenge will be to bring Republicans on board with a clean energy infrastructure package that could systematically reduce American emissions,\" Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser to former president Bill Clinton now with the Progressive Policy Institute told AFP. Bledsoe predicted Biden will initially be expected to try to work with Republican colleagues to reach the 60-vote threshold required to pass most legislation -- though if that doesn't pan out there are processes to pass laws with a simple 51-vote majority. \"Embedding climate action fully into the way in which we build the economy, the way in which we generate jobs and ensure an equitable recovery, all of that is what will make this something long lasting,\" said Waskow.  The political and technical challenges are great, and there will be pressure on Biden not to cut fossil fuels loose too quickly -- particularly natural gas, which has helped the US lower its net emissions for a decade and is seen as a crucial \"bridging\" energy.  But it also comes at a time of record-high recognition of climate change and desire for action among the US public.  A survey conducted after the election and published last week by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found a majority of voters from both parties support policies to reduce carbon pollution and promote clean energy. Fifty-three percent of voters said that global warming should be a high or very high priority for the president and Congress, while 66 percent said that developing sources of clean energy should be a high or very high priority. ia/bgs",

            "articleBody": "MILAN: The Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which will bring Azeri gas into Italy, has kicked off commercial operations, more than four years after construction work first began, TAP said. The pipeline, whose shareholders include Snam and BP, said it had begun to offer capacity along the 878 km line which will be able to carry 10 billion cubic metres of gas per year. TAP is the final leg of a $40 billion project named the Southern Gas Corridor, which is a cornerstone of the European Union's energy security policy to wean the bloc off Russian gas. Opposition from local and environmental groups had caused delays to the 4.5 billion euro ($5 billion) pipeline but first gas is now expected to start flowing by the end of this year. \"It is the first delivery of contracted Azerbaijani gas beyond Turkey, it provides a fourth gas import pipeline corridor for the EU, it boosts diversification and energy security,\" said Wood Mackenzie Research Director Murray Douglas. TAP, work on which started in 2016, was built to be able to transport double its initial capacity. But the transition towards cleaner renewable fuels to de-carbonise economies has raised questions about demand and costs. \"More Azerbaijani gas had been the initial hope to fill TAP expansion, but this is looking increasingly unlikely because of challenging project economics and better-positioned supply alternatives, including Russian gas,\" Douglas said. Besides Snam and BP, TAP AG shareholders include Azerbaijan's SOCAR, Fluxys, Enagas and Axpo. ",

Nine of the tracked 15 non-financial high-frequency indicators recorded growth last month, while five posted a narrower year-on-year (YoY) contraction. The parameters which recorded an improvement in September include an increase in GST e-way bills and higher consumption of electricity, petrol and diesel.&ldquo;The improvement in some of the other indicators, such as auto output, reflects a combination of pent-up demand, healthy rural sentiment, and inventory build-up, ahead of the upcoming festive season. This trend may persist in the coming one to two months, before settling at more sedate levels after the festive season is over,&rdquo; said ICRA principal economist Aditi Nayar.Electricity generation turned around to a growth of 4.2 per cent in September from the 3.3 per cent YoY decline in the previous month of August, reflecting a broader economic recovery as well as a favourable base. &ldquo;The healthy 9.6 per cent increase in the generation of GST e-way bills on a YoY basis in September, in contrast to the contraction of 3.5 per cent in August, signals a wider revival in economic activity,&rdquo; Nayar added.Aggregate auto production jumped 11.7 per cent in September, after a sustained year-on-year contraction for the previous 22 months. However, retail sales were less positive with vehicle registrations below the pre-Covid levels last month, across most automotive segments.The monthly indicators tracked by ICRA include the production of passenger vehicles, motorcycles, and scooters. It also tracks vehicle registrations, coal output, electricity generation, non-oil merchandise exports, ports cargo traffic, rail freight traffic, generation of GST e-way bills, domestic airlines passenger traffic, consumption of ATF, petrol &amp; diesel, aggregate deposits and non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks.",

            "articleBody": "LONDON: World oil demand will plateau in the late 2030s and could by then have begun to decline, OPEC said on Thursday, in a major shift for the producer group that reflects the lasting impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy and consumer habits. The prediction from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, made in its 2020 World Oil Outlook, comes amid a growing number of other forecasts that the pandemic may prove the tipping point for peak oil demand. Oil use will rise to 107.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2030 from 90.7 million bpd in 2020, OPEC said, 1.1 million bpd below its 2030 forecast last year and over 10 million bpd below its 2007 prediction of 2030 demand. \"Global oil demand will grow at relatively healthy rates during the first part of the forecast period before demand plateaus during the second half,\" said the report, which looks at the 2019-2045 timespan. \"Future demand will likely remain persistently below past projections due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19-related shutdowns and their impact on the global economy and consumer behaviour.\" While oil use to fuel cars, trucks and industry will rebound as economies recover, OPEC voiced concern future growth may be partly offset by factors like a post-pandemic shift to homeworking and teleconferencing over commuting, as well as efficiency improvements and a shift to electric cars. Even before the pandemic, rising climate activism in the West and widening use of alternative fuels were putting the strength of long-term oil demand under more scrutiny. Despite scaling back its forecasts, OPEC had still seen growth. This year, it also sees potential for demand to begin to decline after 2030 given developments like a faster adoption of electric cars, more fuel efficiency and a larger reduction in business and leisure travel after the pandemic. This scenario, the Accelerated Policy and Technology case, is not based on any major technological breakthroughs, OPEC said, nor does it represent the full demand reduction possible. \"There is ample scope for far larger implementation of energy efficiency measures, which could potentially depress future oil demand to much lower levels,\" OPEC said.  NEAR-TERM DEMAND REBOUND OPEC has been concerned the pandemic could hit demand permanently, which current and former officials say could pressure oil prices and challenge its efforts to balance the market. This year OPEC, with Russia and other allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, agreed record output cuts of 9.7 million bpd, the equivalent of 10% of global supply. OPEC still sees oil demand rising in the next few years, unlike some others. Oil use will jump to 97.7 million bpd next year, reach 99.8 million bpd in 2022 - above the 2019 level - and grow to 102.6 million bpd by 2024, it predicts. The 2024 figure is less than last year's forecast. OPEC forecast it will pump more in 2021 than this year's expected 30.7 million bpd, but rising supply from the United States and other outside producers means OPEC output in 2025 will likely be 33.2 million bpd, below 2019's level, it said. Longer term, its reference case is for oil demand to reach 109.3 million bpd in 2040 and decline slightly to 109.1 million bpd by 2045. OPEC said the pandemic had accelerated a trend for lower oil use in industrialised Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and non-OECD growth. Electric cars are gaining share and there is \"a constant improvement in battery economics\", OPEC said. They will account for over 27% of new cars globally by 2045. Nonetheless, OPEC still hopes to boost production in coming decades as rival output declines. \"Oil will continue to account for the largest share of the energy mix by 2045,\" OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo wrote in the foreword to the report.",

The world's largest oil exporter is facing its worst ever economic decline after the COVID-19 pandemic curbed global crude demand and measures to contain the coronavirus hurt domestic demand. \"The private sector and the government sector recorded a negative growth rate of 10.1 per centand 3.5 per cent, respectively,\" said the General Authority for Statistics. In the first quarter, Saudi Arabia posted a 1 per centeconomic contraction, as that only captured part of the oil price collapse and the pandemic impact, which escalated in March. The non-oil sector, which is the focus of Saudi reforms aimed at diversifying the economy away from crude revenues, was hit the hardest in the second quarter, shrinking by 8.2 per cent, while the oil sector declined by 5.3 per cent, the statistics authority said.",

We have proved our opponents wrong,\" Boshoff said.While construction is still underway on the project which includes a purpose built rail line, dam and airfield, Boshoff said the temporary jobs involved were vital to sustaining the economy through Covid-19.\"Mining has cushioned the Queensland and Western Australian economies from the worst of the devastating economic impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns and we are proud to be a part of that,\" he said.The Stop Adani movement became a household name both in Australia and abroad, due to the mine's planning and construction taking place against a backdrop of rising climate change concern.Additionally the project's proximity to Australia's treasured Great Barrier Reef means it will drive an increase in shipping traffic through the already sensitive area.According to the activist group, coal extracted by the mine, most of which will go to India, will contribute 4.6 billion tonnes of carbon pollution to the atmosphere.\"We are looking forward to the day next year when we can celebrate our success with our Queensland partners and employees, while watching the first shipment of coal being exported. Until then, it remains full speed ahead on construction,\" Boshoff said.",

Gandhi's accusations came in the backdrop of the government selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake in India's second-largest fuel retailer and third-biggest oil refiner BPCL. \"Today, the country is facing many Modi government-manufactured disasters, among which is unnecessary privatisation. The youth need jobs but the Modi government is destroying employment and capital by privatising PSUs,\" he tweeted in Hindi. \"Who is benefitting? It is only doing development of a few \"friends\", who are close to Modi. Stop Privatisation Save Government Jobs,\" Gandhi tweeted. Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the Modi government has proved itself as one which is \"infected by political as well as economic bankruptcy\". \"While China is registering growth of 3.8 per cent of their economy, India has been contracted by -23.9 per cent. Modinomics has fallen flat, for the survival of economics Jingoism can not be a remedy, Sh Narendra Modi Ji, you should talk to former PM Sh Manmohan Singh Ji and listen to him patiently,\" he tweeted. Former finance minister P Chidambaram also said news reports say that the State Bank of India plans to implement a VRS scheme as an 'economy measure'. \"In normal times the plan would be debatable. In these abnormal times, when the economy has collapsed and jobs are scarce, it is cruel,\" he said. The Congress leader said if India's biggest lender has to shed jobs, imagine what other big employers and MSMEs are doing. \"The plan is ostensibly voluntary but we know that subtle pressure will be brought on the employees that the Bank wants to get rid of. If the current rules provide for genuine voluntary retirement, why announce a new plan and give out an exact number like 30,190,\" he tweeted.",

            "articleBody": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba/OTTAWA: Canada's main crude-producing province Alberta looks to use hydrogen to fuel expansion of its oil sands without increasing emissions, even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promises strong action against climate change, officials with the two governments said. Alberta will announce no later than October a strategy to develop \"blue hydrogen\" as a cleaner alternative to using natural gas to extract crude at steam-driven oil sands sites, Associate Minister of Natural Gas Dale Nally told Reuters in an interview. Deploying cleaner feedstock will allow Alberta to produce more oil without exceeding its 100 megatonne annual limit on provincial carbon emissions, Nally said. \"Hydrogen will allow us to continue to move the bar and reduce the carbon intensity of the oil sands until you get to a point where there is no difference in (greenhouse gases) in conventional oil and oil sands,\" he said, adding that Alberta's hydrogen plan is synchronized with Ottawa's. \"Reducing the carbon intensity of the oil sands would allow of course more expansion.\" Blue hydrogen is produced from natural gas, with the carbon byproduct captured and stored. A green agenda to be launched by Trudeau this month is expected to map out a course to the 2050 zero-emissions target, and likely to include a strategy describing hydrogen as a \"net-zero moon shot\" for the petroleum sector, said a government source familiar with the federal plan. According to a draft 14-page summary of the federal strategy seen by Reuters, hydrogen will leverage the fossil fuel sector's \"expertise and infrastructure... to decarbonize and diversify into a leading global clean fuels exporter,\" the document reads. \"If (Alberta) is staying under their 100 megatonne cap, how they choose to do that, or how they choose to employ hydrogen to do that, isn't really our concern,\" said the government source. \"Cleaning up the oil and gas sector is going to be a necessary event if we are going to meet our 2050 target\" of net-zero emissions, the source added. Oil sands growth has slowed, with Teck Resources scrapping plans for a new mine this year and the pandemic crushing oil demand, resulting in temporary production cuts. The hydrogen plans raise flags for some environmental groups familiar with the federal strategy. Some major investors like Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund have shunned oil sands companies because of their tarnished environmental reputation. \"Hydrogen is like a lifeboat for (the oil sands),\" said Julia Levin, climate and energy program manager at Environmental Defence, about the federal strategy. \"It's a significant fossil fuel subsidy at a time when we're making no progress on eliminating fossil fuels.\" The federal government's draft plan - three years in the making - says several provinces could produce hydrogen, some using renewable energy, and by 2050 the industry could create 100,000 jobs, generate more than C$5 billion in annual revenue and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 100 megatonnes. Some say hydrogen is not likely to transform the oil industry anytime soon. \"We still don't have a good understanding of the economics, how much it's going to cost and what we're going to use it for,\" said Allan Fogwill, chief executive of the Canadian Energy Research Institute.

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The eight core sectors contracted for the fifth month in a row in July, dragged down by a sharp contraction in steel, cement, refinery products and natural gas. But the pace of decline narrowed during the month.The key sector &mdash; which spans coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertiliser, steel, cement and electricity &mdash; accounts for nearly 41% of the index of industrial production and is a key influence on the outcome of factory output data, which will be released later in the month.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Monday showed the sector declined 9.6% in July, slower than the 12.9% contraction in the previous month. The sector had grown 2.6% in July 2019.Fertiliser was the only sector that recorded growth, on the back of the demand from the farm sector &mdash; expected to be the only bright spot for the economy, which is estimated to post a sharp contraction in 2020-21. The remaining seven sectors all posted contractions.The industrial sector has been in the midst of a sharp slowdown and the lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus has severely hurt the segment. &ldquo;The mild improvement in the pace of contraction in the eight core sectors in July 2020 trailed our expectation (-7.2%), adding to the view that the momentum of the recovery stalled in that month, partly on account of the localised lockdowns. In particular, the performance of refinery products and cement worsened in July 2020 as compared to the previous month, highlighting the unevenness in the sectoral recovery patterns,&rdquo; said Aditu Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.The steel sector witnessed the sharpest slump, declining 16.4% during the month followed by refinery products which contracted 13.9%. The unlocking of the economy which has started, may help restore some fresh life but economists say authorities will need to step up help for the sector battered by the pandemicinduced lockdown.&ldquo;We continue to expect a multi-speed recovery, characterised by regional and sectoral unevenness,&rdquo; said Nayar.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: As India reported a 23.9 per cent contraction in GDP for the first quarter of FY 2020-21 on Monday, Chief Economic Adviser K.V. Subramanian said the slump in the economy has been in line with the global economy as it is going through a \"once in a one and half century\" event.Addressing the media after the announcement of the GDP numbers, Subramanian said that the negative growth rate in GDP was in expected lines as India went through a complete lockdown during the April-June quarter as other countries.He attributed the dismal economic performance in the last quarter to \"an exogenous shock that has been felt globally\", referring to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown.\"As the world economic outlook has highlighted the fraction of countries where the GDP per capita would decrease is the highest since 1870. So once in one and a half century event which is what we are going through,\" the CEA said.\"India was also in a lockdown all through the April to June quarter with the majority of economic activities being restricted. This dirft is along expected lines,\" he added.Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) showed that India's GDP for the quarter ended June 2020-21, contracted by 23.9 per cent. Though not comparable, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had grown by 5.2 per cent in the corresponding quarter of FY2019-20. In the quarter just preceding Q1FY21, the economic growth was at 3.1 per cent.The country had observed mobility restrictions as mandated under the lockdown measures for the better part of the first quarter of FY21.AIt was only on June 1 that partial unlock measures were implemented.Subramanian also cited the Oxford University Index to suggest that Indian lockdown was 15 per cent more stringent than in the UK. \"The UK contracted by 22 per cent and given the higher intensity, the GDP contraction in India is on the expected lines,\" he said.But amidst the gloom, the CEA said that greenshoots of a recovery were already visible and India is already experiencing a V shaped recovery after the unlocks have been announced.He said that core sector growth, which declined by 38 per cent in April, progressively reduced the decline to 22 per cent in May, 13 per cent in June and 9.6 per cent in July. Similarly, railway freight traffic which is a good indicator of economic activity, stood at 95 per cent of the previous years levels in July and in August it has actually grown by 6 per cent in first 26 days of the month. E-way bill in August is also almost the same as last year at 99.8 per cent despite some local lockdowns.\"So overall there is clearly a V shaped recovery. Agriculture sector, which has grown by 3.4 per cent, is reflective of the several reform measures announced by the government. Rural inflation is higher than urban inflation, which captures that rural demand is picking up,\" Subramanian said.\"In sum this decline is expected given the lockdown which happened globally and india is definitely experiencing a V shaped recovery. So we should expect better performance in subsequent quarters,\" he said.",

            "articleBody": "MADRID: Europe's long goodbye to coal is speeding up, in a transition smoothed by the rise of wind and solar power and energy policy that has priced the fossil fuel out of many markets, according to data released on Wednesday. Centuries after powering Europe's industrial revolution, coal cannot compete with less polluting fuels to generate electricity, prompting governments and companies to close mines and plants. Renewable sources of power have taken over for the first time in 2020, generating 40 per cent of European Union electricity, while fossil fuels generated 34 per cent, independent think-tank Ember said in a half-yearly report. In Spain, coal generation fell 58 per cent in the first six months of the year, even before half its remaining plants closed in June as they no longer complied with EU emissions rules. Ember's findings were reinforced by Global Energy Monitor researchers, who predicted a record rate of closures globally in 2020. The pace of plant closures in Spain, with 69 per cent of the entire fleet to be shuttered between 2020 and 2021, has no precedent, Global Energy Monitor program director Christine Shearer said. \"The fact that such a rapid decline has taken place indicates the increasingly uncompetitive economics of coal power,\" Shearer said. The COVID-19 outbreak depressed power demand, further reducing coal consumption, the analysts said. In Portugal, coal generation fell 95 per cent in the first half of 2020, Ember said. Last week major utility EDP brought forward its Iberian plant closures to 2021, after writing down their value last year. The Netherlands, Austria and France all saw reductions of more than 50 per cent. Sweden and Austria closed their last plants in March. In Germany coal generation fell 39 per cent, taking it for the first time below Poland, which now generates as much electricity from coal as the EU's remaining 25 countries put together. All five EU countries with no clear closure plan for their plants are in central and eastern Europe, consultancy Energy Aspects said in a separate report this month, predicting Poland's coal reliance will cause tension in the bloc.

Project economics vary across the country, depending on the cost of land and the intensity of sunlight or wind.Sumant Sinha-led Renew Power&rsquo;s aggressive expansion is part of the growing corporate interest in the sector in which Gautam Adani is also expanding his presence with the aim of becoming the world&rsquo;s biggest renewable energy company with a capacity of 25,000 MW.\"This year despite the impact of Covid-19, the government has been actively bringing out new bids in the renewable energy space and companies have responded enthusiastically,\" Renew Power chairman and managing director Sumant Sinha told ET.Goldman Sach&rsquo;s MD of merchant banking division Michael Bruun said growth prospects are exciting. \"We are excited about our investment in Renew and the journey ahead as the company continues to grow and becomes more integrated across the value chain,\" Bruun said.Goldman Sachs holds 48.6% stake in Renew Power and has backed the company for a long time. Renew Power has also raised debt and equity from other major global investors including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, JERA and Global Environment Fund. Since its inception 10 years ago, the company has seen foreign direct investment of over $1.4 billion from various investors. Renew already has the country&rsquo;s largest operation capacity of 5,600 MW, which along with capacity in the pipeline adds up to 10,000 MW.In May, Renew won a first of its kind 400 MW round-the-clock (RTC) bid, which promises an 80% plant load factor (PLF) annually at Rs 2.90 per unit. To ensure the PLF efficiency, Renew is likely to set up a plant with capacity higher than 1 GW, bringing the total to 2 GW in the past six months. These will be online in the next two years, Sinha said.Out of the 2 GW, 800 MW worth of bids were won during the Covid-19 period.The RTC bid will allow RE companies to provide stable power to the grids, plugging a major challenge against coal-based power plants and other conventional energy sources.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: ReNew Power has given up to 12 per cent salary hikes and bonuses to all its employees amid COVID-19-induced lockdown, probably making an exception among its peers. Some clean energy firms in private sector have given hikes to employees but that is not across the board and is very nominal for lower income categories (like below Rs 10 lakh per annum), as per industry sources. \"2020 has been a challenging year for everyone. ReNew power also had its fair share of challenges but ReNewers have faced adversity with determination and have ensured continuation of operations. \"In these difficult times, we consciously decided to go ahead with salary hikes and bonuses to ensure our employees do not face any hardship on this front. With many sectors of the economy slowly recovering, I expect the Indian economy to be back on the growth path soon,\" Sumant Sinha, Chairman and Managing Director of ReNew Power told . ReNew Power, India's leading renewable energy company, has given out salary increments to its over 1,100 employees across locations despite the prevailing economic slowdown. The average increments given in the company range from 5 to 12 per cent, Sinha said. Apart from salary hikes the annual performance linked bonus has also been paid out by ReNew to its employees. The company has also gone ahead with promotions for its executives, effective April 2020. ReNew Power announced that it will honour all the placement offers made at various academic institutions earlier in the year and also continue with new recruitment in various verticals as per its hiring plans. Additionally not only is the company planning to protect the jobs of its existing employees but is in fact looking to augment its employee strength by 10 per cent in the current year and will utilise digital on boarding tools to induct employees in the view of various lockdown related restrictions. ReNew power's announcement to hike salaries and continue recruitment came at a time when many sectors of the economy are seeing job losses and pay cuts due to the impact of the lockdown imposed to contain COVID-19 pandemic. ReNew Power maintained its operations to supply power through its various sites during the lockdown. During the last couple of months, ReNew has bid and won a historic tender to supply 400 MW of energy Round-The-Clock, using only renewables. It also recently bagged another bid for 400 MW in SECI's ISTS auction (Solar Energy Corporation of India Inter state transmission system).  It has recently announced the acquisition of Climate Connect, an Artificial intelligence and machine learning company. The Climate Connect acquisition expands the portfolio of services, it can provide. As the Indian economy gets back on track, ReNew is ramping up construction activity at its under-construction project sites, which will further provide employment to skilled labourers.",

            "articleBody": "Panaji: A sharp jump in the proposed electricity tariffs approved by the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) has raised eyebrows within Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI). The jump, along with the Rs 152.09 crore difference in the estimates prepared by the electricity department and the JERC&rsquo;s projected expenditure figures, prompted some within the industry body to question if JERC was trying to pave the way for private players to enter the power sector.The state has not notified the JERC&rsquo;s recommended power tariffs and GCCI president Manoj Caculo, in a letter to power minister Nilesh Cabral, has welcomed the decision. &ldquo;Electricity department-Goa (ED-Goa) had proposed an increase of 3.1 per cent in their tariff petition, but JERC, in its tariff order, proposed a hike of 5.31  per cent by not accepting ED-Goa&rsquo;s proposal in respect of notional expenses,&rdquo; said Caculo. As an example, the electricity department had proposed to increase the tariff for high tension 11/33kV connections from Rs 4.50 per unit to 4.60 per unit but JERC hiked the tariff to 4.80 per unit. Similarly, while the electricity department projected the interest on loans at 30.4 crore, the JERC disagreed and hiked the estimates to Rs 98.8 crore. JERC&rsquo;s expenditure projections &ldquo;It is surprising that the JERC is increasing the expenditure estimates. And if the estimates increase then to meet the estimates, the tariff must also increase,&rdquo; said M Durairaj said in an earlier interaction with the media.Officials at GCCI said that if Goa electricity department is privatised, it would be easy for private operators to increase their revenue. Durairaj also said that the Goa government could be tempted to notify the higher tariffs in order to meet the drop in revenues caused due to the lockdown. GCCI has made some recommendations to the electricity department to address power reliability issues in the state. ",

            "articleBody": "  NEW DELHI: Opening of the coal sector to private players will generate jobs, reduce dependence on fuel import, stimulate the economy and catalyse the country's path towards a USD 5-trillion economy, the industry said on Thursday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the virtual auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, which is expected to garner Rs 33,000 crore of capital investment in the country over next 5-7 years.  Industry body Ficci said that commercial mining will modernise the coal sector.  \"This landmark reform will unlock country's natural resources,\" Ficci President Sangita Reddy said.  CII stated that the de-nationalisation of the coal sector will help in bringing new investment and advancement in technology.  \"It is a watershed moment in the history of the coal sector for India. The step reflects the GOI's firm commitment in moving towards AtmaNirbhar Bharat. It is also important to look at important aspects as quality of coal and coal prices at the outset so that the sector is streamlined in terms of policy and regulations to support India's vision,\" CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said in a statement.  The auction of coal mines for commercial mining and relaxation of FDI in the coal sector will create a lot of interest for companies engaged in the coal mining and associated activities such as mine developer and operator (MDO) sectors, Arvind Sharma, Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas &amp; Co said.  The timing of launch of the commercial mining is critical since the reserves must be utilised to build the country before the focus shifts to entirely to renewable energy, he said.  Stating that launch of auction process for commercial coal mining was a transformative reform in the energy sector, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas Partner Ramanuj Kumar pointed out that environmental concerns and delays are likely to result in muted interest from international investors.  \"We expect strong interest from domestic mining and power companies since bid terms are attractive as compared to other mineral auctions,\" Kumar said.  Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran was of the view that with reforms like this, the mining sector can easily contribute 5 per cent to India's GDP.  Commercial mining will be a very successful initiative and it will generate huge amount of growth, significantly reduce imports and create lots of jobs, he said.  Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal also said that commercial mining will create infrastructure and people in the backward region will get employment.  \"The bold decision taken by the Prime Minister to open up coal sector will result in massive job creation and generate a lot of revenue as we can replace coal import worth Rs 80,000 crore every year,\" he said in a tweet.  \"This will also support the industry to bring down the cost. In these difficult times, it will be very useful for the growth of the country,\" he tweeted.  The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said while India's coal demand is likely to increase in the next decade, the investment in green-field projects to expand production capacity must be examined more carefully.  \"Import dependence is not a bad thing, especially if it defers or removes investment needs into new mines in pristine environments in the country, CEEW Research Fellow Karthik Ganesan said.  The government's attempt to promote coal-gasification is also puzzling, he said, adding that from a climate standpoint, it defeats India's efforts to rein in CO2 emissions.  \"Power generation and industrial applications that use syngas are 40 per cent - 80 per cent higher in CO2 emissions, as compared to those that use natural gas. Syngas is not cheap either. Data from the IEA suggests we might as well unlock deep-water gas instead of pursuing syngas, given the delivered price could be 4 - 6 USD/mmbtu higher than conventional gas.  \"Also, while the use of syngas reduces air pollution outcomes, as compared to burning coal, it comes with a significant risk of polluting underground water resources with phenols and aromatic compounds that are generated in-situ and that could migrate out of the generation wells,\" Ganesan said.  In this auction process, 41 coal mines are on offer which includes fully explored and partially explored mines. These include 4 coking coal mines which are fully explored mines. These coal mines are located in states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha.  The auction process will be a two-stage tender process with technical and financial bidding.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Moody's Investors Service on Friday said India's economy is expected to contract for the first time in more than four decades saying economic damage owing to the coronavirus-induced lockdown will be significant with lower consumption and sluggish business activity.Even before the coronavirus outbreak, Indian economy already was growing at its slowest pace in six years and with the stimulus measures announced by the government falling short of expectations, the disruptions are likely to be greater.\"We now expect India's growth to register a real GDP contraction for the fiscal year ending in March 2021 (fiscal 2020-21), from our earlier projection of zero growth,\" it said in a research note.It however expected the economy to see a recovery in fiscal 2021-22, somewhat stronger than its earlier forecast of 6.6 per cent growth.\"Economic damage as a result of India's continued coronavirus lockdown, now extended through May 31, will likely be significant and reflect the country's inherent economic vulnerabilities and fiscal constraints, with wide-ranging effects on both the public and private sectors,\" it said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus on March 25. It has been extended thrice, with the fourth phase set to expire on May 31.The lockdown has presented a challenge to the country's unorganised sector, which accounts for more than half of GDP.The first phase of lockdown largely affected low-income households and daily wage earners.Restrictions have been eased gradually in the subsequent phases as the government attempts to restore normalcy to economic activities. In the current fourth phase, states have autonomy to decide on the delineation of areas into red, orange and green zones depending on outbreak intensity.With India now in the fourth phase of its coronaviorius lockdown, the disruption to incomes will likely keep household consumption under pressure for the rest of the year, it said.While the government's cumulative policy response brings total headline stimulus announcements to a sizeable Rs 20.9 lakh crore, or 10 per cent of GDP, and includes a range of support measures that will bring a degree of relief to rural households and small businesses, the measures are unlikely to offset lower consumption and sluggish business activity resulting from the extended lockdown.\"Direct fiscal stimulus spending by the government is likely to be in the range of 1-2 per cent of GDP, as most of the government's plans take the form of credit guarantees or are aimed at easing liquidity concerns for affected sectors,\" Moody's said. \"The quantum of direct fiscal spending falls short of our expectations and is unlikely to provide much additional impetus to growth.\"Moody's said the economic shock from the lockdowns and fiscal policy response is expected to result in significant slippage from the central government's budgeted deficit target of 3.5 per cent of GDP for fiscal 2020-21.While the direct fiscal spending by the government in the stimulus is limited to 1-2 per cent of GDP, weaker overall revenue and disinvestment receipts (from government asset sales), will likely drive up the deficit in fiscal 2020-21, it said.Before the start of the lockdown in March, activity indicators such as passenger car sales (a proxy for urban demand) and motorcycle sales (a proxy for rural demand) already pointed to weak household demand.Also, inflation had outstripped nominal wage growth, reducing the purchasing power of rural households.Preliminary estimates from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy indicate that the national unemployment rate surged to more than 20 per cent within a week of the lockdown, a nearly threefold increase compared with the rate before the pandemic.\"Even as restrictions gradually ease, disruption to incomes will likely weigh on household consumption for the rest of the year. Lower consumption and sluggish business activity will result in a sharp decline in India's economic growth in fiscal 2020-21,\" it said.The rating agency expected the economic shock from the coronavirus and the fiscal policy response to result in significant slippage from the central government's budgeted deficit target for fiscal 2020-21.Stating that asset quality of financial institutions will deteriorate and finance companies' liquidity will be under pressure, it said asset quality will deteriorate significantly, although it will not be visible in near-term reported numbers because of regulatory forbearance.Automobile, oil and gas, and mining companies will bear the brunt of the downturn. Corporate sectors that are sensitive to consumer demand, sentiment and supply chain disruptions will be particularly hard hit. Companies that provide essential goods and services have low exposure, it said.Weaker demand, it said, will weigh on power and transport sectors. \"Power demand will likely weaken substantially in fiscal 2020-21. The transportation sector will be under severe stress because of the decline in consumer demand and travel restrictions,\" it noted.The economic slowdown will hit the performance of commercial vehicle and micro, small and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) loans. \"The effects will be more significantly negative if the outbreak spreads and suspension of business activity is prolonged,\" it said.",

Commenting specially on the announcement of joint auction of bauxite and coal blocks, he said power is the most important requirement for producing aluminium and constitutes 30-40% of all the components. Hence joint auction of bauxite and coal is a significant step.He said the move to incentivise production is also a significant step taken by the government.This commercialization process would increase competition and addition and adoption of state-of-art technologies would become the order of the day in the mining sector. \"This will create an ecosystem for optimum utilization of natural resources,\" Rath added. \"It would be interesting to see the kind of incentives or opportunities that are going to be created for newer territories like Coal Gasification, Coal Liquification which will cater to our gas economy,\" he said adding, it will supplement and reduce the industry&rsquo;s dependency on crude oil imports and boost \"Make In India\" in terms of mechanization of mines. \"This is going to revolutionize the entire mining sector,\" he felt.",

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: Crude oil crash is creating several headwinds for both upstream and downstream companies, a report said expecting prices to to stabilise over the next four-six quarters given the shape of the global economy. While the global economy is projected to contract 3 per cent this year, the domestic economy is forecast to stall completely, though may stave off contraction, according to many analysts. India, the third largest fuel consumer and importer, is under a seven-week COVID-19 lockdown ending on May 17, has seen demand almost halving during the national shuttering, while the global demand crimped by 30 per cent in April, when almost the whole world was under lockdowns.  The prices fell also because crude has been in substantial oversupply since February. According to an analysis by domestic rating agency Icra, Brent crude is likely to trade in the range of USD 20 to USD 40 a barrel in the medium term or till the COVID-19 infections abate, as the world is fearing a second wave of the pandemic from next winter. \"Brent may trade in a band of USD 20 to USD 40 a barrel until the COVID-19 fears abate, with intermittent volatility depending on news flow,\" Icra told a webinar Tuesday. The plunge in global crude prices -- down from USD 77 a barrel early January to mid-USD 20s now -- is highly credit negative for domestic upstream players, while refining and marketing companies and gas utilities also face several headwinds. Profitability of the downstream sector will also be impacted by lower gross refining margins (GRMs) as the pandemic has eroded demand for refined fuel thereby weighing on crack spreads with gasoline and ATF spreads being the worst hit. While ATF demand fell 94 per cent in April, petrol intake plunged 64 per cent, forcing refineries to run at around 40 per cent of their capacity as the lockdown has stopped all traffic. According to K Ravichandran, a senior vice-president at Icra, the sharp drop in crude prices is credit negative for the upstream sector as their realisations and cash accruals will decline meaningfully. Additionally, gas prices at various international gas hubs have declined, which will lead to lower domestic gas prices in FY21. Accordingly, domestic gas production will remain a loss-making proposition for most fields for upstream producers, notwithstanding some decline in oilfield services/equipment cost, he warns. He further said unless the upstream industry gets some reliefs from government by way of reduction in fiscal levies (royalty, cess, profit petroleum) and changes in gas pricing formula to provide for certain level of floor price and/or removal of ceiling on prices for the deepwater/complex fields, their credit metrics will weaken materially in the near term. When asked about the likely inventory loss in Q1 for OMCs, having already suffered a Rs 33,000 crore hit in the March quarter, he said the ongoing quarter should not be bad for them in terms of inventories as they have been managing it well since March. Currently, domestic refineries are running under 50 per cent operating capacity owing to the decline in demand and the gap may improve as the lockdown is lifted.",

            "articleBody": "MOSCOW: The Russian rouble was steady in early trade on Tuesday, shrugging off a fresh slide in oil prices thanks to the central bank's selling of foreign currency reserves, while stock indexes inched higher. At 0810 GMT, the rouble was flat at 74.50 against the dollar and eased 0.2 per cent to 80.76 versus the euro . The coronavirus outbreak and its affects remain in focus. The number of new infections in Russia climbed on Tuesday by 6,411, a record daily rise bringing the nationwide tally to 93,558. The number of deaths reached 867. Hit by lockdowns, the Russian economy is on track to shrink by up to 6 per cent this year, the central bank said last week, while slashing interest rates to support the economy with cheaper lending. The rate cut and expectations that the key rate will be lowered further from the current level of 5.5 per cent supported prices of Russian OFZ treasury bonds, popular among foreign investors. The finance ministry will announce details of its weekly OFZ auctions later on Tuesday. The central bank is supporting the rouble with sales of FX from state reserves, the first interventions since early 2015. On Friday, the central bank sold 20.5 billion roubles ($275.69 million) worth of FX, its data showed on Tuesday. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.8 per cent at $19.21 a barrel amid concerns about dwindling capacity to store crude worldwide, boosted by fears that demand for fuel hit by the novel virus outbreak may be slow to pick up. Russian stock indexes were higher. The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 0.5 per cent to 1,088.8 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index climbed 0.2 per cent higher to 2,574.2 points.",

            "articleBody": "BERLIN: Germany and Britain said Monday that efforts to revive the global economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic must ensure a `green recovery' that helps the world tackle climate change.Speaking ahead of a virtual meeting of officials from some 30 countries, Germany's environment minister said it was important for economic recovery programs to invest in future-proof jobs that would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in coming years, rather than aim for a return to business as usual.``We mustn't invest in technologies of the past,'' Svenja Schulze told The Associated Press, noting that some countries are holding onto plans to build new coal-fired power plants.Some German politicians have called for stimulus money to be spent on subsidizing car purchases, to boost the country's auto industry.Schulze suggested that one way to do this would be to help care workers buy electric vehicles for house calls. ``These are many, many vehicles,'' she told The AP. ``It would help the economy and it would move us forward (in curbing emissions).''Scientists have warned that there's little time left if the world wants to achieve the headline goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord _ keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 C (2.7 F).Some have also likened the strategy adopted by countries in fighting the pandemic _ the idea of flattening the curve of infections so health systems don't collapse _ to the need to bring down the rate of greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming.Britain's Business Secretary Alok Sharma, who is co-hosting the two-day talks, said that ``the world must work together, as it has to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, to support a green and resilient recovery, which leaves no one behind.''Environmental campaigners have warned that heavily polluting industries are already seeking to tap into the vast sums being lined up by governments to stimulate the economy.``We are seeing the internal documents from industries indicating that they are trying to use this moment where public money is being put back into the economy to prop up their industries, whether it be the aviation industry... (or) the oil industry,'' said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International.``It's just really important, particularly with the oil industry, to note that this type of volatility that we're seeing right now, it's a rehearsal for what climate chaos will bring to the oil market in the future,`` she said. ``These are risky investments. They were risky investments before this crisis, and they are risky investments moving forward.''U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will participate in the virtual climate meeting Tuesday.",

Sheth, president, Arush Gas.&ldquo;We believe the experiences from the US technology and services, lessons learnt will greatly benefit India. The Government of India, through its various departments and statutory directives is supporting this energy transition very effectively, and Arush Gas is proud to be a partner in this significant transition,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Based on Galway Group's experience in the small-scale LNG and virtual pipelines segment, we are pleased to be given the opportunity to participate and contribute to India's clean energy strategy and virtual pipelines developmental framework, through this USTDA initiative,&rdquo; said Hal Miller, Chairman &amp; CEO of Galway Group LLC, USA.The study supports USTDA's US Gas Infrastructure Exports Initiative and the Administration's Asia Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy (Asia EDGE) initiative goals to strengthen energy security and expand energy access in partner countries, the media release said.

            "articleBody": "BAKU: Azerbaijan's economy will take a serious hit from decline in global oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, but economists and officials say reforms undertaken since a financial crisis in 2014 will help to mitigate the impact. Worldwide demand for fuel has dropped by 30 percent due to the coronavirus pandemic and last week President Ilham Aliyev said Azerbaijan, an OPEC member where oil and gas sector make up 45 per cent of the economy, should \"work and live as if we live in the post-oil era.\" As of Tuesday Azerbaijan had reported 641 cases of the coronavirus, and seven deaths. The authorities have imposed a nationwide lockdown and restricted domestic travel. Some state employees and those in oil industry enterprises are still going to work. Plummeting global oil prices six years ago sent the former Soviet energy producer's economy into decline, led to bankruptcies among its commercial banks and pushed the manat currency down by a third against the dollar. But changes undertaken since should help the country weather the current difficulties. \"After the crisis (in 2014), the economy was growing at a moderate pace, the exchange rate in real terms barely changed and authorities embarked on improving the business environment and diversifying to non-oil sectors,\" Ivana Duarte, the European Bank's for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) mission head in Azerbaijan, told Reuters. \"In addition, the combined foreign exchange reserves of the central bank and SOFAZ (state oil fund) are almost matching the size of GDP and can sustain the market pressure for some time,\" she said. SOFAZ, which manages the country's proceeds from oil contracts, oil and gas sales, transit fees and other revenue, has already sold around $2.5 billion on the market in the first quarter this year, up from $1.55 billion in January-March 2019, to support the manat currency and has the right to sell another $4 billion till the end of the year. The US dollar/manat exchange rate has been stable at 1.7 in recent weeks, supported by government FX interventions. The Fund said in an e-mailed answers to Reuters questions that it had been selling oil at an average price of $59 per barrel in the first quarter and added there was no need \"for any untimely and forced sale of assets included in the investment portfolio.\" Azerbaijan based its current state budget on an average oil price of $55 per barrel. Brent was trading at around $33 a barrel on Tuesday. Last week Aliyev ordered the provision of around 2.5 billion manats ($1.2 billion) or 3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) to support the economy as the pandemic spreads. The government and central bank officials have said it is too early to make predictions about the impact. The government had projected 3 per cent growth this year. Last week the Asian Development Bank cut its growth forecast for Azerbaijan to 0.5 per cent in 2020 from its previous projection of 2.4 per cent, but said the growth would rebound to 1.5 per cent next year. Bankers say that new regulations for commercial banks, including underwriting and forex lending standards, has reduced the risk of a new devaluation or bankruptcies among commercial banks. \"Banking sector is currently less sensitive to FX volatilities compare to 2015 and ... economy is more stable to short-medium term oil price shocks,\" Anar Hasanov, the head of Access Bank, told Reuters. \"Non-oil economy has increased significantly and domestic production covers big portion of internal demand for strategic products.\" ",

But he said the world economy, including India's, is looking at a very serious downturn. \"So, even if the prices are low it does not really mean much when the growth rate outlook is extremely feeble,\" Ahmad, the former Additional Secretary for International Cooperation in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, told ''. Noting that global rating agencies have slashed India's growth outlook for the current fiscal as well as the coming financial year, he said: \"That is of more serious concern, not the price of oil being low. Obviously that means we dont spend much (to buy oil).\" But the downturn at the global level and back home is going to be a serious problem for the country and it is that which needs priority attention, he felt. \"Low oil prices are a combination of high production but prices have also been hammered because global economy outlook is poor. So, it's a complex situation where the principal area of concern for India should be not the low oil prices but how to stimulate the economy, that's going to take some time because the impact of the coronavirus will be felt several months to come\", Ahmad said. According to him, it's not easy to revive the economy. \"We have a huge informal sector which is completely shattered by the damage caused by the lockdown and that is something we need to look at and the government will have to have massive cash hand-outs; plus, manufacturing is almost at a standstill and then IT sector has been damaged by the fact that the global economy is looking so poor,\" he said. \"All of these, they are all linked with each other, so we cannot just pull out oil prices from the rest of the performance of rest of the economy. Not only India, international community as a whole is looking at a bleak future which will not only slide through this year but also will consume a large part of the next year,\" Ahmad opined. International oil prices on Monday plunged to a 17- year low. Brent crude futures dropped to around USD 23 per barrel the lowest since November 2002, while US crude briefly dipped below USD 20 as coronavirus lockdowns dried up demand while the crude surplus ballooned.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Moody's Investors Service on Friday slashed its estimate of India's GDP growth during 2020 calendar year to 2.5 per cent, from an earlier estimate of 5.3 per cent and said the coronavirus pandemic will cause unprecedented shock to the global economy.  The estimate for 2020 compares to 5 per cent economic growth in 2019.  In its Global Macro Outlook 2020-21, Moody's said India is likely to see a sharp fall in incomes at the estimated 2.5 per cent growth rate, further weighing on domestic demand and the pace of recovery in 2021.  \"In India, credit flow to the economy already remains severely hampered because of severe liquidity constraints in the bank and non-bank financial sectors,\" it said.  Earlier this week, India imposed a three-week long nationwide lockdown, the most far-reaching measure undertaken by any government to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed at least 17 people in the country so far.  The lockdown has resulted in closure of businesses as well as factories and temporary unemployment for thousands of workers. The lockdown followed suspension of train, flight and long distance bus services last week.  The number of deaths around the world linked to the new coronavirus has crossed over 24,000. In India, over 700 coronavirus cases have been reported so far.  Moody's said the global economy will contract in 2020, followed by a pickup in 2021.  \"We have revised our global growth forecasts downward for 2020 as the rising economic costs of the coronavirus shock, particularly in advanced economies, and the policy responses to combat the downturn are becoming clearer,\" it said.  Moody's now expects real GDP in the global economy to contract by 0.5 per cent in 2020, followed by a pickup to 3.2 per cent in 2021.  In November last year, before the emergence of the coronavirus, the rating agency was expecting the global economy to grow by 2.6 per cent this year.  \"Our forecasts reflect the severe curtailment of economic activity in recent days as the coronavirus has spread throughout the world,\" it said. \"Lockdowns and other social distancing measures have expanded throughout advanced and emerging market countries.\"  \"Financial sector volatility has exploded to levels last seen during the 2008 global financial stress, despite the expectation of rapid policy response from major central banks and governments,\" it said.  The financial market stress is a reflection of deep anxiety and uncertainty around the real economic costs that households and businesses around the world will bear.  The severe compression in demand over the next two to four months will likely be unprecedented. Moreover, the widespread loss of income for businesses and individuals across countries will have a multiplier effect throughout the global economy.  \"Over the next few months, job losses will likely rise across countries,\" Moody's said adding \"the speed of the recovery will depend on to what extent job losses and loss of revenue to businesses is permanent or temporary.\"  Even in countries where governments are in a position to provide support through large and targeted measures, some small businesses and vulnerable individuals in less-stable jobs will likely experience severe financial distress, it said adding fiscal and monetary authorities are increasingly stepping up the level of support to their respective economies.  Fiscal measures include immediate support to households in the form of tax relief and transfers, credit lines and subsidies to businesses, and explicit government guarantees on bank loans.  Indian government too on Thursday announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package including free foodgrains and cash to poor, for the next three months.  Moody's said central banks are taking actions aimed at ensuring ample liquidity in the financial system, that credit conditions do not overly tighten, credit continues to flow smoothly to households and businesses, and the banking system remains robust.  \"For central banks, limiting the duration of the shock to one or two quarters is also imperative to prevent it from manifesting into a banking or broader financial sector crisis,\" it said.  Stating that it expects policy measures to continue to grow and deepen, as the consequences of the shock in terms of depth and duration become clearer, the rating agency said it is impossible to accurately estimate the economic toll of this crisis.  \"There are significant unknowns, such as how long the virus will take to be fully contained and, by extension, how long economic activity will remain disrupted,\" it said.",

            "articleBody": " Oil prices have crashed to 18-year low, plunging below $25 per barrel due to demand fears from Coronavirus pandemic and on expectations of record high supplies as key producers Saudi Arabia and Russia show no signs of reducing output. Falling oil prices is an indicator of a global slowdown. Global financial institutions and bodies have already sounded alarm bells on the economy from Covid-19 impact. &ldquo;Growth in this year will be below last year&rsquo;s levels. But how far it falls, and how long the impact will be, is difficult to predict,&rdquo; IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva recently said. The IMF had January forecasted 3.3 per cent growth in calendar year 2020, as against 2.9 per cent last year. Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development sees growth in year 2020 plunging to half to 1.5 per cent from its earlier prediction of 2.9 per cent. Global Recession? &ldquo;I would call it as global recession with some of the European countries showing negative growth, the US may be growing in the range of 1-2 per cent and overall global growth at about 2 per cent, China at 3 per cent, that&rsquo;s the kind of scenario we are in ...crash in oil is in anticipation of a huge global recession that is being priced in,&rdquo; said Abheek Barua, Chief Economist at HDFC Bank. Normally, oil prices tend to go down whenever there is a global slowdown, indicating sluggish demand. This happened in times of global financial crisis during 2007-08, and is now taking place too as the investors are fearing recession. &ldquo;Oil markets are certainly pricing in global recession. It is definitely a possibility,&rdquo; said Kunal Kumar Kundu, economist, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale. He expects a sharp drop in growth rate though not synchronized &ndash; some economies to see drop and even contraction during 1Q20 while others he said would experience the same during 2Q20, this would likely be followed by a reasonably faster recovery. Kundu, however, warned if the Coronavirus problem isn&rsquo;t contained quickly enough and continues to linger on, then the situation can certainly worsen.To Arun Singh, Chief Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet India, the oil plunge is a \"disaster in disguise\". The fall is a signal of how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the demand and global growth, he said.Implications for India?India imports 80 per cent of oil requirements, and the country therefore, stands to gain from any decline in its prices. Falling oil prices, economists say, is likely to help the country contain its fiscal deficit, and current account deficit. It is also expected to keep inflationary pressures at bay.&ldquo;Oil crash will act as one of the key support for India. It will bring some stability in the rupee, and also it helps the government manage its finances as it can impose excise duties and increase sales tax etc to shore up revenues,\" said HDFC Bank&rsquo;s Barua. He added it brings down inflation too, and it will offset any increase in food prices which may happen because of unseasonal rains. The gains from the low oil price to economy, however, will be offset by a fall in tax revenues, depreciation in the rupee, and through the indirect impact of slowdown in global and domestic growth, Arun Singh of Dun &amp; Bradstreet India said.OutlookHDFC Barua sees oil prices falling to at most $15 dollars per barrel, and then below that level. He felt oil, like any other asset class, is today seeing lot of panic selling, with fundamentals not being correctly reflected.Once the panic settles, he said sanity will return to the oil prices in couple of quarters. One good news of coronavirus infection peaking or being managed well can lead to a quick turn-around in oil, he concluded.",

            "articleBody": " TOKYO/HONG KONG: Domestic and international lenders are vying for a slice of Japan's nascent offshore wind power sector, which is expected to provide as much as &yen;3trn (US$29bn) in project financing opportunities, albeit at very low margins. Akita Offshore Wind completed the nation's first fundraising for a major offshore wind project last month, raising &yen;80bn to build wind turbines near two ports in western Japan. Auctions for sites off Japan's shores are due to kick off in April, and lenders are busy preparing for a rush of financings. A total of 12.6GW of offshore wind farm projects were environmentally assessed as of August 2019, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. This translates into construction costs of approximately &yen;7trn based on the estimated cost of &yen;565m/KW. Bankers are expecting debt financings to total at least &yen;1.5trn-&yen;3.0trn, although that figure could rise if all 12.6GW of projects make it to the construction phase. \"We have already been busy preparing for auctions of multiple deals where we are involved as financial advisors and we expect financial closing of these deals in the fiscal year of 2022,\" said Keiichi Takahashi, director of power and infrastructure project finance department at MUFG. The new law allowing the usage of general sea areas for the long-term development of offshore wind farms came into effect in April 2019. METI identified 11 potential sites for such projects, of which four are the most likely - two sites in Akita, one in Chiba and one in Nagasaki prefectures.  MODEST BEGINNINGS Windfarms near existing ports and harbours have already begun to attract interest from domestic and international lenders. In February, Akita Offshore Wind, a special purpose vehicle of a Marubeni-led, all-Japanese consortium, became the first borrower in the sector, agreeing a &yen;80bn 20-year financing. MUFG, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp led the transaction, which funded 140MW of generating capacity in the Akita and Noshiro ports in Akita prefecture at a cost of about &yen;100bn. A Green Power Investment Corp-led 104MW offshore wind farm in Ishikari Bay, Hokkaido, could be the next project to reach financial close as early as the next fiscal year, according to bankers. Although a dozen lenders - including one foreign bank, Societe Generale - piled into Akita Offshore Wind's deal in general syndication, only a limited number of banks in Japan would be able to drive and lead transactions in the wind farm sector. This is where international banks could fill the void, especially in auctions where multiple consortia require financial advisers, bankers said. \"Some international banks are definitely showing interest in these projects. European export credit agencies are, for example,\" said MUFG's Takahashi. \"A jumbo deal in general sea areas may not be able to secure enough funding from only Japanese investors.\"  TIGHT PRICING Offshore wind farm PF deals in Japan are likely to offer attractive pricing for domestic lenders with interest margins of around 100bp over Tibor, versus single-digit margins for plain-vanilla corporate loans or two-digit margins for solar power deals. That said, loan margins in Japan are significantly lower than in the rest of the world. The average interest margins for similar deals in Taiwan, Asia's leading offshore wind market, are more than double. The commercial tranche for Danish wind energy developer Orsted's NT$61.9bn (US$2bn) 20-year PF backing its offshore wind farms project off Taiwan's west coast pays an interest margin of 210bp over Taibor. The export credit agency-backed portion offers margins ranging from 75bp to 85bp. Similarly, the commercial tranche of Danish company Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners' NT$90bn PF, which is the largest deal in Taiwan's offshore wind market, pays a margin of 240bp during the construction period. The transaction subsequently steps down to 210bp during the first five years of operation. From the sixth year of operations until maturity, the margin will step up to 230bp. \"We can hardly lend to Japanese offshore wind projects as those PFs are too tightly priced,\" said a senior loan banker from a top-tier Taiwanese bank which participated in both deals. \"The pricing does not really reflect the high risks of those long-tenor and non-recourse PFs, let alone cover our funding costs.\" \"In addition, with the market growing so quickly, our liquidity is stretched and we can only lend to those wind-farm PFs with better returns,\" the banker said.",

            "articleBody": " JOHANNESBURG: South Africa's president said Thursday the coal-dependent country will turn to more renewable energy as one way to help ease power cuts that have \"severely set back\" efforts to rebuild the weak economy. But he warned of more blackouts in the immediate future. South Africans have been outraged by rolling power cuts in the current mid-summer that also have worried investors. The country relies on coal for some 77% of power needs, according to the department of energy, and some citizens were astounded when officials blamed \"wet coal\" in part for the blackouts. The outages are just the latest grievance in a country with 29% unemployment, widespread corruption and certain state-owned companies teetering on the edge of collapse. The economy is estimated to grow by less than 1% this year, and more than half of young people are without jobs. President Cyril Ramaphosa's speech was delayed by an hour and a half as lawmakers with the populist Economic Freedom Fighters party told him to sit down and argued that the public enterprises minister, Pravin Gordhan, should step down. \"We can't gather like normal here when things are abnormal,\" EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi called out. Party members later walked out of the chamber. Ramaphosa quickly acknowledged South Africa's problems. \"Our economy has not grown at any meaningful rate for over a decade,\" he said, and \"our public finances are under severe pressure.\" The president warned that the \"debilitating\" power blackouts will continue as the struggling power utility, Eskom, makes needed changes including long-delayed maintenance. \"Over the next few months as Eskom works to restore its operational capabilities, we will be implementing measures that will fundamentally change the trajectory of energy generation in our country,\" Ramaphosa said. Among the solutions the government is pursuing is allowing commercial and industrial users to generate their own electricity and allowing municipalities to purchase electricity from independent power producers. South Africa also will purchase more from existing wind and solar plants. \"We undertake this decisive shift in our energy trajectory at a time when humankind faces its greatest existential threat in the form of climate change,\" the president said, and he vowed to finalize the Climate Change Bill with its framework to reduce the country's vulnerability to global warming. Ramaphosa's term that began when the ruling African National Congress won last year's elections with its weakest victory ever has been challenging. He has promised to eradicate corruption after his predecessor resigned amid scandal and has vowed to turn around the economy and create jobs for millions of people. But Ramaphosa faces growing calls to provide clear solutions for the country's pressing issues. Many state-owned enterprises, including South African Airways, now rely on government bailouts for survival. \"After years of ... corruption and mismanagement, we are working to ensure that all SOEs are able to fulfil their developmental mandate and be financially sustainable,\" the president said. The economy remains grim. \"Low levels of growth mean that we are not generating enough revenue to meet our expenses, our debt is heading towards unsustainable levels and spending is misdirected towards consumption and debt-servicing rather than infrastructure and productive activity,\" Ramaphosa said. \"We cannot continue along this path.\" He promised not to let up in the fight against corruption but acknowledged that efforts so far have \"not been enough to free our economy from the grim inheritance of our past, nor from the mistakes that we ourselves have made.\"",

Rajeevan, Secretary of Ministry of Earth Sciences, speaking at a sustainability summit here.Blue economy in India is the sum total of economic activities sourced from marine resources. Fisheries, deep sea mining, and offshore oil and gas make up a large section of India&rsquo;s blue economy, said Rajeevan.Currently, there are a few projects underway as part of the blue economy. Out of 2.3 million square kilometres available to India, 1.5 million has been explored as part of an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) across both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. India has filed a claim since 2009 to nearly double its approved claim of 200 nautical miles to 250 nautical miles, the maximum permissible limit.Efforts are also ongoing for exploration of polymetallic nodules in central Indian Ocean across a 75,000 square kilometre area.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Crude oil prices are soaring and an expected trade deal between the US and China is the immediate trigger. Tensions between US and Iran is the other factor. The Brent variety has surged by around $6 or 10 per cent during December. The increase has been around 18 per cent for the October-December quarter.With crude oil getting costlier, there might be some short-term profit booking. However, experts say the global crude oil market will remain firm in the coming months as well. Opec&rsquo;s decision to keep oil production low till March 2020 is the main reason for it. &ldquo;The downside in oil market will be restricted due to supply cut by Opec and the US-China trade deal. So, Brent is expected to consolidate in the $63-68 range during the first half,&rdquo; says Manoj Kumar Jain, Director, IndiaNivesh Commodities.After remaining range-bound in the first half, crude oil is expected to firm up again in the second half of 2020, mostly because of the expected global economic recovery. &ldquo;After months of slowdown in 2019, global economic activity is expected to pick up in second half of 2020 and this will increase the crude oil demand by another 1 million bpd. So, Brent is expected to top the $70-72 range by end-2020,&rdquo; says Kishore Narne, Associate Director, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Mbpd stands for million barrels per day. Jain is more bullish. &ldquo;Brent could go to $75 dollar in 2020,&rdquo; he says.Brent prices likely to remain highAs India is an oil dependent country, a price hike will impact the economy negatively.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: BloombergImpact on the economySince India is dependent on imported oil, any flare up in prices can have serious repercussions for our economy. Increasing domestic inflation is the main worry and this may stop RBI from cutting rates further. While oil exploration companies will benefit, all other sectors that use crude derivatives as inputs will suffer. Since oil price increase will impact energy products like coal, natural gas, etc, this will negatively impact almost all manufacturing companies. &ldquo;Crude going up will be a headwind for the economy. It is going to be negative at the aggregate level,&rdquo; says Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO-Equity, Kotak Mutual Fund. Since domestic uncertainties about growth already exists and tax collection is already low, increasing crude prices may create problems for the country&rsquo;s fiscal situation too.Impact on broader marketHowever, the news may not be all that bad for the markets. &ldquo;Since crude oil prices have not yet reached the point of concern, we can treat it as a positive. It is also a sign of confidence about global macroeconomic growth,&rdquo; says Sandeep Nanda, CIO, Bharti Axa Life Insurance. For example, the immediate trigger&mdash;the US-China trade deal that could signal an end to the trade war&mdash; is good news for everyone.Oil and gas sectorThough the broader market will be agnostic to the flare up, it won&rsquo;t be same at the sectoral level and the main impact will be on stocks from the oil and gas sector. Since this sector has several sub-sections, let us deal with one at a time.There will be no impact on independent oil refineries like Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, because they take crude, refine and then sell the finished products to oil marketing companies. What concerns them is just their &lsquo;refining margin&rsquo;. The situation is similar for Reliance Industries, which operates the biggest oil refinery in India.Though Reliance and Essar are also into oil marketing, public sector oil marketing companies like IOC, BPCL, HPCL, etc still control the market. These PSU oil marketing companies may get into trouble if the government does not allow them to increase rates as per market rates. They may also be asked to bear the subsidy burden. For instance, the government had asked the oil marketing PSUs to take a hit on their marketing margins a few years back. Experts, however, say this is not an immediate worry. &ldquo;Right now, the government is allowing oil marketing companies to pass on crude oil price increases. This is a positive signal, and this may continue because the government is planning to divest some of them,&rdquo; says Nanda.BPCL is the first big company on the divestment list now. Since most other PSU oil marketing companies also rallied in sympathy, (BPCL rallied based on divestment news and others also rallied because their relative valuation compared to BPCL became cheap), there is not much investment opportunity right now.The subsidy fear is on upstream oil companies as well, because the government may not allow them to hike prices based on international crude oil rates. Since Cairn is part of Vedanta and not a separate company, the upstream oil space is also occupied by PSU giants like ONGC, Oil India, etc. Here again, subsidy burden may not be imposed this time because that will reduce the attractiveness of the divestment process. More and more industries are shifting from dirty fuels (coal, pet coke and fuel oil) to natural gas due to environmental concerns and this should increase natural gas demand in India. To boost natural gas production in India, the government may also remove price restrictions on domestic natural gas. If this happens, it will be a boon for upstream oil companies.ONGC\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil India\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the weak second quarter numbers, analysts continue to be bullish on ONGC due to various reasons. First, its weak second quarter performance was mostly because of the fall in crude oil prices, which fell by 17 per cent y-o-y. In other words, ONGC will start reporting good numbers in the coming quarters due to the spurt in crude oil prices in the third quarter. Though domestic production continues to be weak, its overseas production is expected to increase in coming years. Subsidiary ONGC Videsh has joint ventures in several countries like Russia, Vietnam, Norway, Egypt, Tunisia, Iran and Australia and contributed 23 per cent of ONGC group production during 2018-19. In addition to giving fabulous dividends (dividend yield ratio is now placed at 5.47 per cent), ONGC is also reducing its debt obligations regularly. For instance, ONGC reduced its borrowing from Rs 21,600 crore in March 2019 to Rs 10,400 by September 2019.Realisations should increase for Oil India also in the coming quarters compared to the second quarter of 2019-20, when its net realisation was only $61.3 per barrel. With a dividend yield of 7.24 per cent at current prices, Oil India is also attractively priced now and its attractiveness is expected to increase in coming years. &ldquo;Oil India&rsquo;s dividend yield is attractive at 7.6 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively if one considers the dividend expected for 2019-20 and 2020-21,&rdquo; says a recent Motilal Oswal report.AviationSince aviation fuel is deregulated, aviation sector companies will be on the firing line. &ldquo;The biggest worry for the aviation sector now is the availability of planes to fly and how companies are managing them,&rdquo; says Nanda. Since several Indian companies have placed orders for 737 Max planes, their problem got aggravated when Boeing decided to suspend its production. Since multiple woes are hounding this sector now, investors should avoid it.FMCGA crude oil flare-up will also impact FMCG companies that use crude derivatives as their raw material. Though input costs of lubricants companies like Castrol will go up, this may not impact them much because of their pricing power&mdash;the ability to pass on additional costs to the consumers. Due to strong brand loyalty, the situation is similar for paint companies like Asian Paints. Consumption of crude derivative is low for other FMCG companies like HUL.CementManufacturing companies, which consume a large amount of energy, is another segment that will be impacted negatively. &ldquo;Prices of other energy products will also move up with crude oil and therefore, this will impact most manufacturing companies even if they use any other fuel,&rdquo; says Upadhyaya.For instance, fuel grade petcoke has very high heating value and produces virtually no ash when burned and therefore, is used as a substitute for furnace oil. This means the price of petcoke will also go up, impacting cement companies that use them in their kilns. Since construction activity is weak now, cement manufacturers may not be able to pass on the full cost increases to the consumers.Among the cement stocks, ACC is still favourably valued and is also doing well despite the ongoing weakness in the cement sector. For instance, ACC was able to report a 3 per cent y-o-y net sales growth despite a small fall in sales volume. A 3.5 per cent y-o-y increase in realisation, due to 9 per cent y-o-y growth in premium products volume and price hikes initiated in March, is the main reason for this. Despite the fuel cost increase, ACC should be able to maintain margin due to its cost saving measures and product mix optimising strategies. Since tax rate applicable for ACC is now at 32 per cent, the recent reduction in corporate tax should also benefit it in coming years.ACC\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyresThough direct consumption of crude oil derivatives is less, input cost of tyre companies will also go up because of its linkage with natural rubber prices. This is because synthetic rubber, a substitute for natural rubber, is manufactured by combining naphtha and natural gas. Since the auto sector is on a slowdown mode, tyre companies may not be able to pass on the full cost increases to the consumers, especially to automobile manufacturers who buy tyres as OEM.However, the replacement market is still robust and companies like Apollo Tyres that are active in the space should continue to do well. Due to the expected improvement in volume and product mix, Apollo&rsquo;s domestic performance should improve in coming years. Apollo Tyres\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo&rsquo;s overseas production, especially its hub Europe, should also improve due to the anti-dumping duty imposed by EU. After the recent price correction, its valuation has also become reasonable. &ldquo;We expect Apollo&rsquo;s earnings to grow at a CAGR of 24 per cent between 2018-19 and 2021-22. Its current valuation of around 8.3 times its expected earnings in 2021-22 appears attractive,&rdquo; says a recent Reliance Securities report.",

            "articleBody": "] New Delhi: The day on which the hike in train fares came into effect, state-owned fuel retailers announced a 2.6% increase in the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) used to power planes. Two back-to-back monthly increases have pushed prices to their highest since June 2019 and may force already cash strapped airlines to hike fares. ATF, though, at Rs 64.32 per litre costs less than a litre of petrol or diesel in Delhi (priced at Rs 75.14 and Rs 67.96 a litre respectively).And up: The price of non-subsidised cooking gas LPG has also gone up by Rs 19 per cylinder, the fifth straight monthly increase since September.That&rsquo;s because: The price at which the Indian refiners buy their crude oil has risen in the last couple of months &mdash; from $59.70 a barrel in October, to $62.54 in November and breaching the $65 mark in December. So what? India imports nearly 84% of its oil needs. Low oil prices bring down our import bill which is good news for current account deficit (the difference between the value of our imports and exports). Low oil price also means lower pressure on the rupee as we need fewer dollars to buy oil. Centre spends less on subsidising fuel and LPG prices and oil companies can cut petrol and diesel prices and help bring down inflation (every 10% increase in crude prices can push up inflation by 0.2%). The lower risk of inflation means increased room for RBI to cut interest rates. Having to allocate less money to oil means higher public resources for other welfare projects and schemes. A sharp decline in oil prices within months of Narendra Modi taking over as prime minister in 2014 had helped the government rein in inflation, mop up resources by raising fuel tax and splurge money on big-ticket social sector schemes. Oil prices fell from $114.81 on June 20, 2014 to $48.79 per barrel on January 23, 2015.",

According to the study conducted by industry body CII, the mining industry's share in India's GDP (in real terms) in 2018-19 was a low of 2.6 per cent, down from 3 per cent in 2011-12. The study 'Towards a Globally Competitive Minerals and Mining Industry' was released at the Mining Summit 2019 here.  \"The minerals and mining industry is core to India's growth ambition of a USD 5 trillion economy. Exploration, extraction and management of minerals have to be guided by national goals and perspectives, to be integrated into the overall strategy of India's economic development.\n \"And at the same time, there should be efforts to promote domestic industry and reduce import dependency,\" Mines Joint Secretary Upendra Joshi said while releasing the report.\n The sector has a pivotal role to play in the 'Make in India' vision of the prime minister and exploration can improve India's mineral security and competitive edge.\n \"There is a significant scope for new mining capacities in iron ore, bauxite and coal and considerable opportunities for future discoveries of sub-surface deposits. The Geological Survey of India has almost doubled its exploration activity by implementing about 400 mineral exploration projects on various mineral commodities,\" he said.\nAttractive provisions have been made for inviting private investment in mineral exploration through revenue sharing model. It shall also be ensured that the regulatory environment is conducive to ease of doing business with simpler, transparent and time-bound procedures for doing business, Joshi added.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India's exports contracted for the fourth month in a row in November, dipping 0.34 per cent to USD 25.98 billion, mainly on account of poor shipments of petroleum, gems &amp; jewellery and leather products.  Imports too declined by 12.71 per cent to USD 38.11 billion in November, narrowing the trade deficit to USD 12.12 billion, according to government data released on Friday.  Gold imports increased by 6.59 per cent to USD 2.94 billion in the month.  The trade deficit stood at USD 17.58 billion in November 2018.  Out of the 30 key sectors, as many as 17 segments showed contraction in exports during the month under review.  Shipments of petroleum products, gems and jewellery, fruits and vegetables, leather and leather products and ready-made garments of all textiles contracted by 13.12 per cent, 8.14 per cent, 15.10 per cent, 5.29 per cent and 6.52 per cent respectively.  In November, oil imports declined by 18.17 per cent to USD 11.06 billion, while non-oil imports contracted 10.26 per cent to USD 27.04 billion.  Cumulatively, during April-November 2019, exports were down 1.99 per cent to USD 211.93 billion while imports contracted by 8.91 per cent to USD 318.78 billion.  Trade deficit during the period narrowed to USD 54.06 billion as against USD 82.47 billion in April-November 2018-19.  Commenting on the data, EEPC India Chairman Ravi Sehgal said though engineering exports have put up a reasonably good show with 6.32 per cent growth in November 2019, the overall external trade environment remains challenging and subdued.  \"We are working with the government to improve our competitiveness and hope that the issues raised by exporters, like the higher cost of basic raw material of steel, are addressed,'' Sehgal said.  ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said, \"The merchandise trade deficit in November 2019 trailed our expectations, with imports recording a substantial contraction on account of oil, transport equipment as well as a variety of other items, underscoring both subdued commodity prices as well as the weak demand conditions in the economy.\"",

PVC products are used in the housing and agriculture sectors, and demand for it, particularly in the Indian vinyls market, is expected to grow.&ldquo;This is a significant step towards Reliance&rsquo;s commitment to pursue backward integration and will pave the way for enhancing PVC capacity in India to cater to the fast growing domestic market. This cooperation ideally combines advantaged feedstock and energy from the UAE with Reliance&rsquo;s execution capabilities and the growing Indian market,\" RIL executive director Nikhil Meswani was quoted as saying in the statement.RIL will provide the planned joint venture operational expertise and entry to the large and growing Indian vinyl market, in which it is a key participant.ADNOC would supply ethylene to the potential JV and provide access to infrastructure at Ruwais in Abu Dhabi. The pact is part of ADNOC&rsquo;s strategy to expand downstream portfolio and international market access by 2030.As per the pact, ADNOC and RIL will evaluate the potential creation of a facility that manufactures EDC adjacent to ADNOC&rsquo;s integrated refining and petrochemical site in Ruwais, Abu Dhabi, and strengthen the companies&rsquo; existing relationship supporting future collaboration in petrochemicals.ADNOC said that the agreement underscores companies&rsquo; shared interest in leveraging the strength of the Ruwais ecosystem to unlock new value creation opportunities in India.",

The power ministry had responded in a statement saying the reports arrived at their conclusions based on a single month&rsquo;s data and it termed it &ldquo;nonsensical&rdquo;.November 2019 also witnessed a 20 per cent decline in average price of power traded through Day-Ahead contracts at the spot exchange at Rs 2.85 per unit as compared to Rs 3.58 per unit in the same month last year. Overall, the platform saw a 7 per cent rise in power trade volumes in November at 3,825 million units.Of this, the day-ahead market traded 3,389 million units with monthly sell bids of 8,579 MUs as against buy bids of 4,108 MUs in November. &ldquo;With sell bids at over two times of the buy bids, coupled with lower clearing prices, helped discoms as well as commercial and industrial consumers to save costs and optimize power procurement costs. Looking at the available historical trends and low demand scenario, this trend is likely to continue during the winter months,\" IEX said.According to the exchange, the overall 7 per cent increase in traded volumes during the month was attributed to higher procurement by Eastern and Southern states and demonstrates the consumers&rsquo; preference for the platform.",

The Survey recommends speeding up bankruptcy procedures and improving governance in the banking sector. ",

            "articleBody": "The country is in the midst of a deepening slowdown amid waning consumption -- the bedrock of the $2.7 trillion economy. New Delhi: India&rsquo;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is putting the flagging economy back on center stage after announcing the biggest privatization drive in more than a decade and making renewed attempts to ring fence the crisis-ridden shadow banking sector.The country is in the midst of a deepening slowdown amid waning consumption -- the bedrock of the $2.7 trillion economy. And while Modi has targeted transforming India into a $5 trillion economy by 2025.On Wednesday, Indian authorities went on an overdrive. The government decided to sell its entire stake in the country&rsquo;s second-largest state refiner, and its biggest shipping company. It also approved a proposal to pare stakes below 51% in some companies and pushed for an introduction of a new industrial code bill. Meanwhile India&rsquo;s central bank seized a troubled shadow lender to try and contain defaults from spreading in Asia&rsquo;s third-largest economy.&ldquo;This is Modi&rsquo;s renewed attempt to instill confidence in India&rsquo;s economic potential,&rdquo; said Priyanka Kishore, head of India and Southeast Asia Economics at Oxford Economics, Singapore.She added it was imperative for the Modi government to announce these measures as it attempts to bridge a widening fiscal deficit following the dismal tax collections and cuts to corporate tax rates worth $20 billion. Earlier this month Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service cut the country&rsquo;s sovereign debt outlook to negative amid concerns over slowing growth and revenues.After winning a second consecutive term earlier this year promising rapid economic development, Modi is realizing his popularity and support going forward hinges on passing tough reforms that unleash growth -- and create jobs -- in Asia&rsquo;s third-biggest economy. The economy expanded 5% in April to June, the slowest in six years and a far cry from 8% seen just a year ago. Expectations from data due next week isn&rsquo;t rosy either.Steep TargetModi is seeking to raise a record 1.05 trillion rupees from asset sales. He has so far has resisted big-ticket privatization and restricted sales of its holdings to other state companies, including the 369.2 billion-rupee ($5.14 billion) sale of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. to the biggest explorer Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp. last year. Now his administration is selling the government&rsquo;s entire stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Shipping Corp. of India Ltd.&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s steep $15 billion -- 5% of its total revenues -- disinvestment target in FY&rsquo; 20 may in our view need to be higher given the recent cut in the corporate tax rate and policymakers&rsquo; focus on macro stability,&rdquo; said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India research at UBS Securities India Pvt Ltd, Mumbai.The administration&rsquo;s focus on getting the economy back on track comes as it plans to offer 324 companies including Tesla Inc.and GlaxoSmithKline Plc incentives to set up factories in a bid to capitalize from the trade war between China and the U.S.India has jumped 14 places to 63rd in the World Bank&rsquo;s annual rankings for ease of doing business, rolled back a levy on foreign funds, injected $10 billion into sick banks and relaxed foreign direct investment rules in coal mining, contract manufacturing and single-brand retail trading.\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India is also poised to cut rates further after having delivered 135 basis points of rate reductions so far this year. On Wednesday, it moved to seize control of a second non-bank lender, Dewan Housing Finance Corp., stepping up efforts to contain the economic fallout from the nation&rsquo;s shadow banking crisis. The year-long crisis in the shadow banking sector has snowballed to become a drag on consumption and pulled down overall growth.&ldquo;While the markets will view this as positive, the move also goes to deflect the investor attention away from the government&rsquo;s non-economic agenda,&rdquo; said Prakash Sakpal, Economist with ING Bank NV in Singapore. &ldquo;Despite massive stimulus both the RBI and government has unleashed this year, the economy continues to be stifled as will be shown by the forthcoming GDP figures.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": " PANAJI: State finance department officials have informed GIDC that they are against a Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) proposal which seeks nearly Rs 200 crore from the government to pay the &ldquo;performance guarantee&rdquo; for a coal block that GIDC plans to operate.Sources also said that with the shrinking revenue situation, the government is not in a position to take on such liabilities and GIDC should explore other avenues for the funds needed for the performance guarantee, as required by norms set by the Centre.Aside from the lack of fiscal space, finance officials argued that GIDC is a corporation and it should try to raise capital from the open market to fund, what is in essence, a &ldquo;business proposal&rdquo;.&ldquo;The state doesn&rsquo;t have surplus money to give at the moment. The government cannot take such a liability on itself,&rdquo; said a source privy to GIDC&rsquo;s proposal. GIDC needs a financial approval from the state cabinet since the corporation has to pay a bank guarantee of around Rs 196 crore to begin mining operations.The Dongri Tal II coal block at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh has been allocated to Goa as part of the fifth tranche of allotment by the coal ministry. Industries minister, Vishwajit Rane, had earlier announced that the state would sign the agreement for this block by October 30. Coal mines have been allotted to state governments for sale of coal under the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015. The Centre said it will accept upfront payments in three instalments from successful bidders, along with the performance guarantee - equivalent to a year&rsquo;s royalty - prior to the formal signing of the coal mine development and production agreement (CMDPA).A GIDC source said that the government had yet to grant financial approval for accepting the coal block already allotted and that the CMDPA had not been signed. GIDC has also applied to Coal India for yet another coal block as part of the sixth tranche of coal mines allocatment. If the bid is successful, GIDC will mine the additional coal block, along with the Dongri Tal II coal block, a GIDC official said.Despite rejecting GIDC&rsquo;s application for funds, bureaucrats with the finance department feel that GIDC should go ahead and take up additional coal blocks. &ldquo;GIDC can earn a profit in the long term. They can raise funds from the capital market as it is a business proposal,&rdquo; said the state official.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The country's largest public sector bank, State Bank of India, has just released a report, that predicts only a 4.2 per cent GDP growth in the second quarter.The bank attributes it to low automobile sales, deceleration in air traffic movements, flattening of core sector growth and declining investment in construction and infrastructure.The growth forecast for FY20 has now come down to 5 per cent from 6.1 per cent earlier, the report also said.State Bank of India (SBI) joins other global agencies - the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation an Development (OCED), Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - in downgrading India's FY20 growth rates.India's GDP was already at a 6-year low of 5 per cent in Q1. \"Our 33 high frequency leading indicators reveal an acceleration rate which was 65 per cent in Q1 FY19, but declined sharply to 27 per cent in Q2 FY20. Besides, Skymet also reported that the country as a whole received 110 per cent of the long period average (LPA) of 89 cm of rainfall during the four-month-long southwest monsoon period, making it to the above normal category,\" SBI said.\"Among meteorological divisions, Central India and Southern Peninsula received the maximum rainfall of 129 per cent and 116 per cent of their LPA, respectively. Excess Monsoon rains and the floods caused by them had affected the Kharif crops in many states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Punjab.\"\"While 40 to 50 per cent soyabean crop has been hit in Madhya Pradesh, which is the biggest producer of the oilseed, 30 to 40 per cent of the groundnut and up to 30 per cent of cotton crops have been affected in Gujarat.\" \"As these states are major agrarian states, so this could have a negative impact on the agricultural growth. Considering all these domestic parameters along with the global downturn, we now foresee a GDP growth at 5 per cent in the current fiscal,\" the report said.\"We expect Q2 GDP growth at 4.2 per cent. Our acceleration rate for 33 leading indicators at 85 per cent in October 2018 is down to just 17 per cent in September 2019, with such decline gaining traction from March 2019.\"\"Even IIP growth number for September 2019 was 4.3 per cent, which is quite alarming. We are revising our GDP forecast for FY20 to 5 per cent from 6.1 per cent earlier,\" the SBI Ecowarp said. \"We expect growth rate to pick up pace in FY21 to 6.2 per cent. We also expect revisions to the GDP data as in the past, but that is likely in February 2020 as is the custom. In FY17, Q1 GDP figure was revised upwards from 7.1 per cent in every revision and finally settled at 9.2 per cent\", the bank said. \"We, however, believe this growth rate in FY20 should be looked through the prism of synchronised global slowdown (countries have witnessed 22-716 basis point decline between June 2018 and June 2019, and India cannot be isolated).\" \"India is also significantly lower in Economic Uncertainty Index when compared globally. We also believe that Moody's change in outlook from stable to negative will not have any significant impact as rating actions are always a laggard indicator and the markets this time have categorically given a thumbs down to such indicators,\" it said.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday unveiled a book on global finance, and said it suggests solutions for challenges that the world and Indian economy is currently facing. Launching the book titled 'The Rise of Finance: Causes, Consequences and Cure', she said it will help \"understand the current economic situation facing both the world and Indian economy\". The book is co-authored by V Anantha Nageswaran and Gulzar Natarajan. Nageswaran is dean of IFMR Graduate School of Business at Krea University. Natarajan is senior managing director at Global Innovation Fund. \"As a textbook, I am sure it will become very popular and more importantly, this will be a book that is very relevant to those of us, sitting on the policy making table. Secondly, its relevance and the timing of the launch of the book in India. We are currently facing a challenging time,\" the minister said. She said it has come at a time when questions are being asked about the nature of the slowdown, which is affecting the global economy and bogging it down and indeed questioning if India is actually in a slowdown. \"...the book examines the rise of financialisation globally. I really commend the prescriptive and descriptive narrative that supports the topic of financialisation and the solutions that have been prescribed for situations that the world and Indian economy is currently facing,\" Sitharaman said.  India's economic growth slumped to an over six-year low of 5 per cent in the first quarter ended June this fiscal due to slower consumer demand and private investment amid deteriorating global environment. This has prompted many global agencies to cut India's GDP growth by various degrees for 2019-20. The RBI, in October monetary policy review, had cut sharply its economic growth projection for the country for this fiscal to 6.1 per cent from 6.9 per cent earlier, expressing hope it will recover in the second half of 2019-20.  The government has recently announced a slew of measures, including cut in corporate tax rate, capital infusion into public sector banks, setting up a Rs 25,000 crore fund to boost realty sector, among others, to boost the economy.",

The project would be completed in two years ahead of schedule. And that is due to the political will of the government, he said.Appealing to the new graduands to develop entrepreneurship skills, the Minister said they should not thinking of taking up new jobs but create new opportunities.Dismissing reports of an economic slowdown in the country, Gadkari who also holds the micro, small and medium enterprises portfolio said he planned to create five crore more jobs from the present 11 crore in the sector.VIT chancellor G Viswanathan said, \"Though VIT had been recognised as one of the 10 institutes of eminence among private universities, his dream was to make the university on part with international institutions.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Wholesale price based inflation was unchanged at 1.08 per cent in August, reinforcing the expectation of a rate cut by the RBI in the October policy review. Although the RBI takes into account the consumer price index based inflation while deciding its monetary policy stance, the decline in core inflation has strengthened the case for a rate cut, said an expert.  According to the data released by the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry on Monday, the increase in prices of certain food items was partially neutralised by static prices of manufactured goods during August 2019. The WPI (wholesale price index) inflation was 1.08 per cent in July and 4.62 per cent in August 2018. Inflation in food articles rose to 7.67 per cent during the month as against 6.15 per cent in July mainly on account of rise in prices of vegetables and protein-rich items.  Vegetable inflation went up at 13.07 per cent from 10.67 per cent in the previous month. Inflation in protein-rich items like egg, meat and fish rose to 6.60 per cent last month from 3.16 per cent in July.  However, fuel and power basket continued to witness deflation at 4 per cent in August as against 3.64 per cent in July.  Inflation in manufactured products showed no inflation print at 0 per cent as against 0.34 per cent in July, showed the data released by the ministry.  \"The weakness in the core WPI inflation in August 2019 was broad-based, with 15 of the sub-sectors recording a sequential easing in inflation and as many as nine of the categories recording a year-on-year disinflation,\" said Aditi Nayar, Economist at ICRA.  With pricing power of producers unlikely to strengthen and commodities ex-crude oil likely to remain sluggish in the immediate term, the core-WPI inflation may remain sub-zero in the rest of this calendar year, she added.  \"The disinflation in core-WPI in August 2019 has further reinforced our expectation of a rate cut in the October 2019 policy review. In our view, the assessed space for further accommodation should be front loaded,\" Nayar said.  The retail (CPI) inflation in August rose marginally to 3.21 per cent as against 3.15 per cent in the previous month mainly due to costlier food items, government data showed last week.  The Reserve Bank has cut key repo rate by 110 basis points during this year by effecting a total of four cuts so far.  The economy which recorded a six-year low growth of 5 per cent in the first quarter of the current fiscal may require some action by the RBI to boost consumer demand in the upcoming festive season.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nBy TNN Vijayawada: The bureau of energy efficiency (BEE) has urged the state energy department to take part in capacity building in energy-efficient technologies. This will help AP, which is emerging as an industrial hub, to play a pivotal role in the industrial sector, especially in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, said BEE in a statement on Sunday.In a communication to state energy secretary Nagulapalli Srikant, through Andhra Pradesh state energy conservation mission (APSECM), the director general of BEE Abhay Bhakre said that 40% of the total energy produced in the country is utilised by the industrial sector. The energy consumption is expected to reach 443.4 Mtoe (million tonne of oil equivalent) by 2031 as against the present consumption of 347 Mtoe in industrial sector alone, he said.Bhakre observed that by implementing Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, 165 Mtoe energy can be saved by 2031 which is an equivalent of Rs 1.8 lakh crore. The cycle-I of PAT, implemented between 2012 and 2015, has been a success in saving 8.67 Mtoe energy, which is worth Rs 9,500 crore. PAT cycle -II is expected to save 17.5 Mtoe of energy with reduction of 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and Rs 19,100 crore worth in monetary savings.Replying to the BEE, Srikant in a press release stated that the state government has made supplying cost-effective energy a priority and it will help improve the potential of industrial development and overall economic development. The government also considers energy as one of the major components for industrial development with land and water. The state will only be able to compete with other states in attracting industries when it offers electricity at an affordable price and energy efficiency would help achieve the target, he said.Srikant further directed the joint managing directors of APTransco, CMDs of APEPDCL and APSPDCL to coordinate and implement energy-efficient activities in all areas.",

            "articleBody": "\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi says the private sector must continue to believe in the India story, assuring that he will do his best to make India a better place to do business. In his first interview after assuming office in the second term, the PM tells ET that he is working towards long-term growth, not the kind which happened between 2008 and 2014. What is your message to boost investor confidence?In today&rsquo;s world, any discussion or debate across various forums on development, economic growth or political stability, attention of the world is automatically attracted towards India. Expectations from India are not only from within the country, but even in the context of global growth and development a lot is expected from our country. At the same time, unprecedented mandate given to our government during the recently concluded election in the largest democracy has further raised the hopes and expectations.Performance of our government during the last five years has shown the scale, speed and direction in which we work. This has given a new benchmark for the country to judge the performance of the government. I consider it a very positive development that there are a lot of expectations from us even though we have not yet completed even first 100 days of the new government.Strong and sound economic fundamentals coupled with stable government with increased majority &mdash; I see these as the reasons for this kind of high expectations.I would request experts to see this government as a government in continuity from last five years, and not in isolation. Similarly, with respect to economic policy, I would request people to analyse the impact of two budgets together &mdash; one presented in February and another one in July 2019.It has been a common practice established over the years in our country to judge a budget based on what it has given or provided for specific sets of people and sector; based on what individual groups get, experts from those groups would analyse the budget. But now, time has come to look at the macro picture of how the budget will propel our country forward and what it will contribute towards world growth, rather than the micro picture of just &lsquo;who got what&rsquo;. I understand that this would mean a paradigm shift from the conventional thinking; but I am sure that in the coming months and years this aspect would find its place in intellectual debate.Economic pundits may analyse the performance of last five years which would give an indication of our commitment and delivery. Our government has proved that we are fiscally responsible, we have kept the inflation under tight control. It has good relations with all major economic powers. Interest rates have fallen. Reforms like Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) have been acknowledged to have benefited the economy. Logistics have become much more efficient. Stressed and stalled assets are getting resolved. Infrastructure is being built at an unprecedented pace.I consider entrepreneurs as India&rsquo;s &lsquo;Growth Ambassadors&rsquo;. I want to tell them that our government will leave no stone unturned to make India a better place to do business in all aspects. We want entrepreneurs to get better productivity and better profits, we want our industries to grow in speed and scale, we want our businesses to get access to bigger markets, both at home and abroad. We want our investors to earn more, invest more and create more jobs.Viewed in a global context, investors can be assured that India is the best destination in the world.In the last term you implemented broad structural reforms such as the GST and the bankruptcy code and ease of doing business. However, attaining the $5 trillion goal will require bolder steps. What are the other measures that the government has in mind?Let us, for a moment, step back and evaluate how big a reform GST was in a complex country, plagued by reform inertia for decades. It set in place a process of formalisation, which is irreversible and self-sustaining. Through IBC, we sent a message that entrepreneurial failure is neither fatal nor final. We put in motion an exit mechanism which is a win-win for the creditors, the workers and the market.Setting higher goals and objectives and achieving them had been the hallmark of our government during the last five years. Let me take you back to November 2018, when the then President of the World Bank, Mr Jim Yong Kim, commended India&rsquo;s &lsquo;historic rise&rsquo; in the &lsquo;ease of doing business&rsquo; rankings. He said that it was &ldquo;remarkable that a nation of over 1.25 billion people has achieved a rise of 65 ranks in a short period of 4 years.&rdquo; This kind of performance gives us further confidence in setting still higher goals. Five years ago, who would have thought that:India can implement GST;India can achieve status of an open defecation free nation;India can provide electricity connection to all households;India can provide access to clean cooking to more than 8 crore families;India can provide health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh to more than 10 crore needy families.We have laid a solid foundation for high, sustainable growth over the long run. India has broken the perception that developing countries cannot grow at a higher rate for a reasonable period without getting into the problem of overheating, that is, higher inflation. During the past 5 years, India witnessed the highest average growth rate with lowest average inflation. All the macro-economic parameters such as current account deficit, fiscal deficit, inflation, etc. were brought down to acceptable levels. This helped in restoring confidence in the economy and witnessed unprecedented FDI inflows.Indian economy was used to growing in a particular manner for almost 45 years after Independence. From 1991, the country tried to change gear and ventured into a different philosophy of growth and development. There was a beginning, but unfortunately due to political instability it never gathered pace which was required to uplift crores of poor people from their state of destitution and deprivation. Thanks to the highest rate of average growth during the last 5 years, we were able to bring crores of poor families out of this situation.When we talk about economic growth, it means wealth creation for the nation. It does not mean more money into state exchequer, it means more money in the pockets of people. It is wealth creation which will lead to prosperity for all.Experiences of last five years give me the confidence that this country and people of India have everything in them to achieve higher goals and higher objectives. I am confident that 1.3 billion people comprising millions of farmers, lakhs of industrialists, hundreds and thousands of young entrepreneurs and start-ups, women, through their collective endeavour, will take us there.Through you, I want to motivate our industrialists to believe in the India story and in the long-term potential of Indian market. They should carry on their business and complete their investment plan without any confusion. I reassure all honest and law-abiding businesses of all possible support from our end.The vision for the next five years is to have investment-led growth. We are targetingRs 100 lakh crore worth of investment in the coming five years. To achieve this vision, the government is working on policies to promote inflows from domestic as well as foreign sources. This would entail further liberalising our FDI policy, simplification of labour laws, further enhancing ease of doing business, power sector reforms, asset monetisation and asset recycling in public sector, and reforms in banking, insurance and pension sectors. While investment has to be driven by private sector, the government will do its bit to &lsquo;crowd-in&rsquo;. In undertaking all these reforms, the government will work with an open mind in consultation with all stakeholders.Most MNCs are tweaking supply chains in view of the trade conflict between the United States and China. Experts feel that this represents an opportunity for India to attract FDI. Does the government have a strategy in place to attract such investments?India today offers skilled human resources, rapidly improving infrastructure along with one of the world&rsquo;s biggest markets. For anyone looking to shift base, India is an ideal location. There is no doubt that the ongoing events are creating opportunities for some economies. But our policies are not designed to get some short-term benefit out of transient disruptions being seen around the world. We are focused on improving our competitiveness through long-term reform measures. It encompasses steps towards improving our ranking in ease of doing business, tax reforms with lowering of tax rates and simplifying procedures, labour sector reforms to encourage formalisation and FDI-related reforms to further liberalise the investment climate.The key story is about how the Fortune 500 companies see their production shifting. We would like them to diversify more, to do more production in India. We are constantly talking with these firms and understanding the difficulties that they face. We are very focused on creating the financial, regulatory, capital controls, taxation, labour and infrastructure environment to make it convenient for global firms to bring goods in a friction-less manner into India, run factories or service centres here, and re-export the resulting products. As an example, the GST will soon rise to the full &lsquo;model GST&rsquo; treatment of GST-on-imports coupled with zero-rating of exports, which is the most export-friendly indirect tax structure.The Indian private sector does not seem keen to invest right now. What what can be done to change this?I do not think this is a one-dimensional problem. Indiscriminate lending of the past created excess capacity as well as NPA problems. While we have brought the NPA issue under control, there is a requirement of optimum capacity utilisation for the private sector to make fresh investment. This depends on the domestic and international demand. We are facing some headwinds on this. One of the major reasons for domestic demand being curtailed is the credit constraints. So, it is a vicious cycle, which is at its last stage.In order to boost credit flow, the plan to recapitalise banks has been set in motion. Further, they are being encouraged to lend to Non-Banking Financial Companies. It is bound to improve availability of credit for the private sector and boost the economy while securing trust of the markets.Also, the government is fully behind the idea of &lsquo;minimum government, maximum governance&rsquo;. Strategic disinvestment of select Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) remains a priority area for the government. This would open up many new sectors for private investments to chip in.We have ensured clean lending and sustainable growth and I think that it is just a matter of a short time before we see the private sector booming again.With capacity utilisation crossing 75%, we would see growth in investment from private sector in the coming months. At the same time, the government will continue to aggressively push public sector investment and accelerate the execution for these projects to &lsquo;crowd-in&rsquo;.We have seen many domestic and international companies across sectors who are seeing growth in the coming quarters and are investing. Various ministries are in continuous dialogue with different industries to enable the private sector to grow at their full potential. We are willing to go as far as needed to ensure that &lsquo;animal spirits&rsquo; are revived and our entire private sector is bullish.The years between 2014 and 2019 saw a sustained upsurge in FDI. Is the government contemplating further measures to boost FDI?Even when global value of FDI inflow is declining, we have maintained steady level of about US $65 billion of FDI inflows. The years between 2014 and 2019 saw a sustained upsurge in FDI. India received US $286 billion worth FDI between 2014-15 and 2018-19, which is a 50% increase over the previous five years. The budget has envisaged a rise in FDI limits in certain sectors such as insurance. The bulk of FDI decision-making by global companies is no longer influenced by FDI capital controls that India has, as our capital controls against FDI are gone in most sectors. Now the questions are about India as an operating environment. This involves financial regulation, tax policy, tax administration, the behaviour of regulators, predictability of policy, quality of infrastructure. We are constantly talking to MNCs and understanding what difficulties they face while operating in India. We have addressed many of these issues in the ease of doing business effort and the balance of this agenda is the area that we will now focus on.We have also announced in the budget a scheme to invite global companies to set up mega-manufacturing plants in sunrise and advanced technology areas such as semi-conductor fabrication, solar photo voltaic cells, lithium storage batteries, solar/electric charging infrastructure, computer servers, laptops, etc. and provide them investment-linked income-tax exemptions and indirect tax benefits.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia and US appear to be talking past each other on trade issues. What do you think is the way forward?India and US are mature democracies with various forums of engagement on trade. Our countries are at different stages of development with different strengths and varied domestic market requirements. We have had pretty constructive dialogues in the last few months on various facets of trade and commerce and we are positive it will result in a win-win situation for both countries.What is the government doing to boost exports?Exports form an integral part of our growth model. This is where &lsquo;Make In India&rsquo; is making an impact. Today, for example, some of the coaches of metro trains running in Australia were made in India. It is earning a good name for our country there!Part of our vision to double farmer income by 2022 is driven by a focus on increasing exports. We are not looking at farmers as just producers but as potential exporters. In this, value addition by way of food processing will play a big role. To strengthen this, we have already set up many mega food parks, and many cold chain projects are being set up.We are not looking to boost exports by incentives only, we also want to improve the competitiveness of our exporters. Various measures taken to improve the ease of doing business have resulted in an easier regulatory environment, and we are striving every day to make it better. Lower interest rates, improvement in logistics sector and simplification of GST are some examples. The new automated refund system for GST will help exporters.The economy is experiencing a slowdown right now. The budget has taken some steps, can we expect more measures?The budget is neither the beginning nor the end of our work in economic policy. My team and I are thinking about these issues all the time and acting on them.The Budget announced Rs 70,000 crores capital in public sector banks to boost credit growth in the economy. Ideas such as asset monetisation, asset recycling and a continued focus on strategic disinvestment are aimed at raising funds for public capital expenditure. These measures will boost growth and crowd-in private investment soon.The issue is not merely about lowering of policy rates by the monetary policy committee, but also about the cost and availability of credit. The transmission of monetary policy is important. We are working closely with the Reserve Bank and the banking system to remove blockages in the flow of credit, especially to small and medium enterprises. We are also looking to remove all delays in government payments and tax refunds so that cash-flow in the economy revives.Surplus liquidity in the international financial market provides an opportunity to tap capital at lower rates. This makes lot of investment economically viable. All of us will agree that India needs investment in infrastructure.We remain committed to invest record amounts in urban as well as rural infrastructure, which shall lead to &lsquo;ease of living&rsquo; as well as create more opportunities for people.Amid a sustained crackdown on corruption, there is also concern about some actions by investigative agencies and tax authorities. What steps are being taken to allay such fears?For the vast majority of income-tax payers, considerable progress has been made&mdash;today refunds are credited to bank accounts automatically within weeks without any need for the taxpayer to go and pursue it with the officer. This has benefited literally crores of people and many have appreciated this. We are starting faceless assessment of income-tax return. This will eliminate human interface to a large extent.For tax evaders, we gave an amnesty scheme before demonetisation. Those who failed to use it may have suffered. If we look at the number of searches in one year, it is not even 1,000. During 2017-18, number of groups where search operation took place was 582, and in 2018-19 it was 980. When you see this number in the context of total number of tax payers, it will not be even 0.02%. So you can understand how scarce these actions are.However, it is a fact that some black sheep in the tax administration may have misused their powers and harassed taxpayers, either by targeting honest assesses or by taking excessive action for minor or procedural violations. We have recently taken the bold step of compulsorily retiring a significant number of tax officials, and we will not tolerate this type of behaviour.I have also instructed the revenue secretary to come up with measures to ensure that honest taxpayers are not harassed and those who commit minor or procedural violations are not subjected to disproportionate or excessive action. The post of member (taxpayer services) will be activated in both the CBIC and CBDT by posting a very senior officer for this charge. They will be responsible for improving taxpayer services and will keep a watch on grievance redressal.In order to reduce litigation and to effectively reduce taxpayer grievances and litigation, the monetary limits for filing of appeals by the tax authorities have been increased significantly. This limit used to be Rs 25 lakh for appeal in Supreme Court, Rs 20 lakh for High Courts andRs 10 lakh for income tax appellate tribunals. In the last one year, these limits with respect to income tax cases have been increased to Rs 2 crore for SC, Rs 1 crore for HCs and Rs 50 lakh for appellate tribunals. This will reduce pendency in higher courts and will allow departments to concentrate on litigation involving complex legal issues and high tax effect.GST was a big reform and we have seen constant tinkering and changes through the last 2 years. Are you satisfied with the evolution of the GST system?GST was a massive reform of a scope and size not seen anywhere in the world. When such huge reforms involving all states and Centre happen, transitional and teething troubles are inevitable. Compared to the experience of other countries with even smaller reforms, our record is outstanding. But my nature is that I am not easily satisfied. We must improve the system and reduce cost of compliance. Streamlined procedures for return filing and for refunds are being introduced this year. Once these are fully rolled out there will be a substantial easing of compliance. There were some transitional issues. Many have been sorted out. I know that some remain. I have asked officials to work through the GST Council to sort out the remaining pending transitional issues of genuine taxpayers and also remaining MSME issues on a priority basis, taking a sympathetic approach.One aspect of GST, that is consumers&rsquo; benefit, has always been ignored while analysing the performance of GST in the country. Thanks to the rate reductions, one study points out that average middle-class family saves aboutRs 1,500 per year in the form of lower tax on their household expenditure. We need to encourage digital transactions, which would bring further benefits to consumers and sellers. We need to inculcate habit of asking for bills while doing any purchase.Through your media house and other people from media, I would request to start a consumer awareness campaign which should also focus on digital payment and bill seeking behaviour.You may not be aware, if a business does his transactions through digital means, even with a turnover of aboutRs 1 crore, he will pay zero income tax. With availing some of the deductions in the form of savings and housing loan incentives, even one with a turnover of about Rs 1.5 crore would end up paying zero income tax.You have been vocal about the legacy issues of indiscriminate lending, this has also resulted in stress in other sectors. Do you see light at the end of the tunnel?Five years ago, we inherited a totally broken financial system. I had an option to let the country know the state of affairs in 2014 itself. However, I preferred to do the plumbing job silently as any such disclosure in 2014 would have shattered the confidence of investors who were looking at India with high hopes. I could have got some political mileage but it would have done severe damage to our future growth prospects.The economy between 2008 and 2014 was like a body bloated due to water retention. Do we want that kind of growth, where money just exchanged hands and no sector actually grew. We are taking concrete measures for the long term and I am sure the results will be positive.Today, we have not only pulled out our public sector banks from disarray, we have also made them stronger and functional. We have provided them the growth capital &ndash; almost to the tune ofRs 3 lakh crore, we have ensured functional autonomy, through Bank Board Bureau &ndash; the human resource management has witnessed a paradigm shift, we have brought in private sector talent. We have reduced the number of PSBs through well charted consolidation process.Due to all these measures, the credit growth has revived during the last one and a half years, but a lot more is still desired.I appeal to all the bankers to meaningfully pass on the benefits of low inflation to borrowers. They should also make use of significant surplus liquidity available in the system at the aggregate level.No growth is possible if bankers stop taking decisions on day-to-day basis. I reassure the banking fraternity that all their decisions taken in good faith with sound business rationale would not face any witch hunt.Sectors such as automobiles, real estate and mining are experiencing slowdown. Are specific measures in the works to turn around the situation?Demand in these sectors will revive with the acceleration of economic growth in the coming period. A continued focus on ease of doing business, availability of lower cost credit, stability in policy environment are key to sustaining long-term demand in these industries.Let me start with the mining sector. The whole world has acknowledged that after the scams of the previous regimes the natural resources allocation mechanism was in need of a massive clean-up. We have done that successfully and put in place transparent mechanisms for these allocations. This was a disruptive reform and naturally the system will take some time to stabilise. Notwithstanding that, in 2018-19, the mineral sectors apart from oil, gas and coal grew 9% in volume terms and double digits in value terms. Nevertheless, we are focused on the few problems identified in this sub-sector and are doing everything necessary.We are focused on reviving the housing sector, ensuring sustainable growth for developers while protecting the interest of the home-buyers. RERA was a massive step in this direction. As a result of this step, trust in the market, which was in short supply due to the actions of a few black sheep, is returning. Further, as you saw in the budget, we announced many measures to stimulate the housing sector. Interest paid on housing loans is allowed as a deduction to the extent of Rs 2 lakh for self-occupied property. We announced an additional deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for interest paid on loans for the purchase of an affordable house up to Rs 45 lakh. Last year, we had also seen how the GST council reduced rates for under-construction housing. These are all demand boosting measures. We have also come up with a model tenancy law, to further stimulate rental housing. The government is actively talking with the stakeholders of the housing sector to make the sector sustainable while making it profitable for developers and affordable for home-buyers.On automobiles, the finance ministry has had a constructive dialogue with the industry. The slowdown is transient, accentuated by credit constraints, some regulatory changes and passiveness in demand. I believe that both demand and the industry will bounce back strongly and soon. I would like to assure everyone that India has a large enough market and big enough policy space to ensure growth of internal combustion engine (ICE) based automobiles as well as electric vehicles (EVs). There is no need to speculate about the growth of either of the two. We are in a unique situation where both ICE and EV based automobiles can co-exist, co-create and learn from each other. We see a growing debate around data privacy, protection and its commercial exploitation. What are your thoughts on this issue and the economic opportunity it presents?The way I see it, the profound impact that the domain of software and information technology had on India&rsquo;s economy in the nineties, will be replicated by the domain of data and related ecosystems in India in the near future.We must look at data as an opportunity. The massive amount of data being generated, stored and understood is creating its own huge ecosystem of jobs, companies and businesses around it. With its talented youth, growing economy, conducive government and massive market, India can become the hub of data science, analytics and storage.Data privacy and protection is an evolving paradigm around the world. We believe that personal data protection for every single citizen is a must and we are in the process of evolving a framework for the same. We see Right to Personal Data in the Machine Intelligence Age in a manner akin to Right to Private Property at the dawn of Industrial era, as not merely a mechanism to protect but also as an enabler to spur commerce in ways we haven&rsquo;t fully foreseen.You have identified water conservation as big objective of your second term. Is your larger economic goal to reduce the dependence of the Indian economy on the monsoon. If so, how?Your paper is linked to the economy, so it is natural that you are looking for economic angles on this issue.We are currently celebrating Gandhi150 and especially at such a time we should not forget his trusteeship model. Our model should be based on &lsquo;Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay&rsquo;.In our last term, we ran a huge movement for Swachh Bharat and focused on eliminating open defecation. There was an economic angle to that as well, toilets constructed gave jobs, etc but more important was the goal of building a healthy society.We played a big role in the formation of the International Solar Alliance. We should not look at it from the limited prism of investment, this was a big shift to protect our natural resources. So, it would be a mistake to limit water to only the economic angle. Just like in increasing the forest cover we do not merely look at the economic angle, similarly in a large and populated country like ours, water conservation should be in the nature of the common man.To take India ahead, economic steps are as important as behavioural change. When a farmer chooses drip irrigation, there is an economic angle of sale of sprinklers, etc, but more importantly water is conserved. Economic benefit of water saved is a natural byproduct.Media publications like yours played a big role in making Swachh Bharat successful. I would urge you to similarly adopt the cause of water conservation and educate your readers about its benefits and importance, its impact on our GDP growth, decreasing malnutrition, decreasing diseases, etc.Jal Shakti Abhiyan is not intended as a mere government initiative. It is a mass-movement, driven by the partnership of the Centre, states and the 130 crore people of India.What was the government thinking behind the decision to withdraw Article 370?I want to be clear that our decision on Article 370 is purely a domestic one. Let me tell you I have taken this decision after great deal of thought and I am quite certain about it and will take it forward for the benefit of the people.You called for investments into Jammu &amp; Kashmir during your address to the nation on Thursday where you gave a call to build a &lsquo;Naya Kashmir&rsquo;. How optimistic are you about this happening?I am very confident of this happening. In fact, leading entrepreneurs have already expressed their interest in investing in Jammu &amp; Kashmir.In today&rsquo;s world, economic growth cannot happen in a closed environment. Open minds and open markets will ensure that the youth of the region will put it on the path of greater progress. Integration gives a boost to investment, innovation and incomes.Investment needs certain conditions: stability, market access, predictable laws being some of them. The recent decision on Article 370 has ensured all these are present and so investment will definitely flow, especially since the region offers investment opportunities in various domains like tourism, agriculture, IT, healthcare to name a few. This will help develop an ecosystem which will give better rewards to the skills, hard work and products of the people in the region.Better avenues of education like IIT, IIM, AIIMS will not only give more educational opportunities to the youth but also give the region a better workforce.Connectivity related projects like roads or new rail lines, modernisation of the airports, all of these are being accelerated. Better connectivity, better linkages and better investment will help products of the region reach across the country and the world, leading to a virtuous cycle of growth and prosperity to the common man.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: After being the best performer in the first quarter of this year, the rupee is turning volatile due to rising crude oil prices and concerns over fiscal deficit as the next government assumes office.The one-month Bloomberg Implied Volatility Index has surged more than 350 basis points in just the past five weeks after oil continued to edge higher.The gauge was at 9.45 per cent on Tuesday compared with 5.87 per cent on March 15. The gauge closed at 8.69 per cent versus 8.11 per cent on Monday.&ldquo;Volatility in the foreign exchange markets is a result of a combination of factors working in tandem,&rdquo; said Bhaskar Panda, Executive Vice President, Treasury, at HDFC Bank. &ldquo;Uncertainties are manifest as India awaits the election results. The sharp rally in global oil prices is adding to apprehensions, particularly for those countries running on twin deficits. The rupee may continue to extend losses until Mayend.&rdquo;\n  \n\n\n\nThe local unit is more likely to trade in a broad range between 69 and 71.50 until the end of May, dealers have said.The rupee was a tad up to close at 69.63 a dollar on Tuesday compared with 69.67 a day earlier.But it swung in the range of 69.84-69.53 during the day.&ldquo;Traditionally, volatility rises ahead of the general election results,&rdquo; said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities. &ldquo;This time, the surging global crude prices have added to the market&rsquo;s woes as investors and traders are turning wary of investing in India for now.&rdquo;Global crude oil prices have surged more than 10 per cent in the past one month amid reducing supplies. Wild swings have made importers wary of buying currency covers while exporters find it cheap to buy such hedges.&ldquo;Importers are now waiting on the sidelines as they expect the volatility to contract in the next few weeks,&rdquo; said Gaurang Somaiyaa, currency analyst at Motilal Oswal.&ldquo;Hedging too has become a bit expensive for them due to the rise in volatility.&rdquo;One-month futures contracts are now available at a 30 paise premium, compared with 22-24 paise a month earlier.",

            "articleBody": " Bengaluru: India plans to blacklist China Sunergy (CSUN), as the Chinese solar module supplier has failed to meet its contractual obligations with local project developers, new and renewable energy secretary Anand Kumar said.This is the first time that the ministry is considering such a step against a foreign solar equipment supplier. &ldquo;We will soon issue an advisory to people not to buy from them,&rdquo; Kumar told ET.The ministry is also planning to prepare a list of approved suppliers to shield Indian companies from the risk of dealing with unreliable suppliers, he said.Almost 90% of solar cells and modules used in Indian projects are imported, the bulk of them from China. The CSUN Group is one of the leading Chinese manufacturers with a production capacity of 1.2 gigawatts. The company didn&rsquo;t respond until press time Thursday to an email seeking comment.Solar project developers Acme Solar, RattanIndia and Refex Energy had complained to the ministry that CSUN had failed to honour contracts with them.According to a petition filed by Acme Solar at the International Arbitration Centre, Singapore, CSUN had agreed to supply it solar modules of an aggregate capacity of 30MW. Acme paid an advance of $2.95 million, which was about 30% of the purchase price or equal to the cost of 9MW of equipment. CSUN failed to dispatch 9W of modules by the agreed deadline, and did not return the advance either, it alleged. The Singapore arbitration court upheld Acme&rsquo;s appeal.&ldquo;The risk which Indian developers carry is over dependence on Chinese manufacturers,&rdquo; said a developer. &ldquo;If you quote low tariffs and work with not so reliable suppliers, cases such as this could be the downside.&rdquo;In an effort to reduce over dependence on Chinese equipment, India imposed a 25% safeguard duty on the import of solar panels and modules, mostly from China and Malaysia, from end-July 2018 for a year. It will be followed by a 20% duty for six months and 15% for another six. This has raised the cost of installing solar projects and consequently tariffs, but has not yet spurred any additional investment in local manufacturing.In a letter addressed to Kumar, dated March 13, Refex Energy also urged the ministry to deny the entry of CSUN&rsquo;s modules to India. &ldquo;We would request you to please take steps to blacklist the company in India, deny BIS certificate and not allow entry of their modules in India,&rdquo; said the letter. Refex claimed it placed an order with CSUN for procurement of 40MW of capacity which CSUN defaulted on. It also did not return the advance ($1.12 million) paid by Refex either, it claimed.Yarrow Infrastructure, part of the RattanIndia Group, sent a similar letter to Kumar in February. &ldquo;We request you to kindly direct the appropriate authority at Indian custom ports to hold back the custom clearance of the products being imported by CSUN into Indian territory so that no product of CSUN is allowed to enter Indian territory,&rdquo; it said. The company claimed that it entered into an agreement with CSUN for supply of 20MW of modules out of which only 2.77MW was delivered.ET has seen copies of the letters from Refex and RattanIndia.The ministry is in the process of preparing an approved list of solar equipment manufacturers globally which it hopes will help Indian developers choose prudently. &ldquo;The list will be operationalised by March next year,&rdquo; Kumar said.",

Fitch Ratings Friday cut India's economic growth forecast for the next financial year starting April 1, to 6.8 per cent from its previous estimate of 7 per cent, on weaker than expected momentum in the economy. \"While we have cut our growth forecasts for the next fiscal year (FY20, ending in March 2020) on weaker-than-expected momentum, we still see Indian GDP growth to hold up reasonably well, at 6.8 per cent, followed by 7.1 per cent in FY21,\" Fitch said in its Global Economic Outlook.  Fitch Ratings cut India's FY19 GDP growth forecast to 7.2 per cent from 7.8 per cent on December 6.  The rating agency has also cut growth forecasts for FY20 and FY21 to 7 per cent from 7.3 per cent and 7.1 per cent from 7.3 per cent, respectively.  According to Fitch, the RBI, has adopted a more dovish monetary policy stance and cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage at its February 2019 meeting, a move supported by steadily decelerating headline inflation.  \"We have changed our rate outlook and we now expect another 25 bp cut in 2019, amid protracted below target inflation and easier global monetary conditions than previously envisaged,\" it said.  \"On the fiscal side, the budget for FY20 plans to increase cash transfers for farmers,\" it added.  Fitch said, it's benign oil price outlook and expectations of accelerating food prices in the coming months should support rural households' income and consumption.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Subdued performance of manufacturing sector, especially capital and consumer goods, pulled down the growth in industrial production to 1.7 per cent in January from 7.5 per cent a year ago. The data of Index of Industrial Production (IIP), released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Tuesday comes ahead of the Reserve Bank's monetary policy statement on April 4 and may increase the clamour for cut in interest rates to boost economic activities. Meanwhile, the CSO has revised upwards the growth in IIP for December 2018 to 2.6 per cent from the earlier estimate of 2.4 per cent. As per the CSO data, the growth in manufacturing sector slowed to 1.3 per cent in January from 8.7 per cent in January 2018. There was also slump in the power generation segment as the expansion was almost flat at 0.8 per cent compared to 7.6 per cent in the year-ago month. However, the silver lining was the mining sector as it grew by 3.9 per cent in January this year compared to 0.3 per cent in the year-ago period. Giving more details about the factory output in the country, CSO said the capital goods segments, considered to be barometer of investment, witnessed a contraction and so was in case of intermediate goods segment. Data also revealed that both growth in production of consumer durable and non-durable goods too grew at slower rate in January compared to the year-ago period. The IIP growth during April-January period of the current fiscal stood at 4.4 per cent compared to 4.1 per cent in the same time frame a year ago.",

India, however, measures its economic growth on the basis of fiscal year (April-March).In 2018-19 fiscal, ending March 2019, Indian economy is estimated to have grown 7 per cent, lower than 7.2 per cent in 2017-18.Moody's said the announcement in Interim Budget 2019-20 on direct cash transfer programme for farmers and the middle-class tax relief measures will contribute a fiscal stimulus of about 0.45 per cent of GDP.\"These measures will support growth through consumption over the near term, albeit at a fiscal cost...\"In India, government spending announced ahead of elections this year will support near-term growth,\" Moody's said.It said RBI is likely to be able to maintain their current monetary policy stance after some tightening last year.The RBI cut its benchmark policy rate in February and changed the policy stance to \"neutral\" from \"calibrated tightening\". Inflation measures have steadily declined since the middle of 2018.On banking sector, Moody's said, although the overall strength of the system is improving, it remains a constraint on the economy.In February 2019, the government provided further capital infusions to public sector banks. These measures, combined with the application of the Prompt Corrective Action framework, which requires timely recognition of bad loans, and resolution of bad loans through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, are helping to address solvency and asset quality challenges.\"However, a complete turnaround of the banking system requires more time amid slower-than-expected resolution of legacy problem loans,\" it said.Non-performing assets declined to 10.8 per cent in September 2018 from a peak of 11.5 per cent in March 2018. The central bank expects this ratio to improve further to 10.3 per cent in March 2019.Moody's said, with range-bound oil prices, export growth has outpaced import growth for the last two years. Fiscal spending on infrastructure and the rural economy should continue to support domestic activity. ",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Inflation based on wholesale prices fell to a 10-month low of 2.76 per cent in January over the previous month on softening prices of fuel and some food items, according to government data released Thursday. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 3.8 per cent in December, 2018, and 3.02 per cent in January 2018.  WPI inflation stood at 2.74 per cent in March 2018.  Inflation in kitchen essentials like potato, onion, fruits, and milk softened in January over the previous month, the data revealed.  However, the rate of price rise in the food basket, as a whole, rose to 2.34 per cent in the month under review compared to a deflation (-0.07 per cent) in the previous month.  The retail inflation, released earlier this week, too declined marginally to 2.05 per cent in January over the previous month on continued decline in food prices, including vegetables and eggs.  The WPI data further revealed that wholesale based price inflation for 'fuel and power' segment fell sharply to 1.85 per cent as against 8.38 per cent in December 2018, due to easing in prices of motor fuel and LPG.  Also, there was decrease in inflation in manufactured products basket in spite of higher in some items like sugar and apparel.  The Reserve Bank, which mainly factors in retail inflation based Consumer Price Index (CPI), had cut the key lending rate by 0.25 per cent this month.  The decline in inflation may provide further head-room to the central bank to cut interest rate (repo) in coming months, experts said.",

The gross domestic product (GDP) growth is likely to be influenced by growth in bank credit and overall financial flows to the commercial sectors, though slowing global demand could play a dampener, said an RBI document released after the three-day meeting of the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).  The RBI had projected the GDP growth for 2018-19 in the December policy at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) and at 7.5 per cent for H1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the downside.  The CSO has estimated GDP growth at 7.2 per cent for 2018-19. ALSO READ: RBI cuts key rate by 25 bps, changes stance to neutral \"Looking beyond the current year, the growth outlook is likely to be influenced by... aggregate bank credit; and overall financial flows to the commercial sector continue to be strong, but are yet to be broad-based,\" the MPC said.  It further said that in spite of soft crude oil prices and the lagged impact of the recent depreciation of the Indian rupee on net exports, slowing global demand could pose headwinds.  \"In particular, trade tensions and associated uncertainties appear to be moderating global growth,\" it said.  RBI Governor and member of the MPC Shaktikanta Das said the risks are evenly balanced for growth.  The six-member MPC, headed by Das, also noted that the output gap has opened up modestly as actual output has inched lower than potential.  Investment activity is recovering, but supported mainly by public spending on infrastructure, it said.  The need is to strengthen private investment activity and buttress private consumption, said the MPC document, as the central bank reduced the key lending rate by 0.25 per cent, for the first time in the current fiscal.",

The deficit is budgeted at 3.3 per cent in the current fiscal.Crisil, however, cautioned that if the general elections this year yield a fractured mandate and derail/delay the process of reforms, \"the implications on sentiments, investments and growth could be adverse\".It said global crude oil prices are expected to soften to settle at around USD 60-65 average per barrel in fiscal 2020, compared with USD 68-72 average per barrel in fiscal 2019 as overall global demand slows.\"However, some price pressure could be felt in response to the recently announced supply cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),\" it said.It said fiscal 2019 would be the second consecutive year of sub-4 per cent Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation. From an average 4.5 per cent in fiscal 2017, CPI inflation fell to 3.6 per cent in fiscal 2018.\"We estimate it at 3.7 per cent for fiscal 2019, given the continuous and sharp decline in food prices and slowdown in global crude oil prices compared with a few months ago,\" Crisil said.It said the current account deficit (CAD) would reduce to 2.4 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2020 from 2.6 per cent in fiscal 2019.The rupee, Crisil expects, will remain volatile and settle at 72 to a dollar on an average by March 2020, compared with an estimate of 71 to a dollar by March 2019.\"Low crude oil prices and slowing pace of monetary policy normalisation in the US will support the rupee, so we see only a modest weakening. But given that India runs a CAD, the rupee remains exposed to volatility emanating from oil, tariff wars, and monetary policy surprises from the advanced countries,\" Crisil said.Crisil said domestic interest rates, which had risen last year, are expected to soften in fiscal 2020.\"With inflation under control, softer crude oil prices relative to last year, we believe the Monetary Policy Committee would change its stance to neutral from calibrated tightening and could cut the repo rate by at least 25 basis points (from 6.50 per cent currently),\" it added.",

OPEC issued a list of oil production cuts by its members and other major producers for six months starting on January 1 to boost confidence in its oil supply reduction pact. Last week, OPEC&rsquo;s monthly report showed it had made a strong start in December before the pact went into effect, implementing the biggest month-on-month production drop in almost two years. &ldquo;Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 70.70 and 71.50,&rdquo; said Motilal Oswal Financial Services. The dollar rebounded against its major crosses after industrial production number released from the US came in better-than-estimates. Industrial production rose 0.3 per cent in December compared to estimates of 0.2 per cent. ",

Forex traders said, the American currency lost some ground against major currencies overseas, while on the domestic front, the equity market staged a recovery and propped up the rupee.  At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (forex) market, the rupee opened higher at 69.95 and rose further to touch a high of 69.86 a dollar, showing a rise of 34 paise over it's previous close.  On Thursday, the rupee weakened for the second straight session and fell 2 paise to 70.20 against the dollar.  Traders however said that significant foreign fund outflows and rising crude oil prices weighed on the domestic currency and capped the upmove.  Foreign funds pulled out Rs 972.81 crore from the capital markets on a net basis, while domestic institutional investors purchased shares worth Rs 34.52 crore Thursday, provisional data showed.  The global benchmark Brent crude was trading higher by 0.13 per cent at 56.02 per barrel.  Meanwhile, the BSE benchmark Sensex Friday rebounded nearly 200 points and the NSE Nifty reclaimed the 10,700 mark, driven by recovery in auto, metal and banking stocks amid buying by domestic institutional investors.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The country's services sector activity slowed slightly in December, as new work orders and business activity moderated from November's recent high, while job creation saw a significant uptick, a monthly survey said on Friday. The Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index fell to 53.2 in December, from 53.7 in November, amid softer growth of activity and new business.\n Despite easing marginally, the services PMI was in the expansion territory for the seventh straight month. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.  \"India's service sector continued to enjoy positive levels of activity in December, with new business and employment remaining on an upward path. However, except for jobs, rates of expansion slowed slightly to form a somewhat disappointing end to 2018,\" said Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, and author of the report.  The survey further noted that business sentiment rose to a three-month high in December.\n Factors like advertising efforts, new service offerings and predictions of an improvement in market conditions after the elections, all boosted business sentiment regarding the 12-month outlook.\n \"With business sentiment improving for the second successive month, the service sector looks set to sustain growth in 2019 despite predictions of some sluggishness prior to the elections,\" Lima said.\n Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Composite PMI Output Index, that maps both the manufacturing as well as services sector activity, was down from a 25-month high of 54.5 in November to 53.6 at December.\n On the prices front, cost inflation at services firms softened for the third straight month to the weakest since May 2017.\n \"Subdued inflationary pressures and cooling economic growth add some support for a rate cut early next year,\" Lima said.\n The next meeting of RBI's Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled between 5th and 7th February.",

            "articleBody": "India will aim to receive USD 100 billion in foreign direct investments in the next two years and special industrial clusters are being created for countries like Japan, South Korea, China and Russia where their companies can invest and operate, Union Minister Suresh Prabhu said.The commerce and industry minister said his ministry has also identified sectors and countries which holds huge potential for investments in India.\"I have given a target. USD 100 billion of FDI should come from different sectors into India. It will not happen in one year. We have identified companies, sectors and countries and now we are going for road shows to attract investors,\" Prabhu told PTI in an interview.He said India would remain a top destination for foreign investors in 2019 and the ministry would look at all sectoral issues that may come come in the way to attracting overseas investments.\"For countries like Japan, South Korea, China and Russia, we are creating industrial clusters where they can invest and operate,\" Prabhu said.The minister said China has agreed to set up industrial parks in India and the Chinese authorities have been asked to give a list of companies that are willing to set up factories in India.Similarly, India would be happy to welcome firms from Europe and the US who want to move out of other countries and set up manufacturing bases in India, Prabhu said.\"We will be very happy to give them special status in India,\" he added.The comments follow several steps taken during 2018 to further liberalise norms and improve business climate in India to attract greater FDI.In the World bank's doing business report, India's rank has improved to 77th from 130th earlier.Earlier this year in January, the government permitted foreign airlines to invest up to 49 per cent in debt-ridden Air India, and eased norms for investment in single brand retail, construction and power exchanges.Norms were also relaxed for medical devices and audit firms associated with companies receiving overseas funds.The government permitted 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route for single brand retail trading and also in power exchanges that provide an online platform for trading in electricity.This was the second major liberalisation in FDI policy by the NDA government after major changes effected in June 2016.Total FDI in India, including re-invested earnings, rose to USD 61.96 billion in 2017-18, from USD 60.22 billion in 2016-17.In April-June period of the current fiscal 2018-19, the country has attracted USD 16.86 billion of foreign investments.Experts, however, said the government needs to focus on areas like infrastructure modernisation and easing of procedures to attract global investors.\"Globally also, FDI inflows have cooled down. India needs to take steps in areas like infrastructure and procedural easing to further attract investments,\" Professor Biswajit Dhar of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said.India mainly attracts investments from countries like Mauritius, Singapore, Japan, UK, the Netherlands, the US, Germany, Cyprus, France, and UAE.The sectors that received maximum FDI during 2018 include services, computer hardware and software, construction development, trading, automobile, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and power.To attract overseas companies, several states such as Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are also organising investors' meet for their respective states.The commerce and industry ministry has also started ranking of states on their ease of doing business. In the last report, Andhra Pradesh topped the chart among all the states and union territories.The ministry has now decided to help the states undertake a similar exercise for their respective districts.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: The rupee on Wednesday appreciated over 30 paise to 69.82 against the greenback in early trade following weak crude oil prices and losses in dollar on account of political uncertainty in the US. The local currency opened at 69.93 against its previous close of 70.14 against the greenback.&ldquo;Rupee in the last few sessions has been consolidating in a narrow range of 69.70 and 70.30 and with most global markets remaining shut we could continue to witness this low volatile session for the day. A plunge in global crude oil prices is benefitting rupee but at the same time uncertainty in global equities is keeping appreciation capped for the currency,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.Uncertainty in global markets was triggered after US government partially shut down on Saturday, and there is not yet any sign of tangible efforts to reopen agencies closed by a political impasse over Trump&rsquo;s demand for border wall funds. &ldquo;Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 69.70 and 70.30,&rdquo; brokerage Motilal Oswal said.Yesterday Japanese Yen gained against the US dollar as concerns about a partial government shutdown in the United States weighed on investor sentiment and the dollar. On the other hand, a less dovish than expected Federal Reserve meeting last week has heightened fears the US central bank will be raising interest rates into a weakening US economy. For the day, no major economic data is expected to be released and that could keep the volatility low for major crosses.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: India endeavours to take the Rs 11,000 crore methanol economy to about Rs 2 lakh crore in five years in a bid to promote cleaner fuel and cut down on the huge crude oil import bills, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said Friday.The transport minister, who inaugurated electric vehicle expo here, cautioned the manufacturers not to compromise on quality by importing substandard parts from China.\"India is now electricity surplus and there is also abundance of coal and solar power. Government's thrust is to promote import substitute, cost effective and pollution free transport that includes electric mobility.\"It is our endeavour to take Rs 11,000 crore methanol economy to Rs 1.5-2 lakh crore economy in five years,\" Gadkari said in his inaugural address.He said methanol was priced at Rs 12 a litre in Israel, Rs 16 a litre in China and Rs 22 a litre in India and was much cheaper than petrol and diesel.The minister said the electric mobility space has seen many changes in the last one year with e-rickshaws reaching every nook and corner of the country besides the advent of electric auto-rickshaws and bikes.\"A huge amount of foreign exchange goes out of the country due to crude oil imports. We need to check it...,\" the minister said adding that the government entity WAPCOS has inked a pact with Austria's Doppelmayr Group in the area of ropeways to provide mobility in hilly terrains besides tough areas.Cautioning against use of substandard parts in e-rickshaws and e-carts, Gadkari said the idea behind relaxation in norms was to benefit the poor and check the inhuman practice of hand-held rickshaws, and not profiteering.\"Pay attention to quality and standard. Do not compromise on quality with cheap imports of parts from China, else the government will take hard steps,\" he warned the industry.A joint venture was also announced between Keto Motors and Kyto Green Technologies with unveiling of electric auto 'KYTO'.Goenka Electric's CEO Zafar Iqbal said his company planned to spend USD 5 million in India in two years time and will manufacture 20,000 units of high-speed electric auto 'Super King'.MD of Saarthi brand of e-rickshaw Ashwani Sehgal said his company planned to manufacture 1,000 units of electric auto launched during the expo. The company launched electric auto 'Shavak'.Altius Technologies said it plans to expand its operations.The government is taking steps for implementing methanol economy in India and has constituted five task forces including one on its production from high ash coal.\"Niti Aayog has set up an apex committee and five task forces under it for carrying out R&amp;D activities and developing road map for implementing methanol economy in India,\" the government said Thursday.It said India imported 212.7 million tonne of crude oil in 2016-17 and estimated that a 15 per cent methanol blending can result in replacement of around 31.9 million tonne of crude oil.",

The local currency appreciated by 69 paise to close at 69.70 against the US dollar on Thursday after the US Fed hiked the interest rate but lowered its projection for future hikes.According to ICICIdirect, the rupee ended sharply on Thursday against the dollar on the back of a decline in crude oil prices as well as profit booking in dollar longs supported emerging market currencies including rupee. The dollar witnessed profit booking as major currencies staged a rebound supported by a relatively hawkish Fed policy meeting. A decline in US yields and lower oil prices could weigh on the dollar.Crude oil prices declined over 4 per cent on Thursday, hitting their lowest in more than a year on worries about oversupply and the outlook for energy demand as a US interest rate rise knocked stock markets.",

            "articleBody": " MUMBAI : The Indian rupee touched a near three-week high against the dollar on Tuesday on lower crude prices and expectations of fewer US rate hikes in 2019 as markets counted down to a crucial Federal Reserve meeting. The rupee was at 70.89 to the dollar, after touching 70.84, its highest since Dec. 7 and stronger than Monday's close of 71.55. \"There is no demand for dollars because of expectations of lesser number of Fed rate hikes,\" said a senior dealer at a state-run bank. Most of the dollar sales were from banks, though a few exporters were also selling, dealers said. The Fed will announce its rate decision after its two-day meeting ends on Wednesday. While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates this month, analysts are calling for two more hikes in 2019 compared with three in September on worries over a potential recession there, according to a Reuters poll.  Meanwhile, India's 10-year benchmark bond yield also fell tracking crude prices and rupee to 7.41 percent from 7.46 percent on Monday. ",

It closed 34 paise higher at 71.56 against the US dollar on Monday.Data showed trade deficit narrowed to $16.67 billion compared to $17.13 billion in the previous month following drop in gold imports. India&rsquo;s gold imports fell 15.59 per cent to $2.76 billion in November. &ldquo;Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 71.20 and 71.80,&rdquo; brokerage firm Motilal Oswal said in a report.Rupee in the last few sessions consolidated in a wide range of 71.20 and 72.30 ahead of the important FOMC policy statement that will be released tomorrow. Expectation is that the Fed could consider raising rates by 25bps and a hawkish stance could extend gains for the greenback. On the other hand, pound continued to trade with high volatility as Brexit related uncertainty weighed on the currency. From the UK, market participants will be keeping an eye on the inflation number; expectation is that price growth could slow in November compared to the previous month. ",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Taxmen may soon come knocking at the premises of companies that have registered for the goods and services tax and vanished, not having filed returns or paid their taxes.The authorities are considering putting in place an extensive plan to hunt for these missing GST taxpayers, which includes visiting their premises.There is a growing worry that many registered taxpayers have disappeared, a government official said. Besides, there are cases of fake invoices used to claim input tax credits.The tax authorities will initially verify the premises of GST-registered companies and could expand the effort to include scrutiny if they find tax hasn&rsquo;t been paid.Karnataka has implemented the plan and more states are expected to follow as GST collections remain below Rs 1-lakh crore a month. GST revenue stood at Rs 97,637 crore in November, falling back after crossing Rs 1lakh crore in October.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax administrators are also worried about a drop in filings of GSTR-3B, a tax return form to be submitted by all those registered for GST every month. The form was introduced to lower the compliance burden.According to the government, 6.96 million GSTR-3B forms were filed in November for the month of October. There are over 10 million businesses registered for GST.According to a Karnataka government circular, the inspection of business premises of registered entities by the enforcement wings revealed non-compliance on the part of taxable people by not paying taxes that are legally due to the government or not filing returns.&ldquo;For effective tackling of the situation with regard to persistent non-filers, more cases are required to be visited to ensure timely payment of tax and filing of returns,&rdquo; it said.Officials are empowered under the GST law to visit registered premises to carry out scrutiny, verification and checks required for safeguarding revenue interests.Tax experts said compliance under GST hasn&rsquo;t improved and the tax authorities are expected to resort to such measures.&ldquo;Percentage of compliance in terms of filing of returns has been a major concern for the government, particularly in light of recent cases of tax evasion and fake invoices that have surfaced. Over the last several months, compliance has not improved significantly,&rdquo; said Pratik Jain, national leader, indirect taxes, at PwC.From the industry standpoint, it only means that much greater rigour needs to be put in place to ensure that their vendors are GST-compliant, Jain said.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The upcoming interim budget &mdash; the last of the current government &mdash; that&rsquo;s set to be presented on February 1 is likely to focus heavily on rural and farm sector spending.The losses sustained by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in three crucial Hindi heartland states &mdash; Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh &mdash; are expected to cast a shadow on the budget-making process, which is already underway, said people with knowledge of the matter.Pre-election budgets are interim exercises in which new tax measures are usually not announced but spending is presented for the whole year, giving the outgoing government a chance to present its vision for the future.Higher social sector spending and a focus on lifting rural incomes are likely to dominate the February budget, said the people cited above.The government has already set in motion a plan to double farmers&rsquo; incomes by 2022. There could be more on that in the budget given that the electoral setback for BJP is being largely attributed to rural distress and farmer anger.The budget for FY18 had set aside Rs 2.36 lakh crore for the creation of livelihood and infrastructure in rural areas across a number of schemes run by different ministries and departments.BJP had in its manifesto for Rajasthan promised a universal basic income (UBI) and it is likely that this will find some reflection in the national budget.UBI had been floated in the Economic Survey presented by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian as an effective tool to lift people out of poverty. Any call on such a scheme, even in limited form, will only be taken in keeping with the resources available and delivery mechanisms.\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;There would be some impact of the (election) outcome,&rdquo; said a government official. Even before the state election results, finance minister Arun Jaitley had told ET in an interview on Monday that infrastructure and rural development will be focus areas going ahead.Spending on agriculture, particularly that set aside for procurement, is expected to go up to broadbase this in terms of crop coverage and geography.The new minimum support price framework that provides a cost-plus-50% price could see some tweaks amid ground reports from most states indicating that it has not been very effective.Average crop prices over the past few years show that market rates of major farm products have remained largely stagnant over the past five years, according to a Kotak report.&ldquo;MSPs have increased steadily at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 6% for rice, 6% for wheat and 5-9% for pulses but market prices have increased at a much lower CAGR of 2.5% for rice, 2.7% for wheat and (-)1.1-(-)1.8% for pulses, capped by higher supply,&rdquo; it said.Allocations are likely to go up for infrastructure creation, particularly in rural India, besides a special focus on medium and small enterprises that are said to have been hit by demonetisation and the goods and services tax (GST).Economists, however, do not see the government losing sight of fiscal consolidation despite the spending focus.&ldquo;The government is unlikely to the walk the path of fiscal profligacy. There has been considerable effort on the consolidation front and it is unlikely that they would give up on the commitment,&rdquo; said HDFC Bank chief economist Abheek Barua. &ldquo;There could be additional spending for the farm sector.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: India can achieve over 8 per cent growth rate in a sustained manner if it takes steps to revive investments and make exports competitive, said ADB Economist Abhijit Sen Gupta. Efforts will also have to be made to streamline agriculture marketing and improve supply chain, he said, adding that this is the area where there is scope for more reforms. \"Right now, the investment and exports drivers are really not firing... Once those two engines fire up India can sustainably grow at 8 per cent,\" Sen Gupta said. In its Asian Development Outlook, 2018, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) expects India's growth to pick up to 7.3 per cent in current fiscal and accelerate further to 7.6 per cent in the next financial year. Referring to exports, Sen Gupta said India is still a \"marginal player\" in global trade and there is a lot of potential to increase exports. As Chinese exports are becoming expensive because of rising wages, India can reap benefits by improving competitiveness. \"We need to improve our Ease of Doing Business and state of infra to benefit from trade and be better integrated into the value chain,\" Sen Gupta, Economist at the ADB India mission, said. On whether India can achieve double digit growth, he said: \"it is not totally unfeasible. But, I dont know if you can do that over a longer term period given the state of infrastructure and regulatory policies. Lot more reforms would probably be needed for that\". Referring to investments, he said credit to infrastructure and industry is picking up, which is a positive sign. \"But clearly a lot more needs to be done if the investment has to pick up,\" he added. Elaborating on the reform scope in farm sector, Sen Gupta said the government could revamp the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act and streamline the farm supply chain for free movement of goods. \"We have to see that the APMC act is more regulated and more state follow it,\" he said.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: In a surprising move, the Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel resigned on Monday evening.Commenting on the development, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan told ET NOW: &ldquo;Believe resignation of the RBI governor is a matter of grave concern.&rdquo;&ldquo;Government must take extreme care in its relation further with the RBI,&rdquo; he added.In recent times, the relationship between the central bank and the government has turned frosty over a host of issues, including the economic capital framework, PCA guidelines for banks and a special facility for NBFCs.The government has been pushing the RBI to ease lending rules, bring in more liquidity and allow easier capital norms for banks to boost economic growth ahead of general elections due by May.The RBI is increasingly under pressure to pay a higher dividend from its reserves to help bridge fiscal deficit. The government has argued that the central bank&rsquo;s surplus funds are higher than needed, but the RBI has countered such contention, saying it needs the funds for any financial emergency.The conflict dates back to late October when Deputy Governor Viral Acharya warned that undermining central bank independence could be &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;. In the latest policy review, Patel refused to comment the ongoing controversy, maintaining a tight upper lip.Here is the full statement:On account of personal reasons, I have decided to step down from my current position effective immediately. It has been my privilege and honour to serve in the Reserve Bank of India in various capacities over the years. The support and hard work of RBI staff, officers and management has been the proximate driver of the Bank&rsquo;s considerable accomplishments in recent years. I take this opportunity to express gratitude to my colleagues and Directors of the RBI Central Board, and wish them all the best for the future.",

India&rsquo;s current account deficit widened to $19.1 billion in July-September, a five-year high against $6.9 billion in the year-ago quarter and $15.9 billion in April-June. The CAD in second quarter of this fiscal year stood at 2.9 per cent of GDP, against 1.1 per cent in the year ago period and 2.4 per cent in the previous quarter. For Indian elections, exit polls of five states that went to polls recently showed mixed outcome for incumbent federal government. The final results are due starting tomorrow.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: It is important for the Indian government to heed the RBI's message on financial stability, IMF's Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld said Sunday, amidst reports of friction between the central bank and the Finance Ministry. Addressing a group of journalists here, he also said the International Monetary Fund does not want politicians \"manipulating\" central banks for political ends. \"There is debate over whether it's better for financial stability to be the remit of the central bank or an independent regulator...the UK in 1997, split them, then put them back together again. I'm not going to take a position on that...But I think...the central bank does have to be intimately concerned with financial stability to some degree and with the payment system,\" he said, responding to a specific question on the recent developments in India regarding the RBI and the government. \"We need to think about what is the best institutional framework in which financial policy can be set with regard to long term stability of the economy, not just to performance over political horizon,\" Obstfeld said. \"Well, I think they (the RBI and the Indian government) have reached an agreement on how to proceed. I think their (RBI) message that financial stability is important is correct. And it is important for the government to heed that,\" he added. Responding to a series of questions on the attempt in certain countries like the US, India, Argentina and Turkey to curb independence of central banks, Obstfeld said central banks' role as a financial regulator is critical. Central banks have \"much greater power than you thought\". They are fundamentally involved in financial stability policy, in fiscal policy, he said. Obstfeld said if one looks at the record, the decisions taken by central banks worldwide did stabilise the economy by avoiding much worse losses in output and employment. However, at the same time, he said, their moves also raised questions of transparency and accountability. \"So, it's not a shock that people raise these questions and it does create a challenge for central banks to be more transparent and to communicate more effectively with a broader public about what they are about and what they are doing,\" Obstfeld said. If the central bank cannot communicate more effectively about what it is doing, then there is a possibility of political manipulation where politicians attack the central bank and undermine it, he said. \"Clearly, we don't want politicians manipulating the central bank for political ends,\" Obstfeld added. After serving as IMF's Chief Economist for more than three years, 66-year-old Obstfeld is set to retire this month-end and will return to the University of California, Berkley. Gita Gopinath, Indian American economist from the Harvard University, would replace him from the first week of January.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Former Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian on Sunday warned the Indian economy was in for a slowdown for some time as agriculture and financial system were under stress.Speaking at the release of his book, Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy, he said both demonetisation and implementation of GST have resulted in moderation of the economy and the budget estimate of revenue collection from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) seems to be unreasonable.\"To judge the GST by what the budget demands of the GST, is unreasonable. I will say it frankly, the budget has made unreasonable demands on GST. It has asked for 16-17 per cent (increase),\" he said.He also said that GST design could have been much better and there should not be more than three rates going forward. The current rates are 28 per cent, 18 per cent, 12 per cent and 5 per cent.With regard to the economy, he said, \"we have to brace ourself for a slowdown for some time. I say that for a combination of reasons. First of all, the financial system is under stress, financial conditions are very tight. This is not conducive for rapid growth.\"The agriculture sector remains under stress, he said, adding international environment is getting much softer.\"Europe is slowing down, Japan is slowing down, there are political calenders. It is easier to do things at some moments than other moments. I think to expect huge reforms that will perk up the economy at this stage would be somewhat ambitious. For the combination of all these reasons I think we should brace ourselves for a period of slowdown. Then we have to see what policy actions are taken, how external environment changes, then we can think about real perk up in the economy,\" he said.He also predicted that Universal Basic Income (UBI) would find space in the election manifestos of various parties next year.\"Every major party manifesto will have some kind of universal basic income in it. I think it will happen,\" he remarked.Many Chief Ministers have liked this idea not for populist reasons but for good reasons, he said, adding the UBI will help plug leakages.He, however, said, \"If the Centre wants credit for this and it promises UBI on its own then fiscal space would be a serious issue.\"Subramanian said that the autonomy of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should not be undermined.However, he said there were excess reserves with the RBI which can be utilised for the recapitalisation of public sector banks and not for funding the fiscal deficit of the government.\"First, it can only be used for something say recapitalisation of banks and recapitalisation of banks only happen when there are reforms in the banking system in place, which the government should initiate. So it can be a nice cooperative bargain with the RBI.\"Second, it cannot be a unilateral process, the RBI has to be a part of this. The government cannot do it alone. Third, any idea that this could be used to finance regular deficits or other expenditures, I would be totally against it. Because that would amount to a kind of raiding the RBI,\" he said.Speaking about the revised GDP data released by NITI Aayog recently, he said the new series has created a lot of questions.\"If you look at the other indicators during that period, you see a big difference between those indicators and the recent back-series. It demands an explanation.\"",

            "articleBody": "\n\nBy Alasdair Pal NEW DELHI: India's government appointed a new chief economic adviser on Friday, naming a U.S.-trained professor who praised the country's shock decision to remove most of its banknotes from circulation. Krishnamurthy Subramanian, a professor from the Indian School of Business, will serve a three-year term in the country's finance ministry. His predecessor, Arvind Subramanian, abruptly left the post for personal reasons in June. While studying for his doctorate at the University of Chicago, Subramanian was supervised by Raghuram Rajan, a former International Monetary Fund chief economist who served as governor of the Reserve Bank of India for three years until late 2016. Shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's controversial decision in 2016 to withdraw most of the country's banknotes from circulation overnight, Subramanian defended the measure, which had been aimed at hitting money launderers and tax evaders. He co-authored an article in a business newspaper, the Mint, that described criticism as the result of \"exaggerated claims of disingenuous politicians who profess to be fighting for the poor\". There is an ongoing struggle for influence between economic liberals and more protectionist minded advisors, and both Arvind Subramanian and Rajan have criticised government policies after leaving their posts. During recent weeks a row erupted between central bankers, who fear the RBI is at risk of losing autonomy, and officials in Modi's Hindu nationalist government.",

This is an extension of its previous direction where the RBI sought to protect customers for frauds in online and credit-card transactions.The ambit of customer protection against frauds has now been extended, with the benefit of limiting customer liability now applying to unauthorised electronic transactions involving prepaid payment instruments. The central bank will issue the relevant guidelines by the end of December.Earlier, RBI said customers can&rsquo;t be made liable at all if they notify the bank within three working days of the fraud. RBI had capped the customer liability at Rs 25,000 if they reported unauthorised transactions within seven working days. The central bank has also unveiled an ombudsman scheme for digital transactions as a customer-protection initiative. &ldquo;An ombudsman scheme&hellip; is being formulated by RBI to provide a cost-free and expeditious avenue to tackle the rising number and complexity of complaints from this channel,&rdquo; Jain said.This September, 181 million NEFT transactions worth about Rs 18 lakh crore and 486.5 million mobile banking transactions worth about Rs 21.3 lakh crore took place in the banking system, according to the latest RBI data.",

International crude oil prices have declined sharply since the last policy and the price of Indian crude basket collapsed to below USD 60 a barrel by end-November after touching USD 85 a barrel in early October.\"Taking all these factors into consideration and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, inflation is projected at 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2 FY2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1 FY2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside,\" the RBI said.It said the projected inflation path remains unchanged after adjusting for the HRA impact of central government employees as this impact dissipates completely from December 2018 onwards.Although recent food inflation prints have surprised on the downside and prices of petroleum products have softened considerably, it is important to monitor their evolution closely and allow heightened short-term uncertainties to be resolved by incoming data, it added.\"\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

            "articleBody": " BENGALURU: The rupee will weaken over the six next months as uncertainty builds heading into national elections due in May, a Reuters poll showed. While a sharp drop in oil prices should help the slowing economy and the rupee, concerns will also persist over sluggish domestic demand which weighed more heavily on July-September growth than expected. Most major Asian currencies have had a bruising year amid a strong US dollar, though many have made some gains this week after the United States and China agreed at the weekend to a 90-day truce in their trade war. But the rupee - which is the worst performing major Asian currency this year with a fall of more than 10 per cent - was an exception, weakening more than 1 per cent on Monday. This week's surge in oil prices, alongside official figures on Friday showing weaker economic growth in India during the July-September quarter, is offsetting hopes for an easing in the trade war. Despite a few recent advances, the rupee is on track for its worst yearly performance in five years in 2018 and is forecast to weaken further. \"Politics is likely to decide the course for the Indian rupee in 2019. The political heat is already rising as the elections being held in five states currently will set the tone for the national elections in May 2019,\" noted Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING. Sakpal said it will be tough for Prime Minister Narendra Modi government to retain power for another term, noting lingering public anger followed a chaotic demonetisation in late 2016 and the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax in mid-2017. \"We expect it to be a too-close-to-call poll.\" The Nov. 28-Dec. 4 survey of around 40 strategists forecast the rupee would weaken over 2 per cent by the end of May 2019, just after the general election, to 72.00 against the dollar. It was trading around 70.49 on Tuesday.  But the currency is expected to have regained some of that lost ground a year from now, when it is seen at 71.62. Those results are in line with a separate poll of equity strategists who for the first time this year downgraded their outlook for Indian equities in 2019. Any gains were predicted to come only after next year's elections.  However, the outlook for the rupee was slightly better in the latest poll from previously.  Nearly half of 51 analysts predicted in the last poll the rupee would breach its all-time low of 74.48 at some point in the coming 12 months, compared with only 13 of 49 respondents in this survey. The Indian currency touched a record low on Oct. 11, hurt by the Reserve Bank of India's surprise decision to keep rates on hold.  But a recent cooling of tensions between the Indian government and central bank, accompanied by a sharp drop in oil prices since early October, gave a modest boost to the rupee in recent weeks. The central bank and government have been at loggerheads over the latter's demands, which included easing of lending and capital rules for some banks. \"The thawing of tensions between the RBI and the government is another positive for now, though recent tensions will continue to lurk in the background and are not positive for the currency,\" added Sakpal. Improved sentiment over the rupee was also reflected in a separate Reuters poll which showed bets against the currency declined in the past two weeks to their lowest since April.  With October inflation below the central bank's medium-term target of 4 per cent for a third month, the RBI is expected to keep the repo rate on hold at 6.5 per cent on Wednesday and until at least April, when it would hike again before pausing for at least another year.  But the rupee is likely to find it difficult to regain lost ground without the central bank's support. \"Despite the current relief for the INR, India remains vulnerable to domestic and external woes. Its weak external fundamentals leave it prone to another round of sell-offs,\" noted Amy Yuan Zhuang, chief Asia analyst at Nordea.  \"Moreover, a liquidity crunch in the financial system combined with excessive bad debts among banks diminishes confidence in Indian assets,\" she added.",

I think it will be around the same figure as projected by the Reserve Bank, which will be 7.4-7.5 per cent,\" Kumar told PTI.He was responding to a query on the overall GDP growth of India during the current financial year.When asked if the economy will bounce back in the third quarter, Kumar said: \"(It) may not recover. The recovery will be, I think, in second half. I don't know about quarter three. But I think we will remain in the same level and then become faster in quarter four.

            "articleBody": " MUMBAI: Analysts expect India's central bank to support an economy that is losing momentum by leaving interest rates unchanged at a policy meeting on Wednesday, when just over a month ago most of them had predicted a hike. Having resisted any temptation to jack up rates in October when the rupee was sliding to a record low against the dollar, the Reserve Bank of India has been vindicated by the currency's subsequent recovery, and by waning inflationary pressures thanks to falling food and oil prices. The rupee is now nearly 6 per cent off its low, and is expected to rally further as lower crude prices have also eased worries over India's current account deficit. \"We expect interest rates to be on hold until March,\" said A. Prasanna, head of research at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai. \"We also expect the tone of the statement to be dovish given inflation and growth momentum have softened, and the RBI will continue to keep infusing liquidity as bank lending growth needs to be supported to boost overall economic growth.\" Since embarking on a tightening cycle in June, the RBI has raised its policy repo rate by 50 basis points, with the last increase to 6.50 per cent made in August. There are now clearer economic reasons to avoid going higher, analysts say. A pause in rate hikes would also be welcomed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party as it prepares for an election that must be called by May. A Reuters poll of 70 economists predicted the RBI's monetary policy committee would hold its repo rate steady this week, and predicted only one more increase, most likely in March. More than 60 per cent of 51 common contributors from an October poll switched their forecasts to no change from a hike. Intense government pressure on the RBI to remove some major curbs on lending ahead of the election also means it is likely to take a more dovish stance. Policymakers have to nurse the shadow banking sector after a series of debt defaults by a major infrastructure lender. There had already been a sharp slowdown in lending by banks, laden with bad loans, and this had made them more risk averse. The difficult credit conditions have hampered Indian businesses still struggling to recover from a series of economic shocks including the sudden replacement of all large denomination bank notes in late 2016 and the introduction of a goods and services tax in 2017. Any dovishness from the RBI will be welcomed by bond traders who were until recently reeling under large losses after the 10-year benchmark government security yield rose to 8.23 per cent, before easing to 7.57 per cent as inflation concerns abated.  GOING DOWN Data released a few days ago showed the economy suffered an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in the July-September quarter, when annual growth slid to 7.1 per cent from the two- year high of 8.2 per cent posted in the previous quarter. Weaker global oil prices and domestic food prices are expected to drag the headline inflation rate below projections. In October, inflation eased to 3.31 per cent. The RBI has previously projected inflation at 3.9-4.5 per cent by the end of March and growth at 7.4 per cent for the current fiscal year to March 31. But both are likely to be revised downwards, analysts said. However, there are some who expect inflation to rise faster, still see more rate rises ahead. Among them is Goldman Sachs, which expects the RBI to raise rates by a total of 75 basis points between April and December of 2019. \"Inflation is likely to pick up later next year mostly driven by food balanced against some beneficial effect of lower commodity prices,\" said Prachi Mishra, India chief economist at Goldman Sachs, in Mumbai. She added that the investment house has cut their India growth forecast to 7.3 per cent for 2018/19 from 8 per cent predicted a year back.",

New Delhi: Buoyed by a rise in domestic and foreign demand, India&rsquo;s factory activity in November expanded at the fastest pace this year, a private survey showed on Monday.The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index, compiled by IHS Markit, rose to 54 in November from October&rsquo;s 53.1.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA reading of over 50 on this survey-based index indicates expansion, below that contraction.&ldquo;Indian manufacturing sector continued to recover from ground lost in August, with November seeing the headline PMI climb to an 11-month high,&rdquo; said Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.On the employment front, goods producers created jobs in November. Though the increase in employment softened slightly since October, but was among the fastest seen in six years, the survey noted.Going ahead, business sentiment improved from October's 20-month low, with Indian manufacturers forecasting better market conditions in the coming 12 months.Official data released last week showed India&rsquo;s manufacturing growing 7.4 per cent in the July-September quarter compared with 13.5 per cent in the preceding quarter and 7.1 per cent in the year earlier as a rise in input and energy costs along with rupee depreciation hit corporate margins. This made the gross domestic product expanded 7.1 per cent in the second quarter of FY19, down from 8.2 per cent in the April-June period.\"Manufacturers further drew down their finished goods stocks to meet demand. This, coupled with improved business sentiment, should ensure that production continues to rise at a robust clip as we head towards 2019,\" Lima added.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India&rsquo;s inflation data is once again under scrutiny after a member of the central bank&rsquo;s monetary policy panel raised questions about its efficacy.There was an urgent need to modernize the way changes to prices are being calculated by the government as well as the way inflation expectations are being surveyed by the Reserve Bank of India, Ravindra Dholakia, a dovish member of the panel, wrote recently in the Economic and Political Weekly.&ldquo;If a country accepts inflation-targeting framework, it has to be extremely serious and cautious about the correct and realistic measurement of its inflation rate,&rdquo; Dholakia said. &ldquo;Inflation-targeting framework without proper measurement of inflation rate can involve very high real costs and make the policy counterproductive.&rdquo;Dholakia said the current practice of measuring the inflation rate from a fixed base weight index is &ldquo;outdated&rdquo; and likely to overstate inflation substantially compared to the chain-weighted index used in developed countries. The latter refers to the method of continuously changing the weight of goods and services to match prevailing trends as opposed to keeping it fixed.The comments come at a time when inflation continues to undershoot the RBI&rsquo;s forecasts. Inflation averaged 4.3 percent in the six months of the fiscal year through September, below the RBI&rsquo;s range of 4.7 percent to 5.1 percent from its April monetary policy statement. At 3.31 percent in October, inflation is already underneath the 3.9 percent lower end of the range for the second half. The RBI&rsquo;s target is to keep inflation at 4 percent over the medium term.Part of the reason for the inflation miss this year is volatile oil and benign food prices. The RBI twice raised its inflation forecasts for the fiscal second-half: in June and August, when it raised interest rates amid elevated crude prices and a currency slump. It then lowered the projection in October as food prices unusually softened, which enabled policy makers to keep rates unchanged.Most economists in a Bloomberg survey predict the RBI will hold its benchmark rate at 6.5 percent again on Wednesday.Questions about the inflation methodology follow recent concerns about revisions to gross domestic product data. Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s administration triggered a political controversy last week, when it released figures showing the economy expanded at a much slower pace under the previous government than reported earlier.&lsquo;Elusive Results&rsquo;Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, said the central bank should stick to forecasts for three to six months as variables like oil prices are difficult to predict.&ldquo;Generating forecasts under and often unstated assumptions about exogenous variables such as oil prices, government spending, and global growth will throw up illusory or elusive results,&rdquo; he said.A spokesman for the central bank didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to an email seeking a comment. The RBI has in the past said its inflation model is able to ascertain how quickly prices and wages adjust.Abhishek Gupta, Bloomberg India economist, says the RBI should drop its household inflation survey too since it often paints a hawkish picture. The central bank cites this survey for gauging inflation expectations.&ldquo;We find that the household inflation surveys are backward looking, which means respondents rely on past experience of actual inflation when forming expectations about future inflation,&rdquo; Gupta said, a view mirrored by Dholakia in his paper.",

The local currency closed 87 paise, or 1.26 per cent, down at 70.46 against the US dollar.Oil prices jumped sharply after the US and China agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade dispute, and ahead of a meeting this week of the producer club Opec that is expected to agree to cut supply. Brent crude was hovering 3.85 per cent up at $61.75 around 4.50 (IST), while WTI crude was up 4.24 per cent at $53.09 per barrel.&ldquo;The rupee declined today on account of sharp rebound in the crude oil prices in the international market. Further India&rsquo;s GDP and fiscal deficit data disappointed the market. Hence the rupee is under pressure. Focus will now shift to the RBI and Opec meetings,&rdquo; said Rushabh Maru, Research Analyst, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, began its three-day policy review deliberations on Monday amid expectations of status quo on interest rate.Experts are of the view that the RBI may not change the benchmark lending rate (repo) despite moderation in economic growth and easing inflation. The MPC meet will continue till December 5. The decision of the MPC will be placed on the RBI's website in the afternoon of December 5.India's economic growth slowed to 7.1 per cent in the September quarter after peaking to an over two-year high in the first three months of this fiscal, as consumption demand moderated and farm sector displayed signs of weakness.",

Moreover, a seasonal uptrend in exports should help moderate the current account deficit in H2 FY2019 relative to H1 FY2019,\" Nayar added.Following the year-on-year surge in crude oil prices, India's net import bill related to petroleum, crude and crude related products increased by a sharp 60 per cent to $23 billion in September quarter this fiscal, from $14 billion in the same period last fiscal.Additionally, gold imports rose by 61 per cent to $9 billion in the September quarter, from $6 billion in the year-ago period.These two item groups account for around 80 per cent of the rise in India's merchandise trade deficit in the second quarter of the fiscal, relative to the year-ago quarter, ICRA said.",

            "articleBody": " India&rsquo;s economy grew at a much slower pace than economists expected last quarter, giving the central bank more reason to keep interest rates unchanged this week.After breaking through the 8 percent mark in the quarter through June, growth eased to 7.1 percent in the three months through September -- lower than almost all the estimates in a Bloomberg survey -- as back-to-back rate hikes in June and August, a funding squeeze and subdued growth in farming put a brake on the world&rsquo;s fastest-expanding economy.With inflation already at a 13-month low and oil prices sliding, calls for the Reserve Bank of India to stay on hold on Wednesday -- as most economists expect -- are getting stronger. The RBI kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in October, lowering its growth forecast for the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year to 7.4 percent.\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;We continue to forecast that India&rsquo;s growth will slow down in 2019,&rdquo; said Priyanka Kishore, an economist at Oxford Economics in Singapore. &ldquo;And with cost pressures easing, we now expect the RBI to pause policy for an extended period.&rdquo;Like elsewhere in Asia, growth in India is coming off the boil amid waning global demand wanes and trade tensions. While the 7 percent-plus expansion still makes India a growth star, the more subdued outlook brings uncertainty to fiscal and monetary policy.Budget goals may come under pressure if slower growth prompts Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s administration to boost spending before elections next year. It may also increase tension between the Reserve Bank of India and the government, which is trying to get Governor Urjit Patel and his team to do more to ease the credit crunch.\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;Based on the September quarter GDP growth and likelihood of lower growth in the second half of the year, chances of fiscal slippage are very high,&rdquo; said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist with India Ratings &amp; Research, the local unit of Fitch Ratings. &ldquo;The central bank is expected to stay on hold,&rdquo; he said.A slew of high-frequency data between July and September, as well as Bloomberg News&rsquo; indicator of animal spirits, already pointed to subdued demand in the quarter. Growth in industrial production eased in each of the three months amid a surge in fuel costs, while automobile sales moderated in the period.Sectors like retail and real estate have been hit after debt defaults by a troubled financier forced many shadow banks to curtail lending when their own borrowing costs surged.What Our Economists Say....Inflation has already slowed sharply and the recent tumble in oil prices points to a further downtrend. The added disinflationary force from a widening output gap is likely to act as the final straw for a change in RBI&rsquo;s policy stance. We expect the central bank to hold rates at its Dec. 5 review and revert back to neutral from its stance of calibrated tightening. -- Abhishek Gupta, Bloomberg EconomicsKey Details of GDP ReportGross domestic product gained 7.1 percent in the July-September quarter from a year ago, compared with a median estimate of 7.5 percent in a Bloomberg survey of economists Gross value added -- a key input of GDP that strips out taxes -- rose 6.9 percent in the July-September quarter from a year ago, compared with the median estimate of 7.3 percent Agriculture growth eased to 3.8 percent in the quarter; manufacturing slowed to 7.4 percent Private consumption growth weakened to 7 percent, while government spending gained 12.7 percent",

It was $51.11 billion in 2016-17.India had suggested China for renminbi-rupee trade to boost its exports and tackle the widening trade deficit concern.\"They have not accepted the proposal,\" the official said.The issue was discussed in an inter-ministerial meeting in October. In the meeting, it was suggested to the Reserve Bank of India and the Department of Economic Affairs would look at the possibility of exploring renminbi-rupee trade with China.\n  \n\n\nIndia has also proposed trade in national currencies with some other countries, including Russia, Iran and Venezuela. New Delhi has trade deficit with these three countries, too.The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) President Ganesh Kumar Gupta said that the government should promote exports from India in the domestic currency.\"This will help in bridging trade deficit with countries like China,\" Gupta said.Trade experts have stated that bilateral trade in domestic currencies will help India only in the case of those countries with which it has a trade balance.\"Trade imbalance should not be there with the country with which we want to do trade in rupee. It will not help in bridging the deficit. The partner country should have an opportunity to invest in India to use the rupee,\" said Biswajit Dhar, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.The Indian industry and exporters have time and again raised the issue of increasing trade deficit with China and have asked the government to seek greater market access for domestic goods in the Chinese market.Recently, China has permitted exports of rice and sugar. But India wants to increase exports of several other items, including pharmaceuticals, engineering and services.",

The manufacturing output grew at a robust 7.4 per cent on the back of a stronger industrial output.  The data, released by the Central Statistics Office, comes days after a joint exercise of CSO and NITI Aayog revised downwards the GDP growth for the UPA years between 2005-06 and 2011-12 based on the new base year 2011-12.The Narendra Modi-led NDA government is preparing to go into general elections next year on the back of a stronger economic growth compared to the UPA era.The first quarter GDP growth was mainly driven by robust growth in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) as it expanded by double digits for the second consecutive quarter (Q4FY18 and Q1FY19) and a pick up in demand in the rural sector.The RBI, in its last monetary policy framework, had projected the GDP growth for 2018-19 at 7.4 per cent (7.4 per cent in Q2 and 7.1-7.3 per cent in H2).The second half could see moderation in economic growth on the back of a liquidity crisis and a likely credit crunch triggered by the crisis in India's shadow banking sector. The economy could see support from the RBI's likely move to hold back any further hike in interest rates as the inflation is expected to remain within its comfort zone on the back of a sharp decline in international crude oil prices.",

These forecasts at constant (201112) prices are based on NCAER's annual GDP macro model,\" NCAER's Mid-Year Review of the Economy said.GDP growth rate at market prices estimated at 7.47.7 per cent for 201819, the report said.The growth rates of exports and imports, in dollar terms, are estimated at 11.8 per cent and 16.9 per cent respectively.The current account balance and central fiscal deficit, as percentages of GDP, are projected at -2.3 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively.NCAER said its estimates suggest that the combined output of kharif and rabi foodgrains during the current year may be in the region of 290 million tonnes, which is slightly higher than last year's record output.As per the report, the outlook for the Indian industrial sector remains mixed for current fiscal.Noting that after showing an uptick in the last quarter, almost all inflation metrics exhibited a decreasing trend, NCAER said,\" This was largely due to the deflationary trend exhibited in food prices. Inflation is expected to fall further in the next quarter due to moderating fuel prices.\" The NCAER also pointed out that the softening of headline CPI inflation in October 2018 and slump in global crude oil prices along with the pullback of the rupee in November 2018, reduce the chance of a rate hike at the RBI's bimonthly monetary policy meeting to be held on December 5, 2018.",

            "articleBody": "Most rating agencies have highlighted the risk of high government debt to GDP at 68 per cent and high combined fiscal deficit as an impediment for India's rating upgrade. Experts believe that the government may not deviate from fiscal consolidation track although the glide path is likely to be extended for FY18 and FY19 at 3.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent of GDP, respectively. NEW DELHI: The revised gross domestic product (GDP) data for fiscal years 2005-12 that lowered growth under the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, may have depressed India&rsquo;s long-term potential growth even though there is no directional change in the growth trend, independent economists said.HDFC Bank said though the back-series does not show any directional change compared to the old series, the maximum growth rate the economy achieved since 2004-05 now stands at 8.5 per cent for 2010-11, lower than the 10.3 per cent figure estimated earlier. &ldquo;This could suggest that the long-term potential growth rate for India might be lower than what was perceived earlier,&rdquo; said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank.The back series adjusts GDP numbers for the period using new methodology with the base year as FY12 and has scaled back growth in the UPA years from the peak of 10.3 per cent in FY11to 8.5 per cent. The new series also highlights that the contribution of the services sector was overestimated earlier and has been revised down. As per Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, the back series of GDP data highlights the volatility of Indian economic growth, with intermittent peaks in the pace of growth followed by dips.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;This suggests that sustaining a growth in excess of 8 per cent over an extended period of time may pose a challenge, particularly in the absence of a secularly supportive global growth environment,&rdquo; Nayar said. While there has been a minor change in GDP at current prices from FY05-FY11 (.`0.5 trillion to.`1.5 trillion), key ratios such as fiscal deficit/GDP or debt/GDP are calculated at current prices and hence, are unlikely to change significantly.&ldquo;Barring FY08, annual GDP year-on-year growth trend hasn&rsquo;t changed,&rdquo; said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist, India Ratings and Research. Economists have also questioned the approach followed on the expenditure side of the GDP, terming it simplistic. They said the splicing method could have exaggerated the past numbers due to which investment ratios in the back-series are looking higher for the previous years.Back series data shows deceleration in investment rate from 39.8 per cent in FY11to 30.6 per cent in FY18 and decline in gross savings rate to 29.6 per cent in FY17 from 36.2 per cent in FY11. These are major economic challenges which Indian economy is currently facing, Pant said. Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank, said, &ldquo;Directionally, the growth is same and only the levels are different. Moreover, an investment ratio of 30-35 per cent is &lsquo;normal&rsquo; for the Indian economy.&rdquo;About the difference between the GDP back series released by Central Statistics Office (CSO) and those released by the National Statistical Commission (NSC), an economist said the committee under NSC has used an approach that was an extrapolation exercise, whereas CSO&rsquo;s approach is a mix of extrapolation and usage of new data resources at hand.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley launched a strong defence of the new GDP series on Thursday saying it was a better reflection of the Indian economy and globally more comparable. A political slugfest erupted shortly after the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) unveiled data on the back series of GDP, which showed a downward revision in growth rates during the UPA era.\"Most experts, including those who have headed the CSO, have opined that this better represents the real state of the Indian economy. Obviously, when the new series is in place, it has to be used as a basis for backward revision,\" Jaitley said in a Facebook post.The FM also backed the CSO. \"The CSO under various governments has always functioned objectively. It maintains an arms length distance from the finance ministry. North Block becomes aware of the final figures only when they are released. It is an organisation that has global credibility,\" he said.The FM said the CSO changed the method of calculating GDP in 2015. GDP growth rate estimates were revised from 2012-13 onwards with 2011-12 being the base year. Since then, every quarter and annually, GDP data is released on that basis.Jaitley said the immediate impact of the revision based on the new GDP series was on the last two years of the UPA government. For the year 2012-13, the growth rate was revised from 4.7% to 5.1% and later again to 5.5%. The Congress Party's reaction is given by those who perhaps have a nodding acquaintance with the subject. Data based on facts and on the best global practices is rejected by the Party because it takes away the last of its surviving arguments \"my GDP growth was higher than yours\", the FM said.He said sooner the Congress Party realises that its policy paralysis pushed India into the fragile 5 (group of five countries), the better it will be for the Party and its leadership.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nNew Delhi: Indian shares inched up on Friday, with both the indexes marking their highest level in nearly two months, while the Indian rupee strengthened to a fresh 3-month high ahead of key economic growth data later in the day. Broader Asian markets wavered as investors remained cautious ahead of a crucial meeting between the Chinese and US presidents at the G20 meet during the weekend that could determine the course of a heated trade war over the next year.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan wobbled between positive and negative territory in early trade and was last up 0.4 per cent. Back home, investors were awaiting gross domestic product data which probably moderated to 7.4 per cent in the July-September quarter, according to a Reuters poll, weakening just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government gets set for an election due by May. The data is expected by 1200 GMT. The Indian rupee gained up to 0.35 per cent on the day to 69.595 per dollar, its best since Aug 21. The broader NSE Nifty was up 0.25 per cent at 10,885.45 as of 0608 GMT, while the benchmark BSE Sensex rose 0.27 per cent to 36,268.19. The broader NSE index breached its 10,900 level for the first time since Oct. 3, while the BSE index also clocked its best level in almost two months. \"Decline in international crude oil prices and strengthening of rupee are the positives today,\" said R.K. Gupta, managing director at Taurus Asset Management, adding that we may see some profit booking in the second-half after Thursday's rally in some specific stocks. \"Investors are also eyeing outcome of the G20 meet over the weekend,\" he said. Shares of Indian non-banking financial companies gained after the central bank relaxed rules to sell or securitise their loan books, in a bid to ease persistent stress in the sector. Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd's stock rose as much as 7.4 per cent, while those of Bajaj Finance Ltd gained up to 2.3 per cent, their highest since Sept. 19. IT firms were among the top performers on the Nifty, with Infosys Ltd up as much as 1.7 per cent. Meanwhile, shares in Tata Motors Ltd dropped as much as 3.9 per cent after its British unit Jaguar Land Rover said on Thursday it is going to cut 500 jobs temporarily at its plant in central England.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley will present the interim budget for 2019-20 fiscal on February 1, 2019.The finance ministry Wednesday said \"the work for preparation of interim Budget 2019-20 has already commenced and is now gaining momentum\".It has already sought inputs from different central ministries for the budget speech, which would be the last budget of the current BJP-led NDA government before the 2019 general polls.Last month, the ministry began the budgetary exercise for 2019-20. During the process, meetings were held with the ministries of steel, power, and housing and urban development, among others, to finalise revised expenditure for the current fiscal and projections for the next financial year.The ministry will impose quarantine from December 3, which will bar the entry of media persons into the North Block, the seat of the country's Finance Ministry, till the date of presentation of the interim Budget by the finance minister in Parliament on February 1, 2019, it said.This will be the sixth consecutive Budget to be presented by Jaitley.As per practice, a vote-on-account or approval for essential government spending for a limited period is taken in an election year and a full-fledged budget is presented by the new government.The Narendra Modi-led government scrapped the colonial-era tradition of presenting the budget at the end of February. With the preponement of budget, ministries are now allocated their budgeted funds from the start of the financial year beginning April.This gives government departments more leeway to spend as well as allow companies time to adapt to business and taxation plans.Previously, when the budget was presented at the end of February, the three-stage Parliament approval process used to get completed sometime in mid-May, weeks ahead of the onset of monsoon rains. This meant government departments would start spending on projects only from August-end or September after the monsoon season ended.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet on the sidelines of a G20 meeting this week, aiming to build on a thaw in ties after a military standoff on their disputed border last year, officials said. The 3,500 km (2,200-mile) border between the nuclear-armed neighbours has been calm since Modi and Xi held several hours of talks in the Chinese city of Wuhan in April, agreeing to prevent political disputes escalating into confrontation. Later this year, their two armies will hold joint exercises in a bid to build trust after their 73-day face-off in a remote, high-altitude stretch of the Himalayan border that stoked fears of war. Modi's meeting with Xi at the G20 summit in Argentina will be their fourth this year, Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said. \"It was decided that they would take the opportunity whenever and wherever they could meet. They could discuss issues on either leader's mind or issues of mutual concern,\" Gokhale told reporters. As well as long-standing disputes over their border, the two countries are vying for influence in the Indian Ocean and squabbling over Xi's signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. India has warmed up to the new government in the Maldives, offering financial help after it accused the previous government of striking secret deals with Chinese firms that have left the tiny country of 400,000 people in debt. India and China are also aligned with opposing sides embroiled in political turmoil in Sri Lanka. In Buenos Aires, the leaders of two of the world's fastest growing economies are expected to endorse efforts to liberalise their trade, Indian officials said.  Negotiators from the two countries held talks in New Delhi on Wednesday to try to prise open each other's farm markets.  China wants to export apples and dairy products and India is hoping to export skimmed milk products and buffalo meat, two Indian sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. India banned the import of Chinese apples in 2017 after finding pesticides, while China restricted imports of Indian buffalo meat because of concern over foot and mouth disease. Chinese Vice Minister Hu Wei and Indian Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan are leading the talks on the farm products as part of a broader trade package \"India's primary interest is exporting skimmed milk products and for China it is apples,\" one of the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the discussions. Their bilateral trade reached $89.6 billion in 2017/18 with a deficit of $62.9 billion in China's favour.  Indian officials said that China, locked in a trade dispute with the United States, has been more flexible than before with regard to the possible opening up of its markets to Indian pharmaceutical products and IT services.

This was the first time that the rupee breached the 70-mark since August this year.

This was taken by globally as a signal that the rate hike cycle was nearing its end.The domestic currency also gained on recent ease in crude oil prices and hopes of some positive developments in the US-China trade ties in the upcoming G20 summit. Dollar index, which compares the movement of dollar against a basket of six major world currencies, fell edged 0.09 per cent lower at 96.58.

A panel set up by National Statistical Commission had also calculated the back series that bumped up growth in the UPA era. The panel headed by Sudipto Mundle had, however, suggested that two other approaches also be used.",

The top 10 companies together accounted for 36 per cent of the total spending on CSR.The top spenders in terms of absolute CSR expenditure were Reliance Industries, ONGC, Tata Consultancy Services, HDFC Bank, Indian Oil Corp, Infosys, ITC, NTPC, Tata Steel and Wipro.Overall, 560 companies, or 59 per cent, increased their spending from the previous year.However, contributions to two government focus areas fell.Spending on Swachh Bharat declined 10 per cent to Rs 521 crore, while funding for the Clean Ganga project dropped 47 per cent to Rs 80 crore, data showed. The highest contribution towards Swachh Bharat was in 2015-16, at Rs 1,009 crore.As in the previous year, education received the most funding (38 per cent of the total), followed by healthcare (25 per cent). Spending was small in areas such as reducing inequalities (2 per cent), national heritage (4 per cent), armed forces (1 per cent), sports (2 per cent) and the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Relief Fund (2 per cent). However, in comparison to the previous year, these areas saw the highest percentage increase in spending, with the PM&rsquo;s fund attracting the biggest rise of 139 per cent.Allocations as a proportion of the total under various schedules remained fairly constant over the previous year, said Haldea.",

In a democracy, everybody need not agree at the same time on complex issues.Edited excerpts: On RBI vs Govt controversyI do not believe that the central bank and the finance ministry can agree on every issue. They need not disagree on every issue. But by a process of consultation and discussion at various levels, whatever we have done is to ensure that consultations take place. Let me put the record straight. Consultations have taken place at the level of the prime minister on several occasions. They have taken place at my level on innumerable occasions. They take place at the level of the secretaries on several occasions.Let me just define the elements &ndash; there are some issues which are completely in the domain of the government; some issues are completely in the domain of the central bank. There is no dispute. Ultimately after consultation, you exercise your respective functions. In some areas, the policy is laid down by the government. Certain measures have to be taken by the central bank. There has to be a coordination between the two. Therefore, a difference in perspective does not mean that it is an institutional failure. In a democracy on complex issues, everybody need not agree at the same time.On Raghuram Rajan who was picked by the UPA governmentArun Jaitley: Not in the least. I have maintained utmost courtesies with the institution as also with the individuals who have manned these institution.But he resigned. Arun Jaitley: You are again factually wrong. He had a three-year term. He completed his three-year term. Your colleagues in the media made it out as though he has resigned. He did not resign. He completed his three-year term. On Urjit Patel, a man NDA government selected. You may not be on the same page with your co-anchors or colleagues on but that does not mean the institution has collapsed. In democracy, you are meant to disagree on several issues. Otherwise, it will become meaningless. Now the government&rsquo;s view point is -- we respect and we will always maintain the autonomy within the framework of the laws which have been laid down. At the same time, if there are sectors of the economy which are starved of either liquidity or credit, as a sovereign government which represents the people and which has the larger interest of the economy in mind, we certainly will flag those issues. The common man feels the government wants RBI&rsquo;s Rs 3.6 lakh crore reserves for financing the election year expenditure. Who has said this? It can be said only by those who took India&rsquo;s fiscal deficit to 6% when they had the responsibility. We have nothing of this sort in mind. Let us first tell your so-called common man as to what fiscal deficit is. How much does the government collect and how much does the government spend. If you spend beyond your earnings, that is your fiscal deficit because you are borrowing from the markets. You are then going to leave your next generation in debt. During the UPA, it went haywire and went as high as 6%. We inherited a 4.6% fiscal deficit. This government since 1947 in its five-year tenure has the best record of fiscal prudence that any government has had.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: The GDP growth in the September quarter is expected to decelerate to 7.5-7.6 per cent over the previous three-month period mainly due to slowdown in rural demand, an SBI research report said Monday.The GDP growth at constant prices (2011-12) was 8.2 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2018-19.The Central Statistics Office (CSO) will be releasing the estimates for GDP growth for July-September on Friday.The 'SBI Ecowrap' report said the SBI Composite Leading Indicator (CLI), a basket of 21 leading indicators for September quarter of the current fiscal, is showing a marginal declining trend.Consequently, the headline second quarter Gross Value Added (GVA) growth could be 7.3-7.4 per cent, due to the slowing of rural demand, it said.\"We also believe that the growth numbers in the second quarter will be helped by a weak base in September quarter 2017-18.\"We estimate that the base impact on second quarter GVA growth is around 30 bps. Based on tax collections, we subsequently expect second quarter GDP growth at 7.5-7.6 per cent,\" said Ecowrap.It further said commercial vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic and cement production have maintained double-digit growth during July-September quarter. All these indicators pushed up GVA in the quarter.The monthly data of various indicators for October 2018 however suggest the GVA growth is slowing down due to decline in demand, the report said.\"Of particular concern, is that non-food credit, bank deposits and sale of passenger and commercial vehicles have slowed down as compared to previous month,\" it said.Also with a slowdown in government spending in the second quarter , the fiscal impulses to growth would now be clearly missing, the report added.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nMUMBAI: The Reserve Bank has \"more than adequate\" reserves and that it can transfer over Rs 1 trillion to the government after a specially constituted panel identifies the \"excess capital\", says a report.An RBI board meeting had last Monday decided to form a committee, which is likely to be announced later this week.ALSO READ: Government may raise PCA issue again if norms not eased by RBI\"We expect the proposed committee on the RBI's economic capital framework (ECF) to identify Rs 1-3 trillion which is 0.5-1.6 per cent of GDP as excess capital,\" analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note Monday.The brokerage report said as per its stress tests, the central bank can transfer Rs 1 trillion to the government if the transfer is limited to passing excess contingency reserve and can go up to Rs 3 trillion if the total capital is included.Giving a break-up, the report said Rs 1.05 trillion can be transferred if the contingency reserve is capped at 3.5 percent of the RBI book. It further said this level will be 75 percent higher than the average of BRICS economies, excluding India.ALSO READ: RBI may hold the rates baton till March: ReportAdditional forms of transfers can include Rs 1.16 trillion from the contingency reserves if one restricts to yield rise of 4.5 percent as against 9 percent at present.Limiting the appreciation cover in RBI's currency and gold revaluation account to 25 percent (Rs 53.25 per USD) will release about Rs 72,000 crore to the government, it said.It also said capping the overall reserves at 20 percent of the RBI's book as against 28.3 percent now and higher than 18 percent recommended by the Usha Thorat panel will be able to release Rs 3.11 trillion.The statutes do not prohibit transfer of excess capital to the government, it said, pointing out that the RBI Act places no bar as long as government maintains Rs 5 crore of reserve funds under Sec 46 of the RBI Act.While Section 47 enjoins the RBI to credit its annual surplus to the national exchequer, after provisions, it does not place any restrictions on further transfers, it added.The RBI's contingency reserves at 7 percent are higher than the BRICS (excluding India) average of 2 percent, it said, adding the revaluation reserves are also on the higher side relative to BRICS central banks.As per a press statement after the nine-hour marathon board meeting, the government and RBI will be jointly deciding on the panel constitution and also its terms of reference.Following widespread criticism from many quarters, finance minister Arun Jaitley had said over the weekend that government did not need any support from the RBI's reserves for the next six months. However, multiple reports had claimed that the government is eyeing the extra cash which will help it in the run-up to the elections.This comes amidst falling GST collections and little borrowing window left for the government, as it has already used up close to 96 percent of borrowings as of end October. By taking the money from the RBI, the government will only increase its fiscal deficit, as it will have to issue bonds to the central bank.The government for the second year in a row has pegged fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of GDP this fiscal year. Many analysts are expecting government to overshoot this by at least 20-30 bps by March.",

The country had no doubt achieved growth but it was not \"enough\" to meet the aspirations of the freedom fighters who had drafted the Constitution, the NGT chairman regretted while speaking at a function at the Raj Bhavan here on the eve of Constitution Day. \"Our economy is growing very fast, we have a place of pride in the world as a nation. But we have a large umber of people below the poverty line. We have people who are deprived of food ... there are people who are deprived of shelter and clothes,\" Justice Goel said.  He said, in many districts of Odisha, there are people who do not have sufficient clothes to cover their body. They use only one piece of cloth to cover their body even after 70 years of independence.  Stating that legislators, administrators, politicians judges, and lawyers are committed to ensure that justice is served, he said, \"Justice means we must guarantee minimum need to all.\" Assam governor Jagdish Mukhi said the Indian Constitution is a fine blend of securing its peoples fundamental rights and realisation of the aspirations of the people in the directive principles. \"We have a Constitution that is robust, comprehensive, stable and dynamic enough to realise the aspirations of our people.\" Speaking on the history of the Constitution, Vice Chancellor of National Law University and Judicial Academy, Assam, Dr J S Patil said the Constituent Assembly had adopted the Constitution of India on November 26, 1949 and it came into force later on January 26, 1950.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India will focus on boosting its exports to the US and other global markets as Chinese shipments become unattractive amid a trade war between the world&rsquo;s biggest economies, the country&rsquo;s trade minister said.New Delhi is focusing on a handful of items including automotive parts, chemicals, electrical equipment, among others, after the US and China slapped reciprocal duties on each other&rsquo;s goods, minister Suresh Prabhu said in an interview. India&rsquo;s share in global merchandise exports is at 1.7 per cent compared to China&rsquo;s 12.8 per cent.&ldquo;The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China may have positive impact,\" Prabhu said in a written reply to questions. &ldquo;The long term strategy is to focus on enhancing manufacturing capabilities with focus not only on the United States but also keeping in view the demands in other markets, as well.&rdquo;With President Donald Trump expected to go ahead with another round of tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China in January, India looks to gain from opportunities from the dispute. Southeast Asia, a region that&rsquo;s mastered export competitiveness, is already seeing a boom in foreign direct investment as the trade war prompts companies to shift production to the region.Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s administration has been exploring ways to close the gap between exports and imports which reached $17.1 billion in October. The government has imposed some import curbs to ease pressure on the current-account deficit, a key vulnerability for the economy and one of the reasons why the rupee has lost more than 11 per cent against the dollar this year.The rising tensions could derail established trade orders like the World Trade Organization and will hurt smaller nations, Prabhu said.&ldquo;This is not a welcome development for sustaining a free and fair trade,&rdquo; he said.",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: The government feels more needs to be done on liquidity to ensure NBFCs can start lending. In an interview to ET, department of economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg tells ET government will meet its fiscal deficit target and RBI&rsquo;s governance structure needs to be reviewed. Edited excerpts from an interview with Deepshikha Sikarwar &amp; Vinay Pandey.The rupee and oil have both reversed. Are you treating this as temporary, or is the problem behind us?Oil is a very special commodity. A 2% shortfall in supply in comparison to demand or 2% supply being in excess of demand can make the prices go haywire one way or the other. At some stage, I thought it would reverse and might go to less than $60 (to a barrel). It has reversed very fast and gone to about $63-64. That has an impact on our current account, the easing of concern on the rupee account has an impact on the behaviour of FPIs (foreign portfolio investors) and others. In October, there was a large withdrawal of money from India. Now you have seen them coming back. So the fundamental situation has changed. We would like to believe that this has changed for good&hellip; but oil being oil, you can never be certain, so you can&rsquo;t take it as a permanent reversal kind of thing. At this moment, we should keep watch, see how durable this reversal is and then take additional decisions.Has it created a situation where excise duty cuts can be reversed because states, which levy taxes on fuel on an ad valorem basis, were also asked to undertake cuts.We don&rsquo;t want to get into that kind of mindset. We need to watch for some more time. The relief on Iranian oil is said to be for six months. I think we should watch for some time more to see whether there should be any policy reversal.There is some concern about the fiscal deficit. There have been some murmurs about spending cuts...I don&rsquo;t think anybody has been asked to cut expenditure that would have been approved for them. It is usual (that) most of the ministries and departments ask for additional funds. During the budget finalisation consultation (BFC) process, all these things are discussed and then a fair amount is allocated, which may even be larger than the one (sought). Only in those cases where the ministry&rsquo;s implementation of the programme is such that there is virtually no likelihood of the entire allocated funds being utilised, then in RE (revised estimates) allocations are proposed to be reduced. But there is no such situation that we have to reduce allocations because we don&rsquo;t have enough revenue streams. There is no forced reduction at all.What does that mean for the fiscal deficit?We are completely on track. We will achieve 3.2% (of GDP). The BFC is also done for the next year. As per our medium-term fiscal framework, next year we are supposed to go up to 3.1%. We hope to do better than that.You said India is fiscally comfortable, so how is the bank recapitalisation plan working out?We are comfortable. I won&rsquo;t say we are excessively comfortable. For bank capitalisation, we have Rs 65,000 crore provisioned for this year. Part of that has been used. The capitalisation requirement might also undergo a change if the yields get further reduced. The mark-to-market provision might come down. There are very positive signals on the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) process. So you keep on assessing the capital requirement. There is some work which is being done that there might be some additional thing but I think more recent developments would need to be taken into account.So, there will be a fresh assessment?Yes.There are reports about the telecom sector staring at a default, so will North Block press for a spectrum auction?We have not seen any evidence of defaults so far. Two, for spectrum auction, there is a policy in place. What should be auctioned, what should not--that discussion is going on. There are certain issues about fixing a reasonable reserve price. Those are also being taken. As soon as it is ready, the auctions will be conducted.There is a suggestion from DoT on a reverse auction. Is that something that would acceptable?What you try to achieve is the best mode of auction which gives you the best price, keeping in consideration that we now have the new digital communication policy in place which also lays down different interests that it should serve. Balancing those interests, whatever should be the best mode of auctioning should be used.The telecom industry is also looking at some sort of relief package &ndash; moratorium on payments, as also staggered payments.This subject was examined by a subcommittee sometime back. Its findings were approved and payments due over 10 years were rescheduled to 16 years.Now the telecom industry is said to be seeking 18 years...The maximum licensing period is about 20 years. Last time also when it was done, it was done on a discounted basis in a manner that there is no net adverse impact on the government. I think a view would be taken, but whatever view is taken, no fiscal loss will be taken.There is some concern that liquidity constraints may hit growth. Moody&rsquo;s has flagged this. Do you think the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has done enough or more steps are needed?In the latter part of September and October, some of the NBFCs (nonbanking finance companies) faced a liquidity crunch. They were not able to get their papers rolled over, there were rising interest rates etc. Our sense is that the liquidity situation in terms of the solvency aspect of it that some NBFCs might fall or that kind of situation--I think that is not there at all now with the liquidity situation also improving to some extent, measures taken by the government, RBI and all. But growth in this space was very high, in some cases even exceeding 40-50% a year. They were funding consumption expenditure, they were funding infrastructure financing, they were also funding housing, other real estate &ndash; lot of areas were basically funded by these NBFCs. Their flow of funds has certainly got reduced.First, they were trying to remain solvent. Second, now they are trying to refinance themselves with better asset-liability management. Many of them have reduced disbursements and they are not taking new exposure. This situation still requires support of liquidity and I think we need to continue to help manage the economy in such a way, the financial system in such a way, that they do get enough liquidity for at least their normal growth if not the extraordinary growth they were having. I hope we should be able to ensure this working with the Reserve Bank.You are saying some liquidity is required for growth?Yes, that is correct. Otherwise there would be some adverse impact.The RBI-government relationship has been in focus in recent times. Can we now say all is well? Are you satisfied with the outcome at the last board meeting on November 19?The Reserve Bank is an extremely important institution for the financial and economic management of the country. The government and the Reserve Bank have to work together to steer the economy to higher growth. The relationship between the government and the Reserve Bank is also quite multidimensional if I can put it that way. In my department itself, we must be on average writing something like two to three letters a day on different aspects. We interact on financial markets, currency, foreign exchange management and several other aspects. There is a very detailed, comprehensive, consultative interactive mechanism. Many times the media and analysts focus on the smaller part of the relationship--monetary management or reserve management.Second, the consultative mechanism between the two is also of a different colour and different dimension. For example, if I can give one instance, for foreign exchange management, the law says that for debt instruments, whether it is ECB (external commercial borrowings) or other kind of loans, borrowings, liabilities and guarantees etc., the regulations, rules will be made by the Reserve Bank of India in consultation with the government. For non-debt instruments, the law says the rules will be made by the government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India. So, there are enormous ways and means by which consultation takes place.Monetary policy over the years rightly recognised that there may be some situations where the government might be running a fiscal policy in a manner which may not be may not be conducive to inflation management. Before 2016, it was the governor who was in charge of monetary policy. In 2016, the Act was amended. Now we have formed a monetary policy committee. But even there, the inflation target is legally set by the government. Then the Reserve Bank is supposed to achieve that.It is such an intricately constructed relationship that I don&rsquo;t think anyone can say this is supreme, this is not supreme or this is independent, this is not so independent. Very carefully instruments have been created, something which is, let us say, very close to independence. To my mind, this means that the Reserve Bank can say or act against what the government is doing. Those situations can also arise sometimes. As I said, if you are running a fiscal policy in such a way that there is expansion of money, debt is expanding and things like that, then the Reserve Bank should have the instruments to control money supply even if the government doesn&rsquo;t like it. The present context is not that at all.The government is running a fiscal policy in a manner which I think serves the purpose of inflation management. Who has done this kind of fiscal consolidation in our history for some time--deliberately planning and bringing down the fiscal deficit? But maybe there was a situation in 2008-09 or 2009-10 when we had also launched stimulus, inflation was 10% or 11%--maybe that was the situation where Reserve Bank could have exercised that independence of authority that is there. My sense is that let&rsquo;s understand this relationship in its true sense. I don&rsquo;t think we have any situation which can be problematic. It&rsquo;s a situation which is going on, consultations are going on. The other aspect we should also see is that there is an evolution of the relationship or the evolution of the Reserve Bank of India itself. Those days, when we used to automatically monetise the deficit, the undersecretary here used to issue ad-hoc treasury bills, which would automatically lead to money expansion. All those days are gone. Several things have evolved, the governance structure was also evolving. The current structure of the committees etc. the Reserve Bank has was laid down in (19)49 and things like that. The way the world makes regulations has also changed. The complexity of the financial system, its integration globally has also changed. So, I think it&rsquo;s legitimate to take stock of the situation and improve upon if that is functionally required.What really put the focus on the relationship was the never-used Section 7 being cited in communications between the government and the RBI. Deputy governor Viral Acharya&rsquo;s October speech brought the tension into public view.I can say that that speech was bit unfortunate. By the way it (the government) did not use Section 7. Normally, the central banks use much more guarded language. There are also a lot of misgivings about this Section 7. In the architecture of the governance structure, there are three main players. One is the central government, another is the central board and the governor and the deputy governors. Section 7 essentially refers to the direction the government can give about the governance structure of the Reserve Bank. The way it is worded like this &ndash; &ldquo;subject to the directions of the government, board of the directors of the central board&hellip;&rdquo;Section 7 can also be used to do consultation like the various ways like I referred. Legal consultation of Fema (Foreign Exchange Management Act) is also a law-based consultation. In fact, the trigger came from somewhere else. There was a case in the Allahabad High Court and I am told it was even suggested by the Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s attorney there that Section 7 consultation can be used in the process. So, the court said that you carry out consultation under Section 7--so that is where it started. You set about consultation process on that, then some of these other issues also came up. There is nothing like nuclear option, as if some Bramhastra is being fired. It&rsquo;s one of the ways of doing consultation and that&rsquo;s all we have done.Earlier you said the situation has changed and so there needs to be a change in the way institutions function in terms of composition and the powers that committees, subcommittees, boards have. Is there a need for another look at these structures?There is the governance agenda, which is coming up for discussion at the December 14 RBI central board meeting. There are certain proposals to look at this precisely for the reasons that I explained earlier. I think jointly discussing, we should come up with something.What is the object behind seeking a review of the RBI&rsquo;s capital framework? The impression is that the government wants Rs 3.6 lakh crore of Reserve Bank&rsquo;s surplus.Sometimes imaginations run wild. At no stage, it (transfer of Rs 3.6 lakh crore surplus) has been proposed. I am not referring to the academic exercise that the chief economic advisor undertook and presented it as part of the Economic Survey--that&rsquo;s a different exercise. He also brought up certain other things such as the universal basic income. That&rsquo;s a separate exercise, it&rsquo;s not a government proposal. The government has at no stage asked for transfer of any reserves or buffer. There has been no proposal at any point in time.The main significance of the economic capital framework of the Reserve Bank lies in deciding how much of the profits of each year the Reserve Bank transfers to the government. Statutorily, it has been provided for in Section 47 of the RBI Act, which says after you have made provisions for bad and doubtful debt, which the Reserve Bank does not have, make provisions for depreciation and for any other purpose you are required to make. And then there is one open-ended thing that that you should make provisions on the lines of what bankers normally do, which is prudential risk related.Once you have written that formula that how much capital would you need, then you compare with the amount of the capital you are holding. If the Reserve Bank is holding less capital than what the reserves require, then you should not distribute full profits, you retain a part. That&rsquo;s the construct. It is not for the first time that the economic capital framework determination or this provision business is being done. We have had the V Subrahmanyam committee, we have had the Usha Thorat committee. The last look was done by YH Malegam in 2014. He at that time had come to the conclusion that the Reserve Bank is holding Rs 1.49 lakh crore extra. At that time, Malegam made a recommendation, which was accepted by the board, that for next three years you transfer 100% to the government. And, at the end of the three years we will see.The capital framework adopted in 2016 in our judgement adopted principles and formulae that were much more extreme than what in our judgement define the test of what normally bankers would hold. Therefore, we have been asking the Reserve Bank from the last one year or so that let&rsquo;s have a review of the economic capital framework. This has now been agreed to and a committee will look into it very objectively.It will study the practices world over as to how other central banks do it and then come out with its own formulation. This time, to avoid (the perception) that it is unilateral or something there would be some representation of the government also and representation of the Reserve Bank. It would be headed by someone independent, someone eminent who knows the central bank and the government. Hopefully, it will be constituted very soon. Then it will take some time to come out with its recommendations and then those will be taken by the board.Will it be in place before the December 14 meeting?Certainly--both the finance minister and governor will decide and constitute it.There is a view in some quarters that the government does not have much say in the internal committees that will discuss issues such as the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework in which it has sought changes.Why should we pre-judge anything? If something has been agreed to be jointly referred to BFS (Banking Financial Supervision committee), let BFS do its business and it come to the board.Would the government seek reconstitution of the BFS committee?I would not like to specifically comment on any committee. As part of governance reforms, the larger institutional structure would be looked at.What is the status on the Payments Regulatory Board? The RBI has made its dissent on the committee&rsquo;s recommendations public.I think some clarification is in order on it. There is a joint report of recommendations that the RBI has signed on to. That report describes the differences only on one essential aspect. There is no difference on the view that there should be an independent regulator on the payments side. In fact, a kind of independent regulator has already been created by way of amendment to the Finance Act--the Payments Regulatory Board. The essential difference was whether the head of the payments regulator or payments settlement board should be the governor himself or another person with central banking experience.Most people in the committee felt it should not be ex officio as it requires much more of attention, so should be full time. But the central banking experience is essential. So the committee recommended that the chairman should be someone with considerable central banking experience, but not the governor ex officio. The RBI representative said it should be the central bank governor and that has been noted in the report. What later on came up in dissent the note, it has some other first principles also that have been discussed. But those had been settled very well. There is no open discussion about that. We now have to consult everyone formally as it is a recommendation of a group. We have to have consultations with the law department and also the RBI. So we are processing it for consultations.There is some speculation about this year&rsquo;s budget, whether it will be a full one or interim or interim-plus.The convention is that in the interim budget we present estimates for entire next year. There have been one or two exceptions, but for the last 50-60 years, this has been the standard practice. Full budget is presented when the new government takes over with full policy announcements and full taxation proposals. That&rsquo;s my sense should happen this year. I have no other instructions at this moment.",

            "articleBody": " The US dollar has had a strong run this year. The strength in the currency has surprised many investors. While one might have expected that dollar is overvalued and would lose its strength in the second half of the year, clearly that has not happened.So what is causing dollar to outperform?Perhaps the most influential factor for the dollar aside from sentiment is interest rate hikes. US Federal Reserve rates continue to rise while European rates have not moved in years. Dollar is the benchmark pricing mechanism for most commodities, which are global assets.Base metals that trade on the LME and precious metals such as gold, silver and energy -- including crude oil and natural gas -- use the dollar to price.Rising dollar has significant ramifications for commodities, as higher dollar tends to weigh on commodity prices. Production cost of raw material in other countries rise because of strong dollar and weighs negative on demand. In the stock market, higher US dollar weighs on US multinational companies, as they have to compete globally with strong a currency. The increase interest rate differential between the US and other countries have supported the value of US dollar.\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe gap between the yields paid by US dollar and Euro is at 2.40-2.65 per cent. The US Fed has given sufficient hint that they will increase 25 basis point hike in December, so interest rate differential is set to widen further to 2.65-2.90 per cent. Euro and US inflation has stabilised near 2 per cent, but there is difference in GDP growth and unemployment rate.GDP growth is higher in the US and unemployment rate is lower compared with euro, which naturally makes the dollar stronger against the euro and other currencies. \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTaking this into account, we expect US dollar to outperform against other currencies. Meanwhile, rupee is at strong support zone of 71.40. Both down trendline and 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement (High: 74.68, Low: 68.18) merges near 71.40. RSI_14 is at 33 and on the verge of coming in oversold territory. We believe the appreciation in dollar-rupee was purely on back of low crude oil prices and now there is less room for the unit to appreciate.We expect currency to bottom out around 70.70 and then may start getting depreciated. \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n(Bhavik Patel is Senior Technical Analyst of Commodities at Tradebulls Securities)",

MUMBAI: Percentage of employable population in the country grew to a new high of 47 per cent this year, an increase of almost 2-3 percentage points since last year, with engineers being the most employable class, a report said Thursday. The employability rose by 14 percentage points in the last five years, from 33 per cent in 2014, according to India Skills Report, a joint initiative of Wheebox, PeopleStrong and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Around 57 per cent of the final-year engineering graduates were found to be employable, an increase of about five percentage points since last year, the report said. The employability amongst masters of business administration (MBA) graduates, however, has dropped by three percentage points over last year, the report said, without specifying the exact number. \"It seems that with exponential increase in the number of MBA colleges, the quality of talent is seen to be declining,\" it added. The report also found that there has been a drop in employability of bachelor of pharmacy (BPharma) graduates. Among the states, Andhra Pradesh topped the list with highest employability, followed by Rajasthan and Haryana, which have made their entry into the top 10 ranking for the first time. Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Punjab moved out from the top 10 list this year. There has been an increasing presence of employable talent in tier-II and III cities, according to the report. \"This trend can be seen in spite of lack of big institutions such as IITs and IIMs or any other renowned institutes in tier II and III cities,\" it added. Wheebox founder and chief executive officer Nirmal Singh said the employability touching 47 per cent is good sign for the market. \"But we have a long way to go and entire ecosystem should focus on bridging the employability gaps, enhancing the talent pool, thus taking measures from school level to professional level focusing on learning,\" he added. The report took into account 5,200 universities and professional institutions in the country, with over three lakh students across 29 states and seven Union territories.",

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has Donald Trump and the oil market to thank for the Indian rupee&rsquo;s best weekly run since March 2016.The currency extended a seven-day winning streak to push beyond its 100-day moving average for the first time since February, as falling crude prices soften inflationary expectations and take pressure off the central bank to raise interest rates. A relative strength index showed trading momentum favors the rupee by the most since early January.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reprieve couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time for Modi, whose re-election bid in less than six months looks increasingly strained amid deepening social divides, a banking system saddled with bad loans, and mounting tension between the government and the Reserve Bank of India. The opposition has used the rupee&rsquo;s 10 depreciation this year to criticize his economic management.\n  \n\n\nIndia&rsquo;s economy imports most of its energy needs, and an almost 50 per cent surge in the cost of Brent crude priced in rupees from January through October threatens to put a hole in the budget. What&rsquo;s worse, the government is stepping up social spending before general elections in 2019.Despite this bleak backdrop, India&rsquo;s economy is marching on. Gross domestic product grew at a better-than-forecast 8.2 per cent rate in the second quarter, and inflation fell in three of the past four months to the lowest level since September 2017. While the trade-deficit last month was wider than expected, oil&rsquo;s continued decline might help narrow the gap in November.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nNEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices extended decline to a third session on Thursday, tracking weakness in global shares and uncertainty regarding the state elections outcome. Heavy selling was witnessed in metals, banking and realty counters.A firm rupee and a slide in crude oil prices did little to lift the mood on Dalal Street.Equity, commodity and forex markets will remain closed for trading on Friday on account of Guru Poornima.On the day, BSE benchmark Sensex slipped below the 35,000 mark and settled 218.78 points or 0.62 per cent lower at 34,981.02. Meanwhile, NSE Nifty closed the day at 10,526.75, down 73.30 points or 0.69 per cent.The 30-share index witnessed a swing of 427 points during the day. Only five Sensex stocks closed the day higher with Adani Ports leading the gainers. M&amp;M, with a loss of 3.02 per cent, was the worst index performer. It was followed by Tata Steel, Wipro, Axis Bank, Coal Indian and Power Grid. These shares shed between 2.28 per cent and 1.59 per cent.On the BSE, barring capital goods index, all other indices ended lower. Metals, telecom, power, realty, basic materials and energy were the worst hit sectors on BSE and shed up to 1.84 per cent.BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap fell in line with Sensex and closed with losses of 0.74 per cent and 0.44 per cent respectively.In Nifty, 10 stocks closed in the green while 40 closed in the red. Only Nifty Media index, with gains of 1.42 per cent closed the day higher, rest all other indices shut shop on a tepid note.Key factors that weighed on the market:1. Weakness in global markets: Europe's markets dropped into the red on Thursday, as investor worries mounted over slowing global growth in the face of rising US interest rates and trade tensions. Chinese markets extended their slump in Asia amid the trade war with the United States, and with Wall Street closed later for Thanksgiving, Europe followed suit.2. Heavy selling in metals and bank stocks: Metals and banking counters came under heavy selling pressure on Thursday with both the indices shedding over a per cent higher on Nifty. In the Nifty PSU Bank index, all constituents ended the day in the red while. Nifty Metal index dropped 1.77 per cent with only one stock in the green.3. Election woes: Investors remained jittery ahead of the outcome of elections in five states.Bloomberg quoted Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Joindre Capital Services as saying that markets will remain volatile in the next six to nine months - either up or down - and investors will have to play the volatility to their advantage. &ldquo;Oil price is a crucial factor for Indian equities and politics is a wild card and they will decide the direction of stocks near term,&rdquo; Gorakshakar added.Expert takeMarket failed to hold the opening gains as weak global market and selling in metals and PSU banks dragged the indices. Global growth concerns due to trade war, rising interest rate and lower liquidity in the financial markets added to the woes. However, rise in US crude oil inventory and expectation of slow pace in FED rate hike in CY19 could provide some support- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesVolatility struck the bourses, as the key benchmark indices erased intraday gains to sink in negative zone. On the sectoral front, barring the media index which gained over 1%, all other sectoral indices on the NSE closed the day with sharp losses- Abhijeet Dey, Senior Fund Manager-Equities, BNP Paribas MF",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Sliding crude oil prices have bolstered the rupee, until recently the worst-performing monetary unit in Asia, and helped revive overseas interest in Indian equity and debt assets.This month, the local unit has gained 2.79 per cent against the dollar, Bloomberg data showed, making the rupee the third best performer after the Chilean peso and the Indonesian rupiah.The rupee closed at 71.46 to a dollar on Tuesday. Currency and debt markets in Mumbai were shut on Wednesday due to the Eid festival.Overseas investors have resumed purchases of domestic assets as a 17 percent slump in crude prices this month should boost corporate profits and reduce concerns over a runaway current account deficit.&ldquo;Falling crude prices make India assets attractive to overseas investors,\" said Gopikrishnan MS, head of foreign exchange, rates and credit for South Asia at Standard Chartered in Mumbai. &ldquo;The rupee now has ground to gain due to the expected fall in trade deficit. The local unit can rise another 2-3 per cent by this year end.&rdquo;Foreign funds have been net buyers of domestic securities in November. They have net invested Rs 10,523 crore so far, showed data from the National Securities Depository. More than half of the money came into debt securities at Rs 5,686 crore, the highest monthly inflow this financial year.The rupee faced multiple headwinds during the year from rising oil prices, the widening trade deficit, and a liquidity stress in the para-banking industry. All these factors have collectively weighed on the rupee.&ldquo;Many of these factors have either been resolved or have been temporarily managed,&rdquo; said Gopikrishnan.Brent crude has fallen more than 25 percent since the four-year high of $86.74 reached on October 3 this year. There are apprehensions of a supply glut, with expectations of a demand contraction next year. The benchmark gauge now hovers around $63.5 per barrel.India&rsquo;s current account deficit (CAD), or the excess of overseas spending over revenues, was 2.4 per cent of GDP in the June quarter.The fall in oil prices should help reduce India&rsquo;s fuel import bills while aiding companies with higher share of imports to reduce operational costs.&ldquo;With moderation in oil prices and the consequent resumption in FII inflows, the fear of sustained deterioration in India&rsquo;s CAD and balance of payment has been put to rest,&rdquo; said B Prasanna, group executive and head of markets at ICICI Bank. &ldquo;The rupee has recovered substantial ground and is likely to appreciate more if oil prices sustain at the current levels.&rdquo;The rupee has otherwise been one of the worst performing emerging market currencies this calendar year. The central bank has been reportedly intervening in the market selling dollars via state-owned banks.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;Undershooting of the current inflation readings, the benign inflation trajectory, and the potential liquidity additive measures including OMO purchases from the RBI add to the positive environment for rates,&rdquo; said Prasanna.Open Market Operation is a device to manage banking system liquidity.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nNew Delhi: Most Asian currencies firmed slightly on Thursday as the dollar's softening after two strong sessions restored some appetite for emerging-market risk. Sentiment was further lifted by a dip in oil prices, as most major regional economies are net importers of the commodity and any fall should aid key economic indicators. Oil-induced volatility very much remains on the table, Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank said in a note. To him, the \"cat among the pigeons\" for the oil market remains \"complex US-Saudi geo-politics\". The Indian rupee, resuming trade after a holiday on Wednesday and gains the first two days this week, was the top gainer, firming as much as 0.5 per cent to hit a fresh 11-week high of 71.110 against the dollar. Both the Thai baht and the Korean won strengthened as much as 0.3 per cent, but the Thai currency gave up its gains. Thailand's central bank governor on Thursday said it sees less need for very low interest rates, which will remain accommodative even as there is policy tightening, suggesting a rate hike could still come soon. The Indonesian rupiah advanced 0.24 per cent. The Philippine peso and the Malaysian ringgit also had marginal gains. Safe-haven currencies such as the dollar, Japanese yen and Swiss franc had been bolstered by a two-day sell-off on Wall Street but higher US stocks and a stronger euro dented the greenback. US economic data also did not help the dollar as new orders for key locally-made capital goods were unexpectedly unchanged in October, while the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits rose to a more than four-month high last week.  The Singapore dollar weakened slightly, falling as much as 0.1 per cent, on news Singapore's economy expanded at a much slower pace than initially thought in the third quarter. The government flagged further moderation in the current quarter and warning that the US-Sino trade war will hurt growth in 2019. The economy grew 3.0 per cent in the July-September quarter from the previous three months on an annualised and seasonally adjusted basis, revised final figures from Ministry of Trade and Industry showed on Thursday. OCBC Treasury Research analysts said in a note that the full impact on Singapore economy from the dual headwinds of escalation of Sino-US trade conflicts and faster-than-expected tightening of global financial conditions has been fairly muted in 2018's second half and will be likely postponed to 2019.

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) transferred around Rs 2.5 lakh crore to the government during the last five years, which was around 75 per cent of the central bank's income.While analysing the government's finance account last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General studied RBI's income, expenditure and surplus transferred to the Centre between 2013-14 and 2017-18 and found that out of its income of Rs 3.3 lakh crore, the central bank had transferred Rs 2.48 lakh crore. The highest payout was in 2015-16, when 83 per cent of the RBI's income was transferred to the Centre as surplus.RBI's reserves have been a bone of contention, with the government keen to increase the payout. What has added to the discord in recent years is the Economic Survey pointing out that RBI has higher reserves than other central banks.In the recent past, RBI has been transferring surplus of around Rs 65,000 crore annually to the government, barring 2017 when its expenditure more than doubled to Rs 31,000 crore. Till 2016-17, the RBI's expenditure remained below Rs 15,000 crore but shot up due to higher cost of printing currency notes at the time of demonetisation.In a speech last month, RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya had hit out at the government for seeking higher dividend and cited the example of Argentina, where a similar development took place eight years ago, to argue that the central bank's autonomy should not be compromised. The issue was one of the key agenda items at the marathon board meeting of the RBI.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Moody's Investors Service Tuesday said RBI board's decision to extend the timeline for banks to implement Basel 3 guidelines is \"credit negative\" for public sector lenders. Also, the decision to restructure stressed micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) loans of up to Rs 25 crore also has the potential for having negative implications for the credit profiles of Indian banks, the US-based rating agency said in a statement.  Amid growing tension between the government and the central bank, the RBI board met Monday and discussed issues to boost funding to MSMEs and ease capital pressure on banks.\n At the nine-hour long marathon meeting, the board advised that the RBI should consider a scheme for restructuring of stressed standard assets of MSME borrowers with aggregate credit facilities of up to Rs 25 crore, subject to such conditions as are necessary for ensuring financial stability.\n \"While more details are awaited, this approach has the potential for negative implications for the credit profiles of Indian banks,\" Moody's Investors Service Vice President (Financial Institutions Group) Srikanth Vadlamani said in a statement.\n The RBI board, while deciding to retain the capital adequacy requirement for banks at 9 per cent, agreed to extend the transition period for implementing the last tranche of 0.625 per cent under the capital conservation buffer (CCB), by one year - up to March 31, 2020.\n CCB currently stands at 1.875 per cent and remaining 0.625 per cent was to be met by March 2019, as per the deadline fixed by the RBI.\n \"The decision to extend the timeline for the full implementation of Basel 3 guidelines by a year is a credit negative for Indian public sector banks,\" Vadlamani said.\n It expects that all public sector banks would have a core equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of atleast 8 per cent by the end of March 2019, based on the government's commitment that it would capitalise all these banks to a level sufficient to meet the minimum regulatory capital norms.\n \"With the regulatory timelines now extended, it may be a case that at least some of the rated public sector banks' CET1 ratios over the next 12 months would be lower than what we currently expect,\" he said.\n On restructuring of stressed MSME loans, Moody's said the track record of such asset classification, when seen over the last few years in India, has shown that they have \"largely been unsuccessful in addressing the underlying stress\".\n On the contrary, keeping stressed loans in the standard category has led to an underestimation of the extent of underlying asset quality issues by bank managements, and consequently the severity of the actions that they need to take to address the issue, Vadlamani added.\n The RBI central board, headed by RBI governor Urjit Patel, comprises 18 directors, including 4 RBI deputy governors.\n It also has two government nominees - Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg and Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar - and 10 independent directors including S Gurumurthy and Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran.",

It&rsquo;s now gearing for another obstacle in the form of state elections.Political uncertainty is emerging as the key risk as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen facing a tough electoral battle in some major states ahead of the national vote in 2019. The rupee rose Tuesday, after the Reserve Bank of India agreed to form a panel to study a government demand for a part of its capital, ending a brawl that&rsquo;s dented investor confidence.&ldquo;Political jitters amid state elections will be the key headwind for further rupee appreciation, while the economic factors aside from inflation haven&rsquo;t been rupee friendly,&rdquo; said Prakash Sakpal, economist at ING Groep NV in Singapore.Tuesday marks a sixth day of gains for the rupee, putting it on course for the longest winning run in 13 months. The rally has also been helped by the recent decline in oil prices. The currency climbed as much as 0.5 percent to 71.2825 per dollar, its strongest level since Sept. 4.\n  \n\n\n\nThe optimism may prove to be short-lived, with Modi&rsquo;s Bharatiya Janata Party seen losing to the main opposition Congress in the state of Rajasthan, according to Bloomberg Quint. The two parties are neck and neck in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh -- both of which are currently ruled by the BJP.Ballot-counting is due on Dec. 11 and the results may well determine how Asia&rsquo;s worst-performing currency ends 2018.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: The government expects the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to announce more measures in the days ahead to address liquidity issues faced by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) if there&rsquo;s a need for this, said a person familiar with the matter.The robust discussion on various issues at Monday&rsquo;s RBI central board meeting was seen as settling the debate on the central bank&rsquo;s autonomy and clearly establishing the government as a stakeholder in policy making. &ldquo;The Centre feels that liquidity is the main issue and autonomy is the bogey. RBI seems to have climbed down a bit from its earlier position,&rdquo; said the person cited above. Another person familiar with the deliberations characterised the meeting as positive and forward looking.The meeting, according to the first person, remained largely cordial though deputy governor Viral Acharya expressed reservations on some of the key issues raised by the government&rsquo;s nominees.Industry Members Back GovtThe government&rsquo;s wish list included liquidity support to head off any credit freeze risk, a relaxation in capital requirements for lenders, easing the prompt corrective action (PCA) rules for weak banks and support for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The government found strong support from the industry members on the 18-member board, said this person.They backed the finance ministry on the need for liquidity and resolving the credit squeeze faced by some sectors. This support from industry members and other directors facilitated decisions on the issues raised, said the person. Debate on the governance structure of the RBI and the role of its central board will be taken up later, said the person. The government is expected to continue with its policy of engaging with the RBI on issues impacting the economy through the board.The government had sought a special liquidity window for NBFCs, arguing that credit disbursal to vital sectors such as real estate and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) had stalled as lenders tried to conserve capital in order to avoid the possibility of default. While the central bank may not open a liquidity tap, it could announce more measures if credit disbursal does not pick up, regarded as critical for growth and employment generation.&ldquo;They will consider more measures if need be,&rdquo; said the person, adding that the finance ministry will continue discussions on the issue.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: With headline inflation expected to remain benign in the second half of the current fiscal, a report Monday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to keep repo rate, or the rate at which it lends to the banks, unchanged in the rest of the fiscal. The consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation fell to a one-year low of 3.31 per cent in October 2018, from 3.7 per cent in September 2018 and 3.58 per cent in October 2017. The retail inflation number is the lowest since September 2017 when it had touched 3.28 per cent. \"Given the strong focus of the MPC (monetary policy committee) on the headline inflation print, which should remain benign for the rest of second half of FY19, we see limited scope for rate hikes in the rest of FY19,\" the Kotak Economic Research report said. It expects headline inflation to be in the range of 2.8-4.3 per cent. It can be noted that the apex bank had maintained a status quo in its October policy review after two consecutive rounds of rate hikes of 0.25 per cent each. The repo rate currently stands at 6.5 per cent. The report, however, said it remains watchful of the upside risks to inflation emanating from pass-through of minimum support prices (MSPs), adverse movement in crude oil prices, volatility in global financial markets, lagged impact of the rupee weakness on input prices, adverse implications from fiscal slippage and staggered impact of HRA increases by states and its second-round impact. \"However, the seemingly structurally benign food inflation along with softening growth should help in capping the upside pressures, thereby providing the RBI the comfort of staying on pause mode in the foreseeable future,\" it noted. CPI inflation eased to 3.31 per cent in October, primarily led by contraction of 0.9 per cent in food inflation amid sharp drop in prices of vegetables and pulses. On a sequential basis, food inflation contracted by 0.5 per cent month-on-month after contracting by 1.1 per cent in September. Prices of fruits, vegetables, pulses, sugar and eggs continued to fall on a monthly basis. Core inflation (including petrol and diesel) hardened to 6.1 per cent in October from 5.7 per cent in September due to increase in prices in segments such as household goods and services, health and personal care.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: India's retail inflation rate dropped sharply in October, giving the central bank leeway to allow easier lending policies, but plunging farm prices sent a stark warning to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the challenges he faces in rural areas in next year's general election. The rate, which includes food and energy prices, dropped in October to 3.31 per cent on a year-on-year basis, the slowest pace in 13 months and remains below the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) medium-term target of 4 per cent for a third straight month. The September inflation rate was a revised 3.70 per cent.  Inflation risks have ebbed after a fall in global crude oil prices by about 20 per cent since early October to around $71 a barrel. The rupee has also stabilised after a slide of more than 14 per cent in the first 10 months of this year, which has made it the worst performing Asian currency in 2018.  The RBI's monetary policy committee unexpectedly left the repo rate at 6.50 per cent last month when markets had expected a hike.  In October, the drop in consumer prices was mainly due to the fall in food prices, data released by the Statistics Ministry showed on Monday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the October retail inflation rate would ease to 3.67 per cent, with estimates ranging from 3.23 per cent to 5.20 per cent. A.Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd, said food inflation continues to be more benign than expected despite fears that some prices might spike as the government steps in to buy crops at higher prices. \"The Monetary Policy Committee will take comfort from headline and we expect a pause in December,\" he said in reference to the chances the RBI would raise rates before the end of the year. \"We still expect a hike in February but will reassess the same given recent inflation prints and fall in oil prices,\" added Prasanna.  Slower inflation in food prices, which make up nearly half of India's consumer price index (CPI), are helped by bumper crop supplies and sale of subsidised foodgrain to nearly two-thirds of India's population of 1.3 billion. That has, in turn, helped keep overall inflation in check.  Retail food prices fell 0.86 per cent in October from a year earlier, against a 0.51 per cent rise in September, as farm prices dropped despite the government's announcement of sharp increase in foodgrain procurement prices ahead of state elections in the next few weeks.  TEMPORARY RELIEF  Modi is in danger of losing support in the countryside. Farmers hit by falling farm prices and rising unemployment could undercut his efforts to woo young voters. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, came in at 6.1 per cent, up from 5.8 per cent in September, according to analysts. That is because of higher prices for consumer goods and services during the Diwali Hindu festival season. The RBI has projected a retail inflation rate of 4.8 per cent by June 2019, slightly lower than its August forecast of 5.0 per cent. It has raised its policy interest rate 50 basis points since June, and is widely expected to raise rates by at least 25 basis points more by March 2019. The next policy review is due on December 5. Separately, industrial output expanded at an annual 4.5 per cent pace in September, compared with 4.3 per cent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, and the upwardly revised 4.7 per cent for August.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Retail inflation for the month of October eased to 3.31 per cent, while industrial production for the month of September is at 4.5 per cent , two sets of Government data released separately on Monday revealed. The rate of industrial production growth slowed down to a three-month low of 4.3 per cent in August. Manufacturing sector output grew 4.6 per cent in August compared with near 7 per cent in July, but 3.8 per cent in August a year ago.Retail inflation had fallen to a ten-month low of 3.69 per cent before rising marginally to 3.77 per cent in September on the back of slightly higher food and fuel prices.The recent plunge in global crude oil prices augurs well for inflation which, at present, is within the RBI's comfort level of 4 per cent indicating that it could keep the interest rates steady in the next bimonthly review. The RBI maintained a status quo in its October policy review after raising interest rates by 25 bps both in June and August. The Reserve Bank of India had revised its inflation projection downwards to 3.9-4.5 per cent from 4.8 per cent for the second half of the current fiscal mainly on the back of unusually benign food prices which, it said, imparts a downward bias to the inflation trajectory in second half. The central bank, however, had revised its stance to 'calibrated tightening' from 'neutral' considering the upside risks that pose a threat to inflation outlook. The RBI had projected the retail inflation at 4.8 per cent for the first quarter of next fiscal. The upside risks flagged by the central bank in its review include uncertainty in global crude oil prices, a volatile financial market and higher state-mandated prices for crops sown in summer. The expectations of rate hike by US Federal Reserve amid a strengthening dollar and a further weakening of the rupee could add to India's inflation worries.",

            "articleBody": " Mumbai: The rupee weakened by 26 paise to 72.76 against the US dollar Monday, owing to increased demand for the American currency from importers amid increasing global crude oil prices. The international benchmark, Brent crude again breached the $71 a barrel mark by surging 1.21 per cent.  Forex traders said besides increased demand of the US currency from importers, the dollar's strength against some currencies overseas weighed on the rupee but a higher opening of the domestic equity markets, capped the losses.  At the Interbank forex market, the rupee opened lower at 72.74 and slipped further to quote at 72.76 against US dollar, down 26 paise over its previous close.  On Friday, the rupee rose by 50 paise to end at 72.50 per US dollar Friday on increased selling of the greenback by exporters amid softening crude oil prices, which slipped below the $70 per barrel mark.  Meanwhile, on net basis, foreign funds bought shares worth Rs 614.14 crore, while DIIs sold share to the tune of Rs 337.28 crore Friday, provisional data showed.  The benchmark BSE Sensex rose 99.26 points, or 0.25 per cent to 35,257.81. SUN DRR",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: On the second anniversary of demonetisation, finance minister Arun Jaitley clarified that the real purpose of demonetisation was not the confiscation of cash but to bring it to the formal economy and make the holders pay tax. \"Confiscation of currency was not an objective of demonetisation. Getting it into the formal economy and making the holders pay tax was the broader objective. The system required to be shaken in order to make India move from cash to digital transactions,\" Jaitley said.In a blog post, Jaitley, while listing the number of reforms taken by the BJP-led NDA government to fight the black economy, said that demonetisation resulted in increasing the tax base and a higher tax collection (both direct and indirect) for the government, thereby improving its fiscal health.\"The impact of demonetisation has been felt on collection of personal income tax. Its collections were higher in Financial Year 2018-19 (till 31-10-2018) compared to the previous year by 20.2%. Even in the corporate tax the collections are 19.5% higher. From two years prior to demonetisation, direct tax collections have increased 6.6% and 9% respectively. In the next two years, post demonetisation the increase by 14.6% (part of the year before impact of demonetisation in 2016-17) and an increase of 18% in the year 2017-18,\" Jaitley wrote.The impact on government's digital transaction initiative UPI was noticeable as it saw a siginificant jump post demonetisation with transactions growing from Rs 0.5 billion in October, 2016 to Rs 598 billion in September, 2018. The value of BHIM transactions also went up siginificantly post demonetisation, thereby giving a fillip to government's efforts to expand the digital payment space.\"The Unified Payment Interface (UPI) was launched in 2016 involving real time payments between two sets of mobile holders. Its transactions have grown from Rs. 0.5 billion in October, 2016 to Rs. 598 billion in September, 2018,\" Jaitley said. \"It (BHIM) is currently used by 1.25 Crore people. The value of BHIM transactions has gone up from Rs. 0.02 billion in September, 2016 to Rs. 70.6 billion in September, 2018. The share of BHIM transactions in overall UPI transactions is at about 48% in June, 2017,\" he added.Jaitley said that large deposits of cash in the banks improved their lending capacity and a lot of this amount was diverted to mutual funds for further investments.\"Larger deposits in banks improved lending capacity for the banks. A lot of this money was diverted to the Mutual Funds for further investments. It became a part of the formal system,\" he wrote.",

            "articleBody": " CHENNAI: Unemployment rate in the country rose to 6.9% in October, the highest in two years, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Worse still, the labour participation rate &ndash; a measure of the proportion of adults willing to work &ndash; fell to 42.4%, the lowest since January 2016, CMIE said.&ldquo;Labour participation rate fell sharply after demonetization&rdquo;, from around 47-48%, &ldquo;and it has still not recovered,&rdquo; the CMIE study said.&ldquo;The small improvement in labour statistics seen in September turned out to be short-lived. October statistics point to a continuation of the deterioration in labour markets seen earlier,&rdquo; the think-tank said.The estimated number of persons employed during October 2018 at 397 million was 2.4% lower than the 407 million persons employed in October 2017. &ldquo;This sharp fall in the employment rate in October is perhaps the most worrisome measure of the labour markets.&rdquo; CMIE said in its bulletin.The count of the unemployed persons actively looking for jobs almost doubled to 29.5 million in October 2018 from a low of 14 million in July 2017 (and 21.6 millon in Ocotber 2017), CMIE said.Commenting on CMIE's latest unemployment data, Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, CIEL HR Services, said, \"October-to-December is traditionally the job creation period across sectors in the Indian economy, and the mismatch between demand and supply of labour is hence worrying.\" Annually, almost 12 million people enter the country's labour markets and job creation hasn&rsquo;t been robust enough to support this, he said.He added the subdued performance of the country's core sectors such as power and infrastructure, coupled with inadequate lending by NBFCs could be a reason for the mismatch. \"The IT industry has also not created much jobs in this period,\" he said.

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Indian economy will expand 7.4 per cent in 2018, but the growth will slow down to 7.3 per cent in the next year as domestic demand tapers on higher borrowing cost due to rising interest rates, Moody's Investors Service said Thursday.In its report titled &lsquo;Global Macro Outlook 2019-20', Moody's said the economy grew 7.9 per cent in the first half (January-June) of 2018, which reflects post demonetisation base effect.Stating that borrowing costs have already increased on higher interest rates, Moody's said it expects the Reserve Bank will continue to steadily raise the benchmark rate through 2019, which will further dampen domestic demand.&ldquo;These factors will limit the pace of the Indian economy's growth over the next few years, with real GDP growth of 7.3 per cent in 2019 and 2020, from around 7.4 per cent in 2018,&rdquo; Moody's said.It said the greatest downside risk to India's growth prospects stem from concerns about its financial sector.&ldquo;The impact of higher global oil prices compounded by sharp rupee depreciation raises the cost of households' consumption basket, and will weigh on households' capacity for other expenditures. Borrowing costs have already risen because of tightening monetary policy,&rdquo; it said.Moody's said, in the short term while measures to stabilise the financial sector are put in place, credit growth is likely to slow.&ldquo;Downside risks from a prolonged liquidity squeeze for non-bank financial institutions, which could lead to a sharper slowdown in their credit provision, remain,&rdquo; it added.Moody's said global economic growth will slow in 2019 and 2020 to a little under 2.9 per cent from an estimated 3.3 per cent in 2018 and 2017.The US-based agency expects trade and geopolitical frictions between the US and China to persist for some time.&ldquo;This will weigh on the global trade growth and will reshape trade flows and supply chains,&rdquo; Moody's added.",

            "articleBody": " BEIJING: India on Tuesday voiced its concern to China over the large trade deficit with it which has climbed to over $51 billion, and underlined the need to boost bilateral trade in IT services, agriculture products, pharmaceuticals and tourism sectors in which it has proven strength and global presence but miniscule presence here.The bilateral trade between India and China rose by 18.63 per cent year-on-year and reached a historic high of $84.44 billion last year. But the trade deficit too continue to remain high at $51.75 billion in 2017.Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan, who is visiting Shanghai to attend the China International Import Expo (CIIE) here, met Wang Shouwen Vice Minister of China's Commerce Minister and discussed bilateral trade issues.He also expressed satisfaction over the progress made in talks regarding the export of soya bean meal and pomegranate from India, according to an Indian Embassy release here.\"The Commerce Secretary while expressing concern regarding the large trade deficit, acknowledged Chinese government's efforts in clearing some of the market access issues such as for rice, rapeseed meal etc. during the past few months and expressed satisfaction over progress on soya bean meal and pomegranate and related issues,\" the statement said.India has been airing its concerns to China over the huge trade deficit for several years.New Delhi has been putting pressure on Beijing to take measures to bring down the over $51.75 billion trade deficit, which was one of the main focus areas of the informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan in April this year.India has been asking China to provide market access to its food and agro products, pharmaceuticals, IT and IT-enabled services (ITES), tourism and services in which it has proven strengths and significant global presence but minuscule presence in China.The Indian pavilion at the CIIE has showcased import opportunities of these products.In his meeting with Wang, Wadhawan also informed him about the encouraging response to the business promotion events organised by the Indian Embassy and Consulates covering products like sugar, rice, tea, oil meals etc.He requested Wang to provide the guidelines of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce to its importers to source these products from India.Recently, India and China had a series of official level exchanges to discuss the bilateral trade issues.After the successful Joint Economic Group meeting hosted by India's Commerce Minister in March 2018 and attended by Chinese Commerce Minister, both countries had two rounds of dialogues at the official level leading to resolution of some of the pending market access issues, the release said.Wadhawan also had a discussion with sugar importers of China, including China Sugar Association, and briefed them about India's sugar sector and its proven available capacity in terms of both, quality as well as quantity, to meet the Chinese requirements on a sustained long term basis.Important players from Indian sugar industry including Managing Director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited (NFCSF) also attended the meetings.These meeting would be helpful in tapping this major import market for Indian sugar, it said.",

            "articleBody": " The role of the RBI board is to be the wise counsel, to play a Rahul Dravid, not to make operational decisions and certainly not be loud like Navjot Sidhu, Raghuram Rajan, former governor, RBI tells Supriya Shrinate of ET Now. Edited excerpts:There is a big clamour on whether PCA norms for the 11 banks be relaxed to allow more lending to the MSME sector. Do you believe we can do this at this point in time? We are in the middle of the NPA cleanout and yet there are MSMEs that are fund starved. Can we afford to take that risk? Let me not go into the direct details of the PCA norms. What I find problematic is sometimes arguments go this way &ldquo;oh! Basel says this, why don&rsquo;t you go down the Basel level?&rdquo; While it is true that on some issues Basel may be a little more flexible than the Indian situation, but there are many other places where the Indian situation is much more flexible than Basel. Ultimately if we go strictly by Basel, we will get accused of being in the thrall of foreign hands and so on. You are listening only to foreigners. On the other hand if we do something based on the Indian situation, you are accused of not following Basel, especially, when it is tighter than Basel. I do not think this is a really serious debate. What you have to ask is what are the Indian conditions that require a certain level of precaution? RBI is a professional institution and should be trusted if it can explain why that level is needed. By all means, ask for an explanation, but then let them use their professional judgement. Now on the MSMEs, go to any country in the world, find an MSME which says it is not starved for funds. The reality is MSMEs are hard to lend to which is why they are always clamouring for more funds. The right way to get more funds to them is to improve the formalisation, the kind of business environment they operate in. Which is why I think if the improvement in doing business ratings that we have seen in the recent past is real, then that in fact is a good way to help the MSMEs. But simply opening the tap wider for them or saying less provisioning on this, runs the risk of creating loans that then come back to roost as higher NPAs. We have to do a proper assessment of the loans we have already made. What has been the experience with the Mudra Scheme? What has been the experience with other MSME lending? My worry is that NPAs there are far bigger than we think especially because there is a constant clamour to say do not declare it an NPA. That suggests that we should be more rather than less worried. The government is right in going on a move to expand the possibilities of MSMEs. The right way to do that is to improve the business environment and the credit process, but not to relax credit standards. That, is an important distinction, which we should keep in mind.CIC has issued a show-cause notice to the RBI to reveal names of defaulters that you had put in a list in February 2015 to the PMO. RBI has asserted it cannot disclose that,  I am quoting from their response, &ldquo;because large value cases of frauds are under various stages of investigation and minutes of action taken report contain confidential information about third parties and this could impede the process of investigation.&rdquo; After giving those names, are you satisfied with the action taken in a whole host of cases?These are two separate issues. One is the issue of fraud which is not necessarily the same as wilful defaulter. A wilful defaulter is somebody who does not want to pay but who has necessarily run away with the money. On the issue of frauds, the full force of the law should be employed to bring these frauds to book and to essentially show that the Indian law enforcement structure is capable of doing that. That certainly is a work in progress.Separately there is the issue of a number of business people who the banks believe are not paying them when they have the ability to pay and eventually through a quasi judicial process declare them wilful defaulters. I am not well versed enough in the law to understand why those names cannot be made public after they have been through a judicial process. But this is something that belongs the legal realm rather than something I have expertise in.Do you believe there is enough political will in India to crack down on billionaire defaulters?I do not know. I will go by the noises that are made and it certainly seems to be that there is an intent to bring these people to book but I do think that from the longer term perspective if fraud goes unpunished, it simply encourages more fraud. It would be good if there is a sense that there is no place on earth where you can hide because the long arm of the Indian law will come after you. That will send a very sound message because you would not be able to enjoy wealth even if you make a way. This message needs to be sent if we have to protect our banking system. Ultimately you cannot prevent fraud. but you can ensure that it does not pay.One of the big bones of contention between the government on one hand and the RBI on the other, has been supervision of public sector banks. What has been your own experience as India&rsquo;s central banker? Is it restricted because the counter argument is that you have got enough and more supervision on the private sector banks and look at what is happening there?  You can always enter into an endless debate about this process. Let me just say that there is room for improvement on all sides on the governance of banks, both in the private sector as well as in the public sector; both in the role the government plays as well as the role the RBI plays. We have to recognise that the level of NPAs in both the public sector as well as the private sector is not by any means a level to be proud of. We have to all examine what went wrong and do what is necessary to put the banking system on a healthy turf because going forward, the amount of lending we need to get to that 9-10% growth that we must have in order to employ all the people that are coming into the labour force, we need a healthy banking sector. Every side has to contribute and there is really not much value pointing figures at each other, there is plenty of work for everyone to do.What does this public showdown really mean for markets as well as the currency? There are rumours floating around about the possibilities of India&rsquo;s central banker quitting. What does this mean for sentiment at large? I would rather hope that people take the right lesson from what has happened so far and back off from the cliff edge. Both sides have to listen to each other but there has to also be a respect of each one&rsquo;s turf. What to my mind is most worrisome is the change in the role played by the RBI&rsquo;s board in all this. The RBI&rsquo;s board is not an operational board. It is not led by professional supervisors or central bankers. These are all people from different walks in life whose main role is to play the wise people to advice, to council, to play a Rahul Dravid, to coach in some sense but not to make operational decisions and certainly not be loud like Navjot Sidhu. This is really what I am very worried about is the change in tenure. They are supposed to be the wise people who bridge differences rather than force greater ones. We have had excellent people on those boards. There are still very good people on those boards and I would hope that they would come together to bridge these differences and reduce some of the noise that is coming. I do not think India should have a breakdown in dialogue between the central bank and the government. I do not think it needs to happen. I do not think if wiser minds prevail it will happen.  I know you would not take names but the presence of certain people on the RBI board seems to be widening this divide between the government and the RBI. Does selection of board become more important and do people like S Gurumurthy need to be kept out of those boards? I do not want to comment on specific personalities but really the government appoints people on the board primarily to ensure that the governance of the institution is in the direction that the country desires, to check that they are not paying themselves inordinate salaries but also to give them a guidance about what different people from different walks in life think.We had Ela Bhatt on it. We had professor Kakodkar . All very wise people who gave us direction and we listen to them. I think that is the role of the board rather than to intervene in operational decisions and to substitute their judgment for the judgement of the professionals who actually manage the RBI. We need to do this separation because clearly in the recent past we are transcending what should be the appropriate role of the board and I hope that there is a dialogue between all the parties concerned to reset what in fact should be happening. Where do you see the RBI-government faceoff going? Let is back off a little from the current controversy and just think a little bit about what really is the relationship between the central bank and the government. Dr Viral Acharya gave the analogy of T20 and a test match. But a good analogy is central bank is a seatbelt for the government which is the driver. The driver can decide whether to put on the seatbelt or not. The driver may not put on the seatbelt but the seatbelt is useful in times of a crash. Now think of the central bank as thinking about that crash and saying I want to protect financial stability because I do not want that to be a terrible event and of course the driver is thinking about the process of normal driving and says well I want to be relatively free of constraint. But when they talk to each other, they realise there is some value to putting on that seatbelt because it prevents the really unfortunate eventuality, and if you want to extend the analogy further, one can think of Dr Acharya&rsquo;s speech is basically being that warning which comes on when you do not put on your seatbelt. It is saying put on your seatbelt, put on your seatbelt and hopefully eventually that warning is adhered too. Now, the historic relationship between the government and the RBI has been based on the fact that the government naturally and correctly thinks about pushing growth and for that it wants maximum freedom to be given to all the entities who are responsible for growth. While the RBI focuses on financial stability and says here is the amount of growth I can allow without impinging on financial stability. They work with each other on that basis. The government always pushes. There were enumerable letters on my table coming from the government saying relax this, relax that, relax something else and they knew that we would look at the letter carefully, take a view but that view would be saying how can we maximise growth while protecting financial stability and then when we said no, they would go away and say okay, fine. They would think about it and two days later, another letter would come on some other issue and they would keep trying to press the boundary. Ultimately, financial stability is RBI&rsquo;s responsibility and if we failed on it, we would be held to task. Given that responsibility we had the authority to say no and let me remind you of that quote in Dr Subbarao&rsquo;s book where he talked about the relationship between Dr Reddy and Mr Chidambaram based on a phone call where on Dr Reddy&rsquo;s side he was hearing and said no, no, no and yes eventually. When Dr Subbarao asked what were you saying no to? He said he asked me to relax this and relax that and I kept saying no. Ultimately he asked can you hear and I said yes and that is how the call ended. But the anecdote is really about the relationship between the Reserve Bank and the government. The government appoints the governor, appoints the deputies but ultimately goes by the views knowing these are professionals, they are not doing it for political reasons or for their own self interest. They are doing it because they have taken a view on the ultimate stability of the country.I am tempted to ask you if the Governor and finance minister can ever be friends because one is a technocrat, the other is a politician. The RBI governor is supposed to be a technocrat but the finance ministers are hardnosed politicians with very different objectives. Are these two men or women from Mars and Venus where the two are going to disagree because they have got two different objectives? and it is going to be elusive for us to try and bring them together? No, it is possible to disagree but still be respectful of each other&rsquo;s territory and I think certainly in my relationships there were many disagreements but I hope there was an understanding that this was not because of bloody mindedness but because there was a worry and they knew when the RBI said yes, it meant we were taking responsibility for the financial stability consequences and we always try to maximise the potential for growth while keeping that financial stability concern. And this is what is there sometimes in the commentary out in the press. People do not understand. Of course, the RBI is essentially an agency of the government and of course it has to respect the overall concern and objectives of the government but the government has entrusted it with the responsibility for financial stability and therefore it has to as a good responsible entity carry out that responsibility.As I said, sometimes the seatbelt constraints but that seatbelt constraints because you put it on and you put it on knowing that it will prevent you from an accident.While your table was laden with letters from the government, we are now hearing Section 9 being invoked. Under what circumstances do you believe invoking Section9 is justified? Let me put it this way. First, Section 7 has not been invoked. That is the good news and I do believe that when the relation gets precarious, it has to be invoked. We have to be very worried. That said, the dialogue between the Reserve Bank and the government is always an ongoing one. There are always sort of points of view being expressed. Sometimes there are sort of disagreements but ultimately it works based on respect. You have to know why the other guy is doing what he is doing and ultimately at the end of the day you have to part maybe not as friends but as respectful of each other territory. It is when you encroach on each other territory that it become problematic and I would hope that that respect get established. One of the substantive issues of disagreement is liquidity infusion in the markets. The government is very insistent that this must be done to bail out the NBFCs that are facing a cash crunch.  RBI believes there is enough liquidity in the system and that is really a judgement call for the central bank to make. But is this really a cry for more funds or are more funds required to avert a bailout of many more NBFCs like IL&amp;FS? I do not want to get into the specifics of the case because there is more information than I have on the specific frailties of NBFCs. But generally, in a situation where there is financial stress, the central bank has to figure out whether it is ultimately a liquidity problem that is infusing liquidity into the market will resolve some of those issues or is it a solvency problem that is some of these entities have taken on really bad assets and really they are decapitalised. The reality is if it is a solvency problem, that does not mean that the government and Reserve Bank should not intervene but it really involves the physical use of funds and therefore the government has to be directing that and putting the taxpayers&rsquo; money at risk. Now that is a big political issue because you are using taxpayer money to bail out a private entity and people will ask these people who made money over so many years why is it that you are bailing them out? That was a big issue in the United States when the bail out took place. If it is primarily solvency, you can address that by infusing liquidity into the market through more OMOs and if the problem is you need liquidity directed to certain places, perhaps lend to certain entities who can make those loans. The recent move to allow banks to guarantee bonds by these entities is a good one. Any kind of intervention should come after the entities that are in difficulty have taken their own steps to bolster their balance sheets. If your view is your commercial paper is coming six months from now and therefore you are worried about rollover, should you not be raising equity now even if prices are depressed in order to back your balance sheet? That would be a good signal that in fact it is not directly running to the government and the central bank to bail yourself out that you are willing to take all the steps and it is only when all the markets are frozen that you go at which the government has to decide is it liquidity or solvency. If it is a solvency, it may require wiping out the equity of these entities and taking them over as for example I think IL&amp;FS has been done.",

China, the top global exporter, plans to become a major importer.China's imported goods and services are estimated to exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion respectively in the next 15 years, Xi said in his inaugural address, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\"India has built a pavilion at the expo highlighting its focus areas of agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, information technology and tourism,\" Prashant Lokhande, Counsellor Economic and Commerce of the Indian Embassy here said.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was among leaders of the countries who took part in the inaugural function of the Expo.Xi said measures announced in April to relax access to Chinese market have so far been implemented.China has further simplified negative list of foreign investments, reduced investment limits and lifted the level of free investment.China is taking solid steps to expand financial opening-up, continue to advance opening-up in the service sector, deepen opening-up in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and accelerate the opening-up process of sectors including telecommunications, education, medical treatment and culture, Xi said.He said there was every reason to be fully confident in the future of the Chinese economy, which in recent years has slowed down.At present, China's economy remains generally stable and is making good progress, Xi said, citing data including the GDP growth of 6.7 per cent in the first three quarters of 2018.\"China's economy is truly performing well within the reasonable range, giving us a solid foundation for delivering the development goals for the whole year,\" Xi said.Compared with other major economies, China still ranks among the world's top in terms of GDP growth, he said.The fundamentals for sound and stable economic growth remain unchanged, the necessary production factors for high-quality development remain unchanged, and the overall momentum of long-term economic stability and progress also remains unchanged, Xi said.China's capacity of macroeconomic regulation is growing, and efforts to deepen reform across the board have unleashed new drivers of growth, he added.With the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) being further implemented, two-way investment and trade between China and countries along the Belt and Road have continued to gather pace, Xi said.\"All in all, the favourable conditions are in place for the long-term, healthy and steady growth of the Chinese economy,\" Xi said.This is China's first international import expo. All major countries in the world including the US have massive trade deficits with China which is the leading exporter of the world.US President Donald Trump launched trade war with China in June by slapping additional tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.Trump has been insisting that China should cut down $375 billion trade deficit by providing more access to the American goods by ensuring IPR protection.India too has been pressuring China to take measures to bring down over $51 billion annual trade deficit, which was one of the main focus areas in the informal meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan in April this year.Since then, officials of the two countries held several rounds of talks for India to export its agricultural products like sugar and rice as well as its pharmaceuticals and IT in which the country has an upper hand in the global exports.Though the expo, which would be held till November 10, has evoked much interest in global industry, China is yet to liberalise its import market, officials said.It is the world's first import-themed national-level expo, covering an area of about 30,000 square metres, and will feature enterprise and business exhibitions, country pavilions for trade and investment.Twelve countries - Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Vietnam and the UK - will be the \"Guest of Honour\" at the mega business event.More than 3,000 companies from over 130 countries have confirmed participation in the enterprise and business exhibitions at the expo, with a total booth area of 270,000 square metres, state-run China Daily reported.

KOLKATA: A big jump in India&rsquo;s ranking in the World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business Index to 77 from 100 resulting from a marked improvement in key port infrastructure helping the external trade would go a long way in improving the country&rsquo;s image in the global market, engineering exporters&rsquo; apex body, EEPC India said on Monday.EEPC India Chairman Ravi Sehgal said that while it is a matter of great satisfaction for not just India's 23 places jump in the rankings, but also on the specific parameter of  Trading Across Borders. &ldquo;Our ranking has jumped by 66 places from 146 to 80. That is a big positive for our external trade and would help us in reducing costs on various counts, including the compliance costs at the ports and airports,&rdquo; he added.The World Bank report, on the Trading Across Borders category, said: &ldquo;India reduced import border compliance time in Mumbai by improving infrastructure at the Nhava Sheva Port. Export and import border compliance cost were also reduced in both Delhi and Mumbai by eliminating merchant overtime fees and through the increased use of electronic and mobile platforms.&rsquo;&rsquo;EEPC India said that the country's engineering exports, along with the rest of the export basket, may have declined in September, 2018, due to higher base effect, the focus on cutting compliance cost for trading across borders should help exporters catch up in the subsequent months of current fiscal and the next financial year.It said that there have been upgradation of the port infrastructure including streamlining of the procedures, digitization of documents; resulting in handling time for cargo. Under the Border Compliance Criterion the cost to export has come down from $382.4 to $251.6. Similarly, the cost to import has come down from $543.2 to $331. Over 92 per cent of India&rsquo;s export &ndash;import trade volume is carried out by sea and handled at ports.The renewed focus on the small and medium enterprises and helping them by way of interest subvention, as announced by the Prime Minister, would improve the competitiveness of Indian exporters.

            "articleBody": "\n\nNew Delhi: The country's services sector in October expanded at the quickest pace since July, driven by significant increase in new business orders, which in turn led to robust workforce expansion, a monthly survey said Monday.The seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index rose to 52.2 in October, from 50.9 in September.The services PMI was in the expansion territory for the fifth straight month. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.According to panellists, improved order flows supported the pick-up in output amid favourable market conditions, greater client bases and fruitful advertising.On the job front, Indian service providers continued to add to their payrolls and the sector witnessed the second-strongest increase in employment since March 2011.Meanwhile, the Nikkei India Composite PMI Output Index, that maps both the manufacturing as well as the services sector, improved from 51.6 in September to 53 in October; and highlighted the strongest expansion in private sector activity since July.&ldquo;The PMI surveys brought positive news of stronger economic growth at the start of the third quarter of FY 2018/19, together indicating a welcome rebound in private sector expansion from September's four-month low,\" said Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, and author of the report.On the prices front, cost-inflationary pressures eased, resulting in a softer increase in selling prices.\"Cost pressures faded in October, but service providers continued to report rising costs, especially for food and fuel,\" Lima said adding that a robust expansion in workforces added to firms' expenses.The survey further noted that though the business sentiment remained positive, it was hampered by political uncertainty.\"...firms are becoming more guarded in the face of growing uncertainties. The sustainability of current market conditions and political worries both weighed on optimism and posed downside risks to growth,\" Lima said.",

            "articleBody": "RBI Governor Urjit Patel (2nd L) with deputy governors arrive for a post-monetary policy press conference, in Mumbai New Delhi: The government has invoked never-before-used powers under the RBI Act allowing it to issue directions to the central bank governor on matters of public interest, in a development that gives a new twist to the ongoing skirmish between RBI and the government.ET has learnt that separate letters have been sent to the RBI governor in recent weeks &mdash; exercising powers under this section &mdash; on issues ranging from liquidity for NBFCs, capital requirement for weak banks and lending to SMEs.The unprecedented move could have triggered last week&rsquo;s rare public assertion of independence by RBI, with deputy governor Viral Acharya warning the Centre of disastrous consequences if the regulator&rsquo;s autonomy is impinged upon.Section 7 of the RBI Act empowers the government to consult and give instructions to the governor to act on certain issues that the government considers serious and in public interest.This Section had never been used in independent India till now. It was not used even when the country was close to default in the dark days of 1991, nor in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.&ldquo;The Central Government may from time to time give such directions to the Bank as it may, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, consider necessary in the public interest,&rdquo; says the Section. An RBI spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment.It is not yet clear how this Section operates since it has never been used till now.The aggressive move could scandalise a section of academia and experts, while raising questions about the government&rsquo;s intentions and the impact on Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s autonomy.Using the powers under Section 7 is considered sacrilegious among central bankers as it leaves little scope for the regulator to conduct the affairs in a way they deem fit. It would also set a precedent for future governments to push through their agenda even on minor issues, if there are differences.&ldquo;A government&rsquo;s horizon of decision-making is rendered short, like the duration of a T20 match (to use a cricketing analogy), by several considerations,&rdquo; Acharya had said last week.&ldquo;There are always upcoming elections of some sort &mdash; national, state, mid-term, etc. In contrast, a central bank plays a Test match, trying to win each session, but importantly also survive it so as to have a chance to win the next session, and so on.&rdquo;The government and RBI have been at loggerheads over a few issues for some time now. While the government believed that easing of lending rules for the 11banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework could help reduce pressure on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the regulator stood its ground arguing that such a move would put the clock back and undo clean-up efforts.With the credit markets tightening after the IL&amp;FS default in September, non-banking finance companies lobbied the government for more liquidity.But RBI maintained its position since the banking system did not witness any spike in borrowing costs and the market was just repricing risk in an evolving situation.A recent court order suggesting that the government consider giving directions to RBI under Section 7 of RBI Act in a case involving independent power producers may have opened up the avenue for the Centre. Power companies had contested a February 12 circular by the banking regulator that said if a borrower misses payment even for a day, it would be considered a defaulter even though the account will remain standard in the books of the bank.Acharya&rsquo;s speech last Friday was also unprecedented in its message, where he warned of economies getting punished for imprudence which the central banks are always against.&ldquo;As many parts of the world today await greater government respect for central bank independence, independent central bankers will remain undeterred,&rdquo; Acharya said. &ldquo;Governments that do not respect central bank independence will sooner or later incur the wrath of financial markets, ignite economic fire, and come to rue the day they undermined an important regulatory institution; their wiser counterparts who invest in central bank independence will enjoy lower costs of borrowing, the love of international investors, and longer life spans.&rdquo;",

We already have improved substantially. We will make the formal announcement tomorrow with the World Bank (releasing its report),\" Prabhu said here Tuesday.India jumped 30 places to rank 100th among 190 nations in the last year's World Bank's 'ease of doing business' index.The World bank ranks countries based on 10 parameters, including starting a business, construction permits, getting electricity, getting credit, paying taxes, trade across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency.According to sources, improvement is expected in parameters, including construction permit, starting a business, and trading across borders.Further talking about India-US trade relations, the commerce minister said that New Delhi is actively engaged with Washington to resolve the issues.He said that India would like to work with the US on global challenges to multi-lateral trading system and matters related to existential issues of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\"We have some trade issues with the US, but we can resolve them,\" he said, adding India-US strategic and commercial dialogue is expected in January, in which US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross may participate.He added that India is a growing economy and it offers huge advantages for the US companies.Citing a report, he said about 2,300 firms operating in China may be looking to shift their bases outside and \"we want to offer them a choice based on intrinsic advantages that India offers\".\"I have always been saying this that if you actually have a relationship with India, India can never pose a strategic challenge to the US,\" he said.Senior officials of India and the US are already in discussions to finalise a kind of trade deal. Both the sides holding two track discussions -- to increase trade in short and medium term, and identify long term trade potentials.India is pressing for exemption from high duty imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their generalised system of preferences (GSP), greater market access for its products from sectors such as agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.As many as 3,500 Indian products from different sectors like chemicals and engineering get duty-free access to the US market under the GSP, introduced in 1976.On the other hand, the US is demanding greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, including medical devices.India's exports to the US in 2017-18 stood at $47.9 billion, while imports were $26.7 billion. The trade balance is in favour of India.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Having missed the first three industrial revolutions, India is now in a position to lead the fourth on the back of its vast tech-savvy young population and is on the way to becoming one of the three richest countries in the world, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said Tuesday.Speaking at the 24th MobiCom conference here, Ambani, who heads the oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries, said India's digital transformation is \"unmatch and unprecedented\" after it took leadership position from being 155th in wireless broadband technology adoption in just 24 months.Back in the 1990s, when Reliance was building its oil refinery and petrochemical projects, India's gross domestic product (GDP) was around $350 billion and had just come out of a severe financial crisis.\"Very few in the world thought that our country's prospects were bright. Today our GDP is nearing $3 trillion, and India is well on its way to becoming one of the three richest countries in the world,\" he said.Ambani, the richest Indian, said mobile computing as a catalyst is driving massive data consumption &ndash; and this has given young Indians a fertile ground for disruptive ideas.Cloud computing and networking technologies have used broadband as a foundational enabler &ndash; leading to Indian entrepreneurs starting to make a global impact.\"In the next two decades, I can confidently say that India shall be leading the world and shall contribute to the next wave of global economic growth,\" he said.India languished on the fringes during the first two industrial revolutions powered by coal and steam and electricity and oil, respectively, and only started playing catch-up in the computer-driven third industrial revolution, he said.\"The fourth industrial revolution is now upon us. It is marked by a fusion of technologies straddling the physical, digital and biological worlds,\" he said. \"I can say with full confidence that India has a chance of not just participating in the fourth industrial revolution, but also leading it.\"This is possible because the India of today is remarkably different from the India of yesterday. \"India's vast tech-savvy young population is its key strength. Just imagine the kind of connected intelligence India can create if the power of billion-plus minds is combined!,\" he said.Also, being a democracy that is run on the model of equitable and inclusive growth, it is openly embracing the digital technologies of tomorrow. It is a rich and fertile ground for entrepreneurship and has emerged as the fastest growing start-up base worldwide, he said.\"Today, the nation is home to the third largest number of technology-driven start-ups in the world. Never before has India witnessed such an explosion of entrepreneurial spirit,\" he added.Ambani said India needs to prepare itself for a period of information and digital abundance, adapt itself to the scorching pace of innovation and learn to collaborate on scale, quickly transform the idea into a breakthrough innovation, shift from a system of time-bound education to a mode of continuous learning and create more employment opportunities than what new and disruptive technologies take away.\"We have to groom our children to be digitally-savvy right from school. Schools should train students in 'the four C-s' &ndash; critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. These are the skills required to build the foundation for a sustained leadership in the digital age for India.\"Within a single generation, we can empower and enrich our vast and young human resources to give India a competitive edge in the world,\" he said.Governments, businesses and civil society organisations should put together an ecosystem for massive upskilling of the workforce, he stated.\"We now have the opportunity to digitally reinvent all sectors of our economy &ndash; be it financial services, commerce, manufacturing, agriculture, education, and healthcare. India can leapfrog the competition and lead the world in each of these sectors,\" he said.Ambani said there was a pressing need to create a digital green revolution by encouraging adoption of technologies for water conservation, soil management, precision farming and waste reduction to enhance agricultural productivity.Secondly, there is a need for good quality education to make India's youth a productive asset, he said adding there is also a requirement to make healthcare affordable.Talking about Reliance Jio, his telecom venture that stormed the industry by combining free voice calls and SMS with cheap data, he said India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband.\"Jio is determined to move India to among the top 3 in fixed-line broadband, too,\" he said. \"Our state-of-the-art digital infrastructure provides mobile and broadband connectivity across the country, with the largest fibre footprint.\"This fibre connectivity will now be extended to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1500 cities to offer the most advanced fibre-based broadband connectivity solutions, he said.",

            "articleBody": " India is considering allowing some imports from China to be settled in yuan, people familiar with the proposal said, as the South Asian nation moves to limit its currency&rsquo;s loss against the dollar.The plan would enable direct convertibility between the rupee and yuan and will help cut transaction and hedging costs, the people said, asking not to be identified citing rules. The proposal would allow Indian exports of pharmaceuticals, oilseeds and sugar to China to be settled in rupee, while keeping out trade in high volume products such as electronics, they said.India-China trade is mainly settled in US dollars since currencies between the two nations aren&rsquo;t directly convertible. By allowing Indian importers to pay for Chinese goods in yuan, the South Asian nation would be able to save on dollars to pay for escalating oil import costs in the face of higher crude prices and the rupee&rsquo;s slump to a record low.Oil is India&rsquo;s biggest import item and the government estimates it will pay a record $125 billion, or 8.8 trillion rupees, for crude imports this fiscal year, the highest in rupee terms since 2001.Currency RisksA small but viable and ring-fenced basket of commodities is being considered for rupee-yuan trade, according to the person. Allowing direct convertibility can help cut currency risks for Indian traders, the person said.India&rsquo;s Commerce ministry spokeswoman didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to two phone calls to her mobile phone. China&rsquo;s Ministry of Commerce and the central bank didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to separates faxes seeking comments.Limiting the basket to a few items will help Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government keep India&rsquo;s $56 billion trade deficit with China in check. The current-account deficit is already at the highest level in five years, with the government raising tariffs on imports of items ranging from air-conditioners to communication gear in a bid to curb the shortfall and stabilize the rupee.\n  \n\n\n\nFor China, the move would help broaden the yuan&rsquo;s influence and improve liquidity overseas. The option of invoicing half of trade between the so-called BRICS nations -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- in yuan had already been discussed by the group.Bank of China Ltd. started a yuan clearing and settlement service in Pakistan in May, and similar yuan hubs have been set up in Russia and Canada to allow traders to settle transactions. A similar system could be considered in India, the people said.Earlier discussions about trading in local currencies had made little progress with Indian banks expressing apprehension about US regulations and with 80 percent of the nation&rsquo;s trade valued in dollars.China has been seeking to expand bilateral trade with India amid an intensifying trade conflict with the US However, Indian policy makers are worried manufacturers may not be able to cope if Chinese imports rise dramatically with the currency plan, the people said.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The Commerce Ministry is working on a comprehensive strategy and considering incentives for exporters with a view to boost the country's outbound shipments, a senior government official said on Friday.Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) Alok Chaturvedi said that the exports, which recorded about 10 per cent growth in 2017-18 to over $300 billion, is expected to reach $330-340 billion this fiscal.In the first half of the current fiscal, the exports grew by 12.5 per cent to $164 billion.He said the ministry has prepared a matrix of action plans for specific sectors, including engineering, gems and jewellery, chemicals, textiles and pharma, and issues pertaining to these areas are being taken up with the concerned departments.There are some cross-cutting issues such as withdrawal of amendment in the CGST rules, which is being partially resolved.\"We are thinking of having some kind of incentives, where exporters are at disadvantage with respect to our competing countries where they are having some kind of free trade agreement with common export markets.\"So, we are trying to finalise a scheme, you can provide incentive to partially compensate for that disadvantage, which our exporters are facing,\" the DGFT said here at CII's Export Summit.The ministry is also working on tax rebates, duties and embedded taxes, besides alternative payment mechanism in potential problem countries such as Venezuela, Sudan, Cuba and CIS nations.He said that it is the right of exporters to get rebate on those levies as \"those duties and taxes should not be exported. We are working on a pilot scheme\".Further, the DGFT said soon the IT system for exporters will be revamped completely and the ministry will float tenders for the same.Speaking at the summit, Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu asked the industry to become more aggressive in exploring export opportunities in new markets such as Africa and Latin America.He said the action plan prepared by the ministry to boost exports will be released soon.\"There are huge opportunities for exports in SAARC and ASEAN countries,\" Prabhu said, adding India is working with the US to resolve all the pending issues to boost bilateral trade.\"The US is raising issues related to data localisation, issues related to duty imposed by Indian on IT products. We are engaged with the discussion (with them),\" he added.Since 2011-12, India's exports have been hovering at around $300 billion. During 2017-18, the shipments grew by about 10 per cent to $303 billion.Promoting exports helps a country to create jobs, boost manufacturing and earn more foreign exchange. ",

            "articleBody": "Private surveys paint a bleak picture. India's jobless rate rose to 6.23 percent in March from 6.06 percent in February -- the highest monthly rate in the past 15 months, data from CMIE show. New Delhi: In what can be seen as confirming fears of a jobless growth in the country, Care Ratings Wednesday said employment growth in corporate India moderated to 3.8 per cent in FY18, from 4.2 per cent in FY17, with jobs in smaller companies being hit the hardest. The rating agency in its report said the moderation in employment growth is \"reflective of the proposition that higher economic growth is weakly translating into higher job creation\".It can be noted that many watchers, including the then Union labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya have questioned if we are facing a jobless growth, where the economic acceleration is not translating into growth in jobs.The report, based on an analysis of over 1,600 corporates, said smaller companies, with net sales of less than Rs 500 crore, have witnessed a contraction in employment growth, while larger companies, with over Rs 500 crore sales, had a positive employment growth in FY18.With a 14 per cent growth, the finance sector led the pack in job creation, followed by retail (13.05 per cent), construction (9.6 per cent), infrastructure (9 per cent) and ratings (8 per cent), according to the report.On the negative growth front, telecom topped the chart with a 7.6 per cent decline in job creation, followed by education and training registering a 5.3 per cent dip.In May 2017, Dattatreya conceded that the jobless growth is real and had also constituted a taskforce on it.\"The current growth is a jobless growth. Many European and Asian countries, including India, are facing it...growth is being reported but it is not reflecting in employment generation,\" he had said in May last year.From a cost perspective, the overall employee cost came at 8.3 per cent in FY18, while the average employee cost rose 4.3 per cent, according to the report.Just like growth in total permanent employees has seen a moderation in FY18 over FY17, both employee cost and average employee cost also witnessed a moderation in FY18 over FY17, it said.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: A research report by India's largest bank SBI on Wednesday said the rupee depreciation has neither helped in improving exports nor in slowing imports, leading to an incremental trade deficit of $4 billion in the first half of the current fiscal. Based on an analysis of both export and import intensive industries during April-September 2018, SBI's report 'Ecowrap' concluded that rupee depreciation has not helped exports as is widely believed.\n\"In effect, this means we are having a situation of declining exports and increasing imports. We estimate that the net incremental impact on trade deficit is $4 billion.\n\"Thus the common refrain that rupee depreciation will lead to export increase and import decline stands challenged,\" it said.\nIndia's exports entered the negative zone after five months, contracting 2.15 per cent in September to $27.95 billion due to dip in shipments in key sectors, including engineering and gems and jewellery, even though trade deficit narrowed to a five-month low.\nImports in September grew by 10.45 per cent to $41.9 billion, according to the commerce ministry data released Monday.\nThe report further said month wise External Commercial Borrowing data suggests, during March 2018 to August 2018, industries like petroleum, NBFCs, power, telecommunication and automobile are heavily borrowing through automatic route and aggregately contributing more than 71 per cent of total borrowing. \"So, any depreciation in rupee will have significant impact on their bottom line if the corporates have not adequately naturalised their risk through hedging,\" said Ecowrap.",

Much of the build-up relates to local government financing vehicles, which don&rsquo;t necessarily mean local governments themselves are on the hook for paying off the obligations.With the national economy slowing, and a Beijing-set quota for issuance of local-government bonds not being enough to fund infrastructure projects to support regional growth rates, authorities across the country have resorted to LGFVs to raise financing, according to S&amp;P. That&rsquo;s left LGFVs &ldquo;walking a tightrope&rdquo; between deleveraging and transforming their businesses into more typical state-owned enterprises, the S&amp;P analysts said.The continued focus on funding to sustain growth at the local level echoes a broader shift in the central government, which last year was focused on reducing leverage in the financial system. That phase is essentially over, thanks in part to an escalating trade war with the US, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts.&ldquo;The markets are right, in our view, to feel more concerned about the sustainability of China&rsquo;s debt and the increased financial risks,&rdquo; said Liu Li-Gang, chief China economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong. He also saw &ldquo;renewed pressure&rdquo; on the yuan.",

REUTERS/David Stobbe/File Photo New Delhi: Industrial production growth slipped to a three-month low of 4.3 per cent in August mainly due to a sharp decline in the mining sector output and poor offtake of capital goods, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) data.  The industrial production measured in terms of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) was 4.8 per cent in August last year, the CSO data released Friday showed.  The mining sector production contracted by 0.4 per cent in August compared to a growth of 9.3 per cent in the year-ago month. Similarly the capital goods output growth decelerated to 5 per cent during the month from a 7.3 per cent expansion year ago. \n The IIP growth is the lowest since May when industrial production grew at 3.9 per cent. Industrial production expanded by 6.8 per cent in June and 6.5 per cent in July. \n The manufacturing sector output grew at 4.6 per cent in August compared to 3.8 per cent a year ago. Power generation grew at the rate of 7.6 per cent in the month as against 8.3 per cent in the year-ago month.\n In terms of industries, 16 out of 23 industry groups in the manufacturing sector have shown positive growth during August 2018 as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year.  As per use-based classification, the growth rates in August 2018 over August 2017 are 2.6 per cent in primary goods, 2.4 per cent in intermediate goods and 7.8 percent in Infrastructure/ Construction Goods.  \n The consumer durables and consumer non-durables have recorded growth rates of 5.2 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively. \n According to data, the IIP growth in April-August was 5.2 per cent, up from 2.3 per cent in corresponding period in the previous fiscal.",

            "articleBody": "A man checks his phone outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai, India, April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas India&rsquo;s headline inflation data may be subdued for now, but there are mounting risks that are difficult to ignore: A record-low currency, high oil prices, and a looming election that&rsquo;s prompting the government to raise food prices to placate farmers.Data due Friday evening will probably show consumer prices rose 4 per cent in September, according to the median of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. That pace is faster than the previous month&rsquo;s, but bang on the target set by the Reserve Bank of India.Inflation within target and signs that demand may be cooling in the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing major economy prompted the central bank to keep interest rates on hold last week, and lower the forecast for gains in consumer prices. The RBI expects inflation in the range of 3.9 per cent to 4.5 per cent in the second half of the fiscal year to March 2019, down from 4.8 per cent projected earlier.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile headline inflation has eased in recent months, the core measure, which strips out volatile fuel, food and electricity prices, has been sticky at around 6 per cent.&ldquo;We expect core inflation to stay sticky at 5.87 per cent due to the steady build up of demand-pull price pressures,&rdquo; said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist with L&amp;T Finance Holdings Ltd. in Mumbai. &ldquo;Moreover, sustained spikes in Brent crude prices and massive rupee depreciation have clouded the outlook for inflation despite a favorable statistical base.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s reflected in the Monetary Policy Committee&rsquo;s change in policy stance to &ldquo;calibrated tightening&rdquo; from neutral, signaling it&rsquo;s not done with rate hikes yet. It said that while low food inflation provided comfort, surging oil and volatile financial markets could lead to higher price pressures.India, which imports more than 80 per cent of its oil needs, is vulnerable to increasing crude prices. Together with the rupee, Asia&rsquo;s worst-performing major currency this year, this worsens the outlook for inflation and the current-account gap. Besides, the government&rsquo;s move to raise support prices for farm produce will add to the inflationary pressures.According to the central bank, a 20 per cent increase in the price of the Indian basket of crude to $96 a barrel would dent growth by 30 basis points and stoke inflation by 40 basis points. The price of Brent crude, the benchmark for half the world&rsquo;s oil, is hovering above $80 per barrel as impending American sanctions squeeze Iranian exports and an economic crisis in Venezuela disrupts supplies.&ldquo;We do not think that the RBI&rsquo;s rate-hike cycle has come to an end,&rdquo; said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Financial Services Ltd. &ldquo;Yet, with the real policy rate at 250-300 basis points, headroom for the RBI to carry out rate hikes is limited unless inflation crosses 5 per cent consistently.&rdquo;",

Sentiment had got a lift after the State Bank of India (SBI), coming to the rescue of cash-strapped NBFCs, decided to buy their assets to the tune of Rs 45,000 crore, a move that will provide liquidity support to non-banking financing companies (NBFCs) facing headwinds after a series of loan defaults by IL&amp;FS group firms.",

            "articleBody": " BENGALURU: India's retail inflation likely sped up in September on higher food and fuel costs, pushed up by a battered rupee and suggesting further policy tightening from the Reserve Bank of India, a Reuters poll found. The Indian central bank last week held interest rates unchanged, surprising many market watchers who anticipated a third consecutive hike, but shifted its stance from \"neutral\" to \"calibrated tightening\" in a nod to pricing pressures. The median of 45 economists in the poll taken Oct. 3-9 showed inflation was expected to have accelerated to the central bank's medium-term target of 4.00 per cent last month from a year ago, higher than August's 10-month low of 3.69 per cent. Forecasts ranged from 3.60 per cent to 4.70 per cent, with over 40 per cent of economists expecting inflation to rise above the RBI's target, almost one third forecast it to fall below target and the remaining 11 said it would be bang on 4.00 per cent. \"Consumer price inflation is likely to have risen in September, in large part because the recent sharp fall in food inflation appears to have reversed,\" said Shilan Shah, a senior India economist at Capital Economics. \"Core inflation is likely to have remained elevated. Despite the RBI keeping rates on hold last week, the tightening cycle still has a little bit further to run.\" Although food inflation has quickened it was subdued enough to offset some of the pain coming from the double whammy of a weak currency and rising oil prices. The rupee tumbled to a new low of 74.395 against the US dollar on Tuesday and Brent crude, India's costliest import item, hit a four-year high this month. According to a separate Reuters poll, the struggling rupee, which has lost over 16 per cent against the greenback this year so far, was not expected to reverse its losses anytime soon. \"India's macro concern at the moment is not the rupee, but liquidity. If the RBI takes care of liquidity, then other concerns should gradually subside,\" said Shashank Mendiratta, economist at ANZ Bank. \"The RBI to that extent has taken steps to infuse liquidity by announcing OMOs (open market operations) and similar measure will be taken up through this fiscal year.\" Wholesale price inflation probably rose to 4.90 per cent in September from 4.53 per cent in August. The poll forecast industrial output expanded 4.0 per cent in August from a year ago compared with 6.6 per cent in July. That prediction was probably based on slower output growth from eight core industries - accounting for nearly 40 per cent of total industrial production - with annual production cooling to 4.2 per cent in August, from 7.3 per cent a month earlier.

            "articleBody": " BENGALURU: India's battered rupee is expected to stay that way for a while, trading near recent record lows over the coming year even as the Reserve Bank of India is forecast to raise rates in December and once more in 2019, Reuters polling found.  The rupee has hit repeated record lows against the dollar this year in its worst run since the financial crisis. It is down over 16 percent so far this year, tracking a deep selloff in emerging markets driven by a resurgent dollar and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. While just two weeks ago a majority of economists polled by Reuters predicted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would hike interest rates on Oct 5, the central bank surprised by keeping its policy unchanged and said it was not targeting any currency level. After that decision the rupee fell to a record low of 74.25 against the dollar. On Tuesday, the partially-convertible Indian currency hit a fresh low of 74.395 per dollar. \"We believe the RBI is underestimating the inflationary pressure in the Indian economy and the impact of ongoing Fed tightening,\" said Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank, referring to a series of U.S. Federal Reserve rate rises expected in the coming year. Inflation in India was forecast to be a touch above the central bank's comfort level of around 4 percent in the third quarter and the current one.  But India's widening current account deficit, thanks to rising oil prices and a weak rupee, combined with below-normal rainfall this year could translate into rising price pressures over the near term. While economists were evenly split on the question of whether a rate hike was required to stop the rupee from falling further, the RBI is still expected to deliver in December. It is also forecast to follow that hike in the third quarter of next year, taking the repo rate to 7 percent. That suggests economists have pushed their expectations for the rate hike they had previously pencilled in for October to the next meeting, the last one scheduled for this year. \"Even as most (on the Monetary Policy Committee) voted to change the stance to 'calibrated tightening,' there was an evident lack of action on their part despite time running out to stop the rupee's worst fall in last five years,\" noted Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING. Still, 26 of 47 economists who answered an additional question said the RBI was right to keep policy on hold this month. Predictions for one aggressive 50 basis point rate hike by end-2018 dropped sharply in the latest survey, with only one respondent now expecting such a move compared to 17 in the previous poll on September 25. \"We continue to look for the USDINR to head towards 75.0, factoring in our view of at least four rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve over the year, which will be dollar and rates positive,\" noted Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Group Research. The latest Reuters poll of over 50 currency strategists taken Oct. 5-9 showed the rupee was seen trading around the current rate, about 74 per dollar, in three months and strengthening just a bit to around 73 per dollar in a year. The weakest forecast across was 78.0 while the strongest rupee outlook was 67.97 compared to 75.6 and 66.1, respectively, in the previous month poll. But in a year, the rupee's expected performance is broadly in line with expectations for most currencies as the dollar's resurgence is predicted to fade.  A majority, 27 of 48 analysts, said the risks were skewed more towards the rupee strengthening against the greenback over the next year.",

            "articleBody": "Candidates enroll for job interviews during a job fair, in Jabalpur on Monday, June 11, 2018.Photo) NEW DELHI: In India, the world&rsquo;s fastest-expanding economy, the link between growth and job creation is weakening.New research from the privately-run Azim Premji University shows that a growth rate of 7 per cent is now leading to less than 1 per cent improvement in employment, while in the 1970s and &rsquo;80s an expansion of 3 per cent to 4 per cent was resulting in a much higher 2 per cent gain in jobs. The outcome is an unemployment rate that&rsquo;s hit 5 per cent in 2015, the highest in at least 20 years.The main reason for the worsening correlation between growth and jobs was a mismatch between skills and &ldquo;good jobs,&rdquo; according to researchers led by Amit Basole. The share of the so-called goods jobs that broadly includes formal employment with regular pay accounted for only 17 per cent of the country&rsquo;s 467 million workforce.&ldquo;Simply put, higher growth has raised aspirations but has failed to generate the kind of jobs that will allow people to fulfill those aspirations,&rdquo; the researchers wrote in the report, called State of Working India 2018. &ldquo;This obviously points to the issue being not only one of job creation, but of the creation of decent and desirable jobs.&rdquo;Growth has averaged 7 per cent since reforms began in 1991 under Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy. The most recent figures show gross domestic product expanded 8.2 per cent in the three months through June from a year earlier, making India the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing major economy.India is on track to hold that position, with the International Monetary Fund retaining its growth forecast of 7.3 per cent for the fiscal year through March 2019.Still, unemployment remains high, especially among young and educated Indians. More than one-third of about 23 million people who were actively searching for jobs have graduate or higher levels of education, the study found.Failure to create opportunities for the young workforce will not only hurt Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s re-election bid next year, but impede the economy&rsquo;s current pace of expansion.&ldquo;India&rsquo;s employment situation and the state of its labor statistics are both subjects of national news. The performance of the present government on job creation is also expected to be a key issue in the upcoming general elections in 2019,&rdquo; the researchers said.Other highlights of the report:* Of India&rsquo;s 467 million workforce as of 2015, 46.6 per cent were self-employed, 32.8 per cent were casual workers, 17 per cent were regular salaried workers and the rest had contractual employment * Jobs growth in manufacturing largely in form of contract workers* Among those classified as regular workers, only 10 per cent had jobs with benefits and a written contract in manufacturing sector, 28 per cent in services and 1 per cent in construction* Wage levels have remained low and have grown slowly over the last three decades, especially compared to the rates of GDP growth* Productivity and managers&rsquo; pay rising faster than workers&rsquo; wages* Unemployment in youth and higher educated reached 16 per cent",

Traders said there was also some importer demand seen in afternoon trade, but intermittent dollar selling by the central bank is likely to prevent a steep fall in the unit. Sentiment has also been weaker after the central bank held rates steady in a surprise move on Friday and pushed the rupee to its previous record low  of 74.23. The partially convertible rupee was trading at 74.24/25 per dollar at 0751 GMT, after hitting 74.28 earlier and weaker than its previous close of 74.0750.",

Addressing a rally in Dholpur's Mania area, Gandhi said the prime minister had declared during elections that he wanted to be a 'chowkidar' but never clarified who he wanted to guard. The Congress president alleged that he benefited 15-20 industrialists of the country instead of farmers.  According to Gandhi, the former UPA government led by his party had waived farmers' loans worth Rs. 70,000 crore. But bad debt worth Rs. 3.5 lakh crore was written off by the present government and the prime minister did not help farmers with even a one rupee waiver, he alleged.  Gandhi, who is on a two-day visit to the state, named several industrialists, including Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Lalit Modi and Anil Ambani, and said the PM benefited them but did not take care of farmers and youths.  Gandhi claimed the government had destroyed the country's economy with decisions like demonetisation and GST.  Modi, he said, benefited his industrialist friend in Rafale deal and did not speak a single word when he raised the matter in Parliament.  The Congress president said the Centre and state governments worked against people, small scale business, farmers, women and youths.  The former UPA government introduced several schemes and programmes for the poor, including MGNREGA. Moreover, the former Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan had brought free medicines schemes but the BJP governments had weakened them and worked against the people, Gandhi said.  The Congress chief, who is holding a 150 km road show in eastern Rajasthan, will visit Bikaner Wednesday.  Elections in Rajasthan will be held on December 7.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Macroeconomic data, movement of the rupee and trend in global crude oil prices would be crucial for the stock markets this week, say experts. After back-to-back hikes since June, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept interest rates unchanged Friday, surprising markets that had expected a rate hike to support the tumbling rupee and combat inflationary pressures from high oil prices. \"The equity market outlook has taken a beating given degradation in the quality of debt, redemption and heightened risk averseness by investors.  \n\"Trend is likely to be negative at least in the near-term till the financial market stabilises. Key data like bond yield, INR, oil prices, liquidity and equity valuation has to normalise which may take some more time,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.  \n\"The lingering concerns seems to be around crude oil prices, global interest rates and the ongoing global developments on the trade front. Given the status quo, we expect short term rates to ease while long term yields may trade range bound. \n\"The macro needs monitoring and INR and crude oil prices could be leading the way for markets going forward,\" said Lakshmi Iyer, CIO (Debt) and Head of Products, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.  \nStock markets took a beating last week over rupee woes and crude oil prices. The BSE Sensex lost a whopping 1,850.15 points over the week to close at 34,376.99 on Friday.\n \"On economic data front, this week the International Monetary Fund will present its latest World Economic Outlook as it opens its annual meeting with the World Bank in Bali, Indonesia. US September inflation data is due on Thursday. \"In India, data like IIP for August and CPI for September month will be announced this Friday,\" said V K Sharma, Head PCG and Capital Market Strategy, HDFC Securities.  \"Markets have witnessed selling across the board. Even the good quality stocks were battered in line with general markets.  \n\"However, the current fall was in isolation with global developed markets which give a ray of hope that soon a bounce will emerge as valuations have corrected a lot across the board. We think markets will calm down once corporate results start pouring in and given the oversold state of market, sharp rallies can be expected,\" said Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities and StockNote.\nThe Indian rupee crashed below the 74-level against the US dollar for the first time ever Friday.  \n\"Rupee was caught off guard and weakened beyond 74, after RBI surprised markets by keeping rates unchanged. Given the rising oil and trade tensions, traders will bet on exports going up, to curb further weakening in the currency,\" said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.",

Meanwhile, the domestic currency crashed below the 74-mark for the first time ever in intra-day trade on persistent capital outflows and high crude oil prices.Brent crude oil prices declined by over 1 per cent on Monday after Washington said it may grant waivers to sanctions against Iran&rsquo;s oil exports next month, and as Saudi Arabia was said to be replacing any potential shortfall from Iran.International benchmark Brent crude oil futures were at $83.25 per barrel at 0115 GMT, down 91 cents, or 1.1 per cent, from their last close.The US dollar ended slightly lower on Friday unable to capitalise on a rise in US yields.

            "articleBody": " Washington: Growth in India is firming up and projected to accelerate to 7.3 per cent in the 2018-19 fiscal and 7.5 per cent in the next two years, the World Bank said Sunday. The global lender said that the Indian economy appears to have recovered from the temporary disruptions caused by demonetisation and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). However, domestic risks and a less benign external environment impact the macro-economic outlook, it said. Growth reached 6.7 per cent in fiscal year 2017/18, with a significant acceleration in recent months, it said. \"Prompted by the adoption of the 'Goods and Services Tax' (GST) and the recapitalisation of banks, growth in India is firming up and it is projected to accelerate further,\" the World bank said in its latest report on South Asia. Growth in India, it said, is expected to rise to 7.3 per cent in fiscal year 2018/19, and to 7.5 per cent in the following two years, with stronger private spending and export growth as the key drivers. On the production side, the turnaround in the second half was led by manufacturing (that grew at 8.8 per cent versus 2.7 per cent in the first half). Agriculture growth improved, and services growth held steady at 7.7 per cent, the report said. On the demand side, the pick-up in growth was reflected in a sharp acceleration in gross fixed capital formation to 11.7 per cent in the second half, from 3.4 per cent in the first. Consumption, growing at seven per cent in the second half, remained the major driver of growth, the report said. Observing that the external situation has become less favourable and the current account balance has deteriorated, the Bank said that a worsening trade deficit has led the current account deficit to widen -- on the back of a strong import demand, higher oil prices and exchange rate depreciation -- from a benign 0.7 per cent of the GDP in fiscal year 2016/17 to 1.9 per cent in fiscal year 2017/18. External headwinds - monetary policy 'normalisation' in the US coupled with recent stress in some Emerging Market and Developing Economies - have triggered portfolio outflows from April 2018 onwards, the report said. It said that as a result, the nominal exchange rate depreciated by about 12 per cent from January to September 2018, and foreign reserves declined by over 5 per cent since March, while remaining comfortable at about nine months of imports. Of the view that India faces continued internal and external risks, the World Bank said that high oil prices and an uncertain global trade environment may pose challenges for the current account. \"A widening trade deficit is likely to lead to a current account deficit of around 2.6 per cent of the GDP in fiscal year 2018/19, and tighter global financing conditions will put added emphasis on India's ability to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),\" it said. Fiscal consolidation is expected to resume in fiscal year 2018/19, but slippages could happen on both the revenue side (as the GST is still stabilising) and the expenditure side (ahead of state and federal elections), it said. \"Elevated oil prices, a recent hike in agricultural support prices and further exchange rate depreciation could keep the inflation outlook challenging, possibly resulting in further monetary policy actions,\" the report added.",

However, the currency recovered some of the lost ground to settle at 73.77, down 18 paise.The six-member monetary policy committee of the Reserve Bank of India on Friday refrained from increasing the repo rate, the short-term lending rate. The policy rate stands at 6.5 per cent. In post policy press conference, RBI Governor Urjit Patel said that the recent fall in the rupee was moderate compared with other emerging markets. He did not give any band for the rupee-dollar exchange range, saying it is the market which will determine the same.The policy-setting committee headed by Governor Urjit Patel opted to take a pause after hiking the rates in its last two successive policy meetings. The outcome was in contrast to an ET poll, where a majority of 25 economists and analysts had expected the otherwise.Many market experts were hoping for a hike to revive rupee's fortunes.\"This is a risky move by RBI since the market was positioned for a rate hike, purely as a rupee defence. In its absence currency and asset markets could see sharper corrections,\" said Abheek Barua, Chief Economist, HDFC Bank.The rupee on Thursday had slipped 24 paise to hit a fresh record low of 73.58 against the US dollar on Friday, following firm global oil prices, concerns over the current account deficit and capital outflows.&ldquo;Rupee was caught off guard and weakened beyond 74, after RBI surprised markets by keeping rates unchanged. Given the rising oil and trade tensions, traders will bet on exports going up, to curb further weakening in the currency,&rdquo; said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: RBI Governor Urjit Patel on Friday said global economic activity, which has hold up so far, is becoming asynchronous. In a press conference, Patel said the decade-long accommodation by central banks globally is tapering off and emerging markets are facing headwinds from rising crude oil prices. Patel said RBI&rsquo;s forex reserves at present is sufficient to finance 10 months of imports. The recent fall in the rupee, he said, is moderate compared with other emerging markets. He did not give any band for the rupee-dollar exchange range, saying it is the market which will determine the same. Following RBI&rsquo;s policy outcome, the rupee tumbled to a record low of 74.13 to the dollar.Currency depreciation is just adding to the upside risk for emerging markets, Patel said. Patel-headed monetary policy committee (MPC) on Friday shifted its policy stance to &lsquo;calibrated tightening&rsquo; from neutral, while maintaining a status quo on the short-term lending rate. The repo rate stands at 6.5 per cent.Patel noted that global trade was losing pace probably because the ongoing trade war. He said MPC felt global headwinds pose huge risks to the growth and inflation outlook.It is imperative to further strengthen the domestic macroeconomic fundamentals, he said.Patel said kharif sowing has weathered initial setbacks. The outlook for food inflation is benign, he said, adding that the impact of minimum support price (MSP) hike on food inflation is uncertain for now. Any fiscal slippage, he said, would impact inflation outlook. On GDP growth, he said the real growth has been strong, aided by expansion in private consumption and investment. The governor said dollar tightening, escalating tariff wars, country-specific events would be noteworthy.A steep rise in crude prices and hike in minimum support price (MSP) for agri-commodities had stoked inflationary concerns, even as the numbers for first half of FY19 were lower than RBI&rsquo;s estimates. There have also been concerns over tight liquidity in the system.The MPC projected inflation at 4 per cent for September quarter and 3.9 per cent to 4.5 per cent in the second half of this financial year. In its August policy review, the MPC had projected CPI inflation at 4.8 per cent for H2 of FY19.RBI has retained the GDP growth estimate at 7.4 per cent for FY19. It expects economic growth to accelerate to 7.6 per cent in FY20.",

The policy steps taken by the government, both on capital account and  current account management have not been necessarily too effective in managing immediate dollar demand.&rdquo;With the rupee continuing to touch new lows, the Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday allowed forex borrowings for working capital by oil marketing companies -- the largest consumers of foreign currency -- under the automatic route with immediate effect.The central bank has also waived off the $750 million cap that individual state-run refiners had earlier and has capped the overall annual foreign currency borrowing under the new norms at $10 billion with immediate effect.Continued pressure on the currency will however see renewed market clamor for further policy steps to contain pressure on rupee. &ldquo;We think Government will be vigilant henceforth on INR management and additional policy measures could be on the anvil,&rdquo; said Arora.Anindya Banerjeet, currency analyst, Kotak Securities said, &ldquo;A clear hint that Fed is all set to tighten monetary policy much further, hurting money flow into emergin markets. Market may begin to pencil in five more hikes by the end of 2019, instead of four more hikes. US yield curve has bear steepened slightly overnight. As long as the US economy continues to outperform emerging economies and as long as US stock market continues to outperform EM equities, fund flow would continue to hurt EM currencies like Rupee.&rdquo;Earlier during the day, benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty tanked over 2 per cent each.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nBy Bhavik PatelAs expected, the US Fed hiked 25 basis points last Thursday and is on the path to increase another 25 basis point in December. As much as 84 per cent of rate hike in December has already been discounted by the market.Trade war has increased risk sentiment with the US equities trading higher and despite greenback advancing to two-week high post FOMC hike, emerging market currencies such as the rupee is bucking the trend and trading favorably.One of the reasons for DXY (dollar index) trading higher might be weakness in euro. That might explain delayed reaction of DXY moving stronger on Thursday well after FOMC rate hike. Usually, we would see the immediate reaction but since 57 per cent of weightage in DXY is of euro, weak euro propelled DXY higher. \n  \n\n\n\nDXY has fallen four out of six times FOMC has met this year. Chance of buying post FOMC EURO dip did not materialise as Italy risk has raised its ugly head. Italy is Europe&rsquo;s third largest economy and is on a collision course with the EU over its spending plans. Italy&rsquo;s populist leaders will present a budget of 2.4 per cent deficit for the next three years. It will also inflate the country&rsquo;s already mammoth debt burden -currently 131 per cent of GDP -- the biggest in the eurozone after Greece and way above the 60 per cent EU ceiling.\n  \n\n\n\nFollowing Fed&rsquo;s hike, Hong Kong as expected increased 25 basis point increase. Indonesia too raised interest rate while China, Philippines and Taiwan refrained from hiking interest rate. Indian bond market is going through a liquidity crisis, but RBI may still continue its rate hiking cycle. Indian 10-year Govt securities are trading above 8 per cent first time since 2014.\n  \n\n\n\nCurrently, the difference between a three-month paper of a AAA-rated entity and the policy rate is close to 150 basis points, indicating that the market has fully factored in a rate hike.RBI would go for rate hike on the forward looking nature as high oil prices may increase inflation and attract inflows by raising interest rates.Thus we are expecting some support in the rupee on back of rate hike, but overall we still are bearish on the currency given the high crude oil scenario and liquidity crisis in bond market, which will also trigger outflows thus increasing demand for dollar.Thus we may see some halt in rupee during RBI policy, but that halt would be temporary in nature as overall trend still remains bearish.(The author is senior technical analyst at Tradebulls Securities)",

            "articleBody": "\n\nNew Delhi: Domestic stock markets crashed big time early today as benchmark indices fell more than 1.50 per cent. The 30-share Sensex was down as much as 850 points around 12.00 pm while the 50-share Nifty tumbled nearly 250 points to test the 10,600-mark.As many as 41 stocks on the Nifty were in the red, with Eicher Motors, Reliance Industries, Tech Mahindra, TCS and GAIL falling 2-5 per cent. On the other hand, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Hindalco, Bharti Infratel, Tata Steel and Wipro advanced 0.50-4 per cent.Mood was decidedly cautious ahead of the RBI policy meeting decision tomorrow.What dampened market sentiment? Here are five factors.Rupee at record low: A falling rupee weighed heavy on investor sentiment. The local currency plunged to its fresh record low of 73.77 against the dollar early Thursday. The Indian unit on Wednesday crashed below the 73 mark against the dollar for the first time ever. The dollar index stood tall against other currencies, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.&ldquo;Dollar dominated the last 24 hours as the rupee collapsed to a fresh all-time low on spot. Policymakers tried everything, monetary intervention, and verbal steroids and even tried to circulate rumours about an \"oil window\". Nothing worked. The RBI added fuel to fire by denying any attempts to introduce special dollar window for the oil marketing companies. Oil was on the boil, local equity and bond markets were under the hammer. If that was not enough, rising Italian credit spreads whacked the euro, further pressuring the rupee,&rdquo; Kotak Securities said in a report.Boiling oil: Brent crude was trading over $86 per barrel in morning deals while WTI crude was above $76 per barrel. Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities, said, &ldquo;Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to Brent crude movements and with the current pace, 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.&rdquo;Rising bond yields: Hardening bond yields are creating waves of panic in the domestic equity market. India&rsquo;s 10-year bond yield was hovering above 8.18 per cent on Thursday against previous close of 8.11 per cent. Bond yields have spiked 84 basis points on a year-to-date basis.Foreign capital outflows: Investors remained concerned over sustained foreign money outflows as foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 455.02 crore in October so far. They sold shares worth Rs 1,488.96 crore in September. However, their net investment stood at Rs 262.72 crore in August, as per data available with depository NSDL. According to the data released by the NSE, FIIs were net sellers of Rs 2,056.87 crore in index futures and options segments, according to Wednesday&rsquo;s data. FIIs were net sellers of index futures to the tune of Rs 699.54 crore and net sellers of index options worth Rs 1357.33 crore.US Treasury yields reached multi-year peaks, with the 10-year note's yield at its highest since 2014 and maturities at the short end of the curve at decade highs after economic data on Wednesday bolstered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December and beyond.Weak Asian cues: Subdued Asian markets spoiled market sentiment too. Japan's Nikkei edged lower in choppy trade on Thursday morning as investors took profit from its recent rally to a 27-year high while automakers and technology heavyweights took limelight on news of technology tie-ups for self-driving cars. Nikkei225 was trading 0.46 per cent down at 23,999 while Hang Seng came down over 1.50 per cent at 26,628.64.",

            "articleBody": "While it is not clear how much Metrobikes is aiming to raise, it will be part of the ongoing round of fundraising as it competes with Ola-backed Vogo in the space. MUMBAI: International Finance Corporation (IFC), a World Bank group member, on Wednesday extended a seven-year long-term loan of Rs 1,000 crore to Aditya Birla Finance (ABFL). ABFL, the NBFC arm of Aditya Birla Capital, would use the proceeds to finance renewable energy projects and help the country move towards its target of 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022. \"This is not just about a loan but also about being able to access the expertise that IFC has in this area and together making a small difference to the energy requirements of our country,\" Aditya Birla Capital's chief executive Ajay Srinivasan, said in a release. The government plans to increase the country's renewable energy capacity to 175 GW, comprising solar, wind, biomass, and small hydro, by 2022. With this funding, IFC would help ABFL develop its renewable energy program by providing longer-tenor financing, knowledge sharing, and setting of standards. IFC brings to the partnership its deep understanding of the renewable energy sector. The project complements IFCs India Country Strategy for FY17-21, which commits to enabling electricity access for 60 million people, creation of 25 GW of installed renewable capacity, and contributing 11 per cent to the total energy-related greenhouse gas avoidance potential. The IFC green loan, sanctioned in March 2018, is an Indian rupee loan under track III of the Reserve Bank of India's guidelines for external commercial borrowings.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The rupee on Wednesday closed below 73 level for the first time ever against the US dollar after crude oil prices edged up on expectations of tighter markets once US sanctions target Iran's petroleum industry from next month.The local currency settled 43 paise down at 73.34 against the American currency. Rushabh Maru, Research Analyst, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers said, &ldquo;The rupee has made a new record low on the back of consistent rise in the crude oil prices. Sharp volatility in the domestic equities and steep FIIs outflows from equity and debt segments keeping sentiments bearish for the rupee.&rdquo; Brent crude oil was hovering around $85 per barrel in the afternoon trade, while WTI crude was above $75 per barrel.Earlier in the day, the benchmark BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty slipped more than 1.50 per cent each. There are expectations that sharp rise in the crude oil prices along with steep depreciation in the rupee might push inflation higher in coming months. The dollar index is hovering around multi-months high as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates aggressively. Focus would now shift to the RBI monetary policy meeting. There is a buzz of repo rate hike by 25 bps and possible change in the monetary policy stance by the RBI. More importantly, its guidance will be crucial.&ldquo;Market will also keenly watch whether the RBI announces any crucial measures to stabilise the rupee. In the near term, the rupee might trade in 72.50 and 73.80 range,&rdquo; Maru said.Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities said, &ldquo;Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by government for stability in rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to brent crude movements and with current pace 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": " Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu will chair an inter-ministerial meeting Thursday to discuss the depreciating rupee and widening trade deficit, an official said.The meeting will deliberate upon ways to address India's trade deficit in goods and pressure on the rupee, the official added.Representatives from the department of economic affairs, coal ministry, steel ministry, oil ministry and department of pharmaceuticals are expected to attend the meeting.The meeting assumes significance as the rupee has hit an all-time high of 73.74 against the US dollar, which would raise India's import bill and widen the trade deficit (difference between imports and exports).The trade deficit was at a five-year high of $18.02 billion in July. It came down to $17.4 billion in August.During the April-August period this fiscal, the country's exports recorded a growth of 16.13 per cent, while imports grew by 17.34 per cent.The depreciating rupee puts pressure on the country's oil import bill.The domestic currency has depreciated nearly 13 per cent since the beginning of this year. Besides having impact on current account deficit, the sliding rupee has made imports costlier and led to oil prices skyrocketing to record highs. India is the third largest importer of crude oil.Oil imports during the first five months of the current fiscal rose by 53.55 per cent to $58.81 billion.Since 2011-12, India's exports have been hovering at around $300 billion. During 2017-18, the shipments grew by about 10 per cent to $303 billion.Promoting exports helps a country to create jobs, boost manufacturing and earn more foreign exchange.",

Moreover, export sales strengthened, with the net gain the best recorded since the start of the year. &ldquo;High product quality was noted as a factor supporting total new order book growth,&rdquo; it said.Smith said rising prices continued to weigh on sentiment as a strong US dollar and supply shortages exacerbated high global prices for steel and fuel.The survey showed that optimism about future output slipped to the lowest since June.",

            "articleBody": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMUMBAI: India&rsquo;s monetary policy makers may raise rates for the third time in the current cycle later this week, with the central bank seeking to maintain a delicate balance between meeting the liquidity needs of a nervous capital market and restraining inflation amid a steep fall in the rupee&rsquo;s value.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is widely expected to raise the benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point when the policy is announced Friday, according to an ET poll conducted among 25 market participants.\n  \n\nIndeed, the pace of consumer price rise has softened in India. But experts are factoring in the possibility of future price rises on account of a steep depreciation of the local currency and oil price shocks.&ldquo;Notwithstanding the recent easing of CPI readings, it may be necessary to keep our rate structure in tune with the rising interest rates in the developed market space, including the US, and to the rising strength of the US dollar. Inaction from our central bank at this stage might result in a perception risk that we are falling behind the curve,&rdquo; said B Prasanna, ICICI Bank group executive and head for markets.Emerging economies such as Indonesia and the Philippines have raised their rates aggressively to shore up their currencies.Shashank Mendiratta, India economist at ANZ Bank, said that India may require a series of rate increases as has been the case in Indonesia, but RBI can afford to wait and watch before reacting to the upside risks to inflation as the CPI prints for July and August have surprised to the downside.Retail inflation cooled to an 11-month low of 3.69 per cent in August, mainly due to a fall in prices of kitchen items, including fruits and vegetables, official data showed. Yet, 24 out of 25 respondents to the ET poll voted in favour of a likely rate increase.&ldquo;We expect the Monetary Policy Committee to tilt toward greater caution with the objective of containing aggregate demand as well as to push real interest rates higher,&rdquo; said Siddharth Sanyal, India chief economist at Barclays.&ldquo;There was a very strong expectation of a 50 basis points hike in repo rate priced in by the market just a few days earlier. However, with the recent liquidity issues concerning IL&amp;FS and other NBFCs, RBI may opt for a more conservative hike of 25 bps,&rdquo; ICICI Bank&rsquo;s Prasanna said.A majority of participants expect guidance from the central bank on banking system liquidity, which was in deficit of more than Rs 1 lakh crore until a few days ago.&ldquo;The RBI is facing a conundrum after a long gap,&rdquo; said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at IIFL Securities. &ldquo;However, liquidity may freeze if 50 bps rate hike is announced without short-term liquidity measures.&rdquo;&ldquo;Markets now unambiguously expect a nuanced communication from RBI in restoring confidence in the markets following the recent upheavals,&rdquo; said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at SBI, which expects 50 bps rise in FY19.With the currency still under pressure and crude oil prices crossing $80, the rate increase cycle is far from over.&ldquo;We expect the RBI to emphasise on the forward-looking nature of the monetary policy, as high oil prices and a weak rupee risk hardening inflationary expectations, and disrupt the benign inflation outlook,&rdquo; said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Bank.&ldquo;The inflation forecast for FY20 will be important to watch,&rdquo; said Anubhuti Sahay, Standard Chartered Bank&rsquo;s economics research head for South Asia.",

            "articleBody": " Global Oil prices are hardening yet again, and the weaker rupee seems likely to further increase retail prices of automotive fuel. The Centre needs to stick to its resolve not to reduce retail taxes on the main petroleum products, diesel and petrol. Because doing so would lead to considerable slippages in the budgeted fiscal deficit target, quite needlessly boost market borrowings of the Centre, and which in turn would likely rev up inflationary expectations across the board.Besides, reducing consumption taxes on oil would shore up runaway demand for road fuel, and that, in turn, would only worsen the rising current account deficit. And yet, the Centre would do well to have a plan B in place, should oil prices flare up. True, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime has not been extended to petrol and diesel. But the Centre could still use the forum of the GST Council to drive home the point, albeit informally, that there is scope to reduce ad-valorem retail state taxes on petrol and diesel. Also, the Centre on its own can extend central GST to diesel and petrol. The next government surely needs to do away with the current cascading tax-on-tax regime for the main petro-products, heavily taxed at each stage of output, and instead proactively broaden the indirect tax base economy-wide. It is anomalous to garner about 40% of indirect taxes from one item: Oil. ",

Rahul is on a two days visit in the city.Photo/Mahesh Kumar A.) CHITRAKOOT: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said changes will be made to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to reduce rates on items, if his party comes to power.On a visit to various places in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, he also continued his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Rafale fighter deal, alleging that \"the watchman has indulged in theft.\"Gandhi, who began his two-day tour of Madhya Pradesh, was addressing a gathering after visiting the famous Kamta Nath temple in this religious town associated with Lord Rama.He said the Modi government has \"destroyed\" small businesses and employment through demonetisation and 'Gabbar Singh Tax', a reference to GST.\"As soon as we come to power, we will change the 'Gabbar Singh Tax' into the real tax. We will implement one tax at lowest rates,\" the Congress leader said.He said all power would be used to generate employment.GST, which brought a one-tax regime in the country, was rolled out last year.Turning to the Rafale deal, Gandhi said, \"Hindustan ke chowkidar ne chori kar li hai\" (India's watchman has indulged in theft).\"His reference was clearly to Modi who had said that he would be the country's 'chowkidar' in his capacity as the prime minister.\"The man, who claims to be the country's watchman, has himself put Rs 30,000 crore in the pocket of (industrialist) Anil Ambani in the Rafale deal,\" Gandhi claimed.Describing Anil Ambani as Modi's \"friend\", the Congress leader alleged that the industrialist has a debt of Rs 45,000 crore.He claimed that Anil Ambani had not manufactured even a single aircraft but was awarded a contract of Rs 30,000-crore after \"snatching\" the work from state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).\"The 'chowkidar' took out the money from the pockets of the poor, the youth and other people and put it into the pocket of Ambani... This money belongs to the people of the country,\" Gandhi alleged.Ambani has already rejected Rahul Gandhi's allegations and emphasised that the government had no role in the Rafale- manufacturer French company Dassault picking up his company as a local partner.He had written to Gandhi on December 12, 2017, refuting allegations of his Reliance Group lacking experience to get the Rafale fighter jet deal.He had written that Reliance Defence has the largest shipyard in the private sector at Pipavav in Gujarat and is currently building five Naval Offshore Patrol Vessels (NOPVs) for the Indian Navy and 14 Fast Patrol Vessels for the Indian Coast Guard.In his speech, Gandhi also accused Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of speaking untruth on the Rafale deal issue.\"In Parliament, the defence minister said the price of Rafale fighter plane can't be disclosed due to secret pact. I met the French president, who said there is no such pact and the price can be disclosed,\" the Congress chief said.The prime minister also spoke for one-and-a-half hour in Parliament but did not talk about Rafale issue, he added.Gandhi also reiterated his promise of waiving the farmers' loan within ten days, if elected to power in Madhya Pradesh.Earlier, he reached Chitrakoot from Allahabad by a helicopter and visited the Kamta Nath temple where he performed 'puja'.The temple is located in the forested hills of Kamadgiri where, according to mythology, Lord Rama stayed during his exile.The 48-year-old Amethi MP was accompanied by Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath, state party campaign committee chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia and Leader of Opposition in MP Assembly Ajay Singh.Senior party leader from the state Digvijaya Singh was conspicuous by his absence.The visit is part of the Congress' campaign for the Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh due later this year.The Congress has been out of power in Madhya Pradesh since 2003.During his earlier visit on September 17, Gandhi held a roadshow in Bhopal after performing a puja and taking blessings from 11 priests.

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu will next week review sector-specific strategies to increase India&rsquo;s exports 20 per cent this year amid an uncertain global trade environment and credit availability. The ministry has identified nine sectors, including gems &amp; jewellery, leather, textiles, agriculture and pharmaceuticals, to drive India&rsquo;s exports to $400 billion in the next five years. These sectors accounted for $242 billion or 80 per cent of the country&rsquo;s total exports of $302 billion in 2017-18.Prabhu had earlier asked exporters to prepare action plans and develop strategies to double India&rsquo;s exports by 2025 to help create jobs, bring in foreign exchange and validate India&rsquo;s international competitiveness.&ldquo;The minister will review the action plans on October 1. This is in continuation of the series of meetings that he has had with export promotion councils and secretaries of line ministries concerned,&rdquo; an official aware of the matter told ET on condition of anonymity.Besides export promotion councils, the minister will separately meet officials of other departments concerned.\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIndia&rsquo;s exports grew 16 per cent in April-August compared to that a year ago.&ldquo;Doubling exports should not be such a big challenge. However, domestic constraints such as credit need to be linked into,&rdquo; said Ajay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.ET had earlier reported that exporters were told not to come up with incentives related to the Merchandise Exports of India Scheme as it was under review, with the US disputing it in the World Trade Organisation.Sector-specific strategies are necessary in view of diverse challenges such as uncertainty of global trade, rigid approach of banks which is affecting availability of credit, high logistics costs and productivity standards.Exporters have raised concerns over the slack flow of credit to exporters, high goods and services tax on gold and strict pollution norms for chemicals, besides currency fluctuations, citing these factors as hindrances to export growth. Prabhu recently wrote to finance minister Arun Jaitley, requesting his intervention to improve bank credit flow to the export sector.",

            "articleBody": " MUMBAI: In more troubles for the crippled IL&amp;FS group, India Ratings Tuesday downgraded the long-term issuer rating of a group company, IL&amp;FS Environmental Infrastructure and Services (IEISL), and placed its ratings under watch. The agency has also downgraded the ratings of various debt instruments to 'BB'. Rival rating agency Icra had last month junked the ratings of most of the group companies. The downgrade by India Ratings reflects a similar rating action on its parent IL&amp;FS following the default on repayment of commercial papers. Monday, IL&amp;FS Financial Services defaulted on interest payments of commercial papers, which were due on that day. On September 14, IL&amp;FS, which is unbale to service most of its over Rs 91,000 crore debt, had defaulted on a Rs 105-core CP redemption. \"The recent developments at IL&amp;FS will affect IEISL's financial flexibility with regards to raising fresh equity and debt,\" the rating agency said in a note. IL&amp;FS holds 97.54 per cent stake in IEISL and has provided equity and debt to it, giving financial flexibility in terms of repayment of debt and interest. The parent's liquidity tightness poses challenges to IEISL in meeting its immediate debt liabilities, it said, adding the possibility of the rollover of its borrowings has diminished significantly in the short term. Although IL&amp;FS plans to raise about Rs 8,000 crore in equity and debt, and monetise some assets, the timeliness of the debt and equity raising and proceeds from the divestment is critical, the rating agency said. It said IL&amp;FS would require immediate liquidity support to honour its debt obligations in a timely manner. IEISL also plans to raise equity of Rs 238 crore through rights issue to part pay IL&amp;FS' debt. IEISL is into waste processing business and is of strategic importance to IL&amp;FS to serve its social objectives.",

Though this is an approximately 21 per cent decline from overall median gross salary of Rs. 277.1 per hour in 2015, the sector is the only one amongst the eight captured in MSI to see a notable increase (9 per cent) in median gross hourly salary.In 2017, manufacturing has also been the second highest-earning sector in India and with the exception of the IT sector, manufacturing also remains the only other sector that paid median gross salary of above Rs. 200 per hour threshold.The report said that the IT sector paid median wage at Rs. 317.6 per hour, the highest among all monitored sectors, but 17.8 per cent less than the last year. This is one of the reasons why more than half (51 per cent) were not satisfied with their jobs. Some other aspects contributing to job dissatisfaction are commuting time, work-life balance, and working hours. Interestingly, employees in the IT sector are most satisfied with their relationships at work. They rated their relationships with colleagues and supervisors a high 90 per cents.Sharing his views, Abhijeet Mukherjee, CEO, Monster.com, APAC and Gulf said, &ldquo;As Industry 4.0 continues to gain wider acceptance and reshapes the manufacturing industry, India is well positioned to become one of the largest manufacturing economies in the world. The momentum is mirrored by the increased median gross hourly wage recorded for the manufacturing sector in the Monster Salary Index. There are already clear signs of green shoots sprouting in pockets of local manufacturing in sectors as diverse as steel, auto, chemicals and energy and this is also reflected in the 60 per cent y-o-y growth in online hiring in the production &amp; manufacturing sector till July 2018, as reported by Monster Employment Index.&rdquo;The advent of automation and AI has brought about some uncertainty, but job creation is expected to continue with an impetus on upskilling and re-skilling the current workforce, added Mukherjee. The IT and BFSI sectors have shown a correction in wages and it isn&rsquo;t surprising that pay satisfaction is low with only over 40 per cent of employees satisfied with their salaries.",

This is 49 per cent higher than the same quarter of the last fiscal. During 2017-18, banks recovered Rs 74,562 crore.According to sources, the meeting will review annual financial performance of public sector banks, credit offtake in the economy, priority sector lending and progress made under various social sector schemes, including Atal Pension Yojana (APY) and Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY).The cumulative loss of public sector banks crossed Rs 87,357 crore in 2017-18, with scam-tainted Punjab National Bank topping the chart with a hit of nearly Rs 12,283 crore, followed by IDBI Bank.Of the 21 state-owned banks, only two - Indian Bank and Vijaya Bank - reported profits in 2017-18. Indian Bank posted the highest profit of Rs 1,258.99 crore and Vijaya Bank's profit worked out to be Rs 727.02 crore.The remaining 19 government-run banks collectively suffered a net loss of Rs 87,357 crore during the financial year, according to the latest quarterly numbers reported by these lenders. All the 21 banks had together reported a net profit of Rs 473.72 crore in 2016-17.The Indian banking sector is grappling with mounting non-performing assets and a host of scams and frauds.The gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) plus restructured standard advances in the banking system remained elevated at 12.1 per cent of gross advances at March-end 2018.The aggregate gross NPAs of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) increased primarily as a result of this transparent recognition of stressed assets as NPAs, from Rs 3,23,464 crore, as on March 31, 2015, to Rs 10,35,528 crore, as on March 31, 2018.",

            "articleBody": " MUMBAI: The currency in circulation (CiC), which increased exponentially after the note ban in November 2016 under which as many as 99.9 per cent of them returned to the system, has seen some slowdown in expansion since May this year likely due to higher fuel prices and Reserve Bank's intervention in forex market, says a report.Currency in circulation increased from Rs 9 trillion in January 2017 to Rs 19.5 trillion as of September 14 this year. But since the beginning of May 2018, the same has been in the range of Rs 19-19.6 trillion, says the report.\"One possible reason can be people may be cutting back discretionary spending with the recent spurt in fuel prices, mostly in rural areas,\" says SBI Research in a report Monday.The other factor could be to the extent RBI selling dollars directly from its foreign exchange reserves to designated dealers/banks thereby withdrawing rupee resources in return, thus reducing currency in circulation, it said.The report, however, said such intervention, since taking place between banks, should not have major impact on systemic liquidity.The third reason, though insignificant, could also be RBI replacing soiled notes, it added.The decline in CiC is a seasonal phenomenon but this time it seems the decline is more than just seasonal and has continued beyond August, it noted.The Reserve Bank's weekly data for the last 10 years shows a pattern in CiC decline in the last fortnight of every July, which is partly explained by the low cash demand from the agriculture sector.The demand for currency increases after the monsoons as the harvesting begins in October followed by Rabi sowing, eventually giving rise to cash requirement.The festive season also brings along its natural demand, which gets accentuated with buying of gold, automobiles, increasing the demand for currency, the report added.

            "articleBody": " MUMBAI: The Indian government's decision to boost capital inflows in an attempt to curtail rupee slide might not work. Thats what rating agency Moody's said in its research note on Monday as it believes that the government's recently announced measures to maintain its fiscal deficit target are unlikely to reverse the rupee slide, and perhaps might even slow down the currency further. The Indian rupee has fallen more than 10 per cent against the US dollar since January 2018 and was at INR72.1 against the dollar as of 21 September. India&rsquo;s current-account deficit too has widened to 2.4 per cent of GDP in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from 1.9 per cent the previous quarter, driven by higher oil and non-oil imports. To address this the government earlier this month announced a range of measures some of them include to make it less expensive for Indian companies to borrow abroad and incentivise foreign investment in Indian bond markets. Moody's picks the finance ministry's move to exempt investors from withholding tax for offshore rupee denominated (masala) bonds issued in the year 2019. The other interventions include, removal of single exposure limit of 20 per cent on foreign portfolio investors for corporate bonds. On the borrowing side, the government announced this month that it has lowered the minimum maturity of external commercial borrowings of upto $50 million to one year from three years. However the rating agency is of the view that these measures will likely take time to affect capital inflows, and even though the potential removal of hedging requirements could reduce some short-term pressure on the rupee, it could also heighten corporates' exposure to currency fluctuations. However Moody's thinks that India's macroeconomic fundamentals still outweigh the risks as the current CAD is still narrower than the near 5 per cent of the GDP that India witnessed during 2013, where even the currency depreciated by almost 20 per cent. But the subsidies on Liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene will raise expenditures and add to existing pressures on India's fiscal position- some of them include lowering of goods and services tax rates on a range of consumer goods and a tax cut for small businesses, as well as the relatively high minimum support prices set for this year.",

Job addition numbers, which are based on new members enrolled in various social security schemes of EPFO such as pension, PF and insurance, were 9,51,423 in July -- the highest in any month since September 2017 when the retirement fund body started releasing payroll data.  In total, as many as 61,81,943 jobs were created during September 2017 to July 2018 period, the payroll data showed.  The EPFO also revised upward the number of new enrolments from September 2017 to June 2018 to 52.30 lakh from 47.13 lakh estimated earlier last month.  In July, the maximum number of enrolment of 2,68,021 were recorded in the age bracket of 18 to 21 years followed by 2,54,827 in 22 to 25 age group.  The data is provisional as updating of employees records is a continuous process and gets updated in subsequent months, the EPFO said in a statement.  It also stated that the estimates may include temporary employees, whose contributions may not be continuous for the entire year.  For each age-wise band, the estimates are net of the members enrolled and ceased during the month as per the EPFO records, it added.  The EPFO manages social security funds of workers in the organised/ semi organised sector. It runs three social security scheme Employees' Provident Fund Scheme 1952, Employees' Deposit Linked Scheme 1976 (EDLI) and Employees' Pension Scheme 1995. It manages the accounts of over six crore members and a corpus of over Rs 10 lakh crore.  Earlier this year, the EPFO had started the practice of updating payroll data on its official portal. The body had also lowered its payroll data estimates earlier.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The rupee is expected to remain under pressure in near-term as the downside risks to the currency are largely driven by the external factors and will take some time to subside, says a report. According to Dun &amp; Bradsteet's latest economy forecast, elevated crude oil prices, strengthening of dollar, geopolitical tensions and economic sanctions will continue to impart depreciation pressures on the rupee. \"Elevated risks and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, trade wars and economic sanctions along with reworking of trade treaties will continue to impact emerging market currencies, including India,\" Dun &amp; Bradstreet India Lead Economist Arun Singh said in a research note.\nAt this time of global uncertainty along with tightening dollar liquidity in the global market, measures to attract foreign investors to support the rupee might have limited impact, at least, in the short-term. The rupee has logged year-to-date losses of more than 13 per cent against the strengthening US dollar after trade concerns and firming up crude oil prices. It has dropped close to 6 per cent since August.\nThe rupee Wednesday rebounded by 61 paise to close at 72.37 against the US currency.\nOn the government's recent initiatives to support rupee, the report said the measures were \"initial\" and more is expected.\nSingh further noted that \"if the government undertakes measures like curbing non-essential imports it will be favourable for the domestic industry and the current account balance but at the same time it might send out protectionist signals\".\nD&amp;B expects the rupee to be around 72.3 - 72.5 per US dollar during September.\n\"The fact that rupee remains undervalued as per the 6-currency trade based REER (real effective exchange rate) index and there are adequate forex reserves to support rupee, the current level might not be the new normal for rupee,\" Singh added.",

            "articleBody": " India&rsquo;s central bank has enough reserves to defend the rupee, according to the State Bank of India and Nomura Holdings Inc., as the currency shrugged off the government&rsquo;s supportive measures to plunge to a fresh record.The Reserve Bank of India can sell an additional $25 billion, at least, in the foreign-exchange market, SBI estimates, based on intervention patterns since the 1990s. The nation&rsquo;s reserves adequacy remains among the highest in the region, says Nomura, adding that forex cover, including the forwards book, could fall by as much as $100.8 billion before reaching the August 2013 levels which triggered a bond sale to overseas Indians to mop up reserves, it said.The central bank has been slowing its intervention efforts in recent months as emerging markets faced a rout and oil prices surged. It has stated from time to time that it is concerned with curbing excessive volatility and doesn&rsquo;t target a specific rupee level. FX reserves are sufficient to cover eight months of imports compared to the IMF&rsquo;s usual prescription of three months.&ldquo;This is possibly a reflection of the fact that as an inflation targeting central bank, RBI may be concerned about the exchange rate only to the extent it feeds inflation,&rdquo; Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at SBI, wrote in a note. &ldquo;The markets may not have understood this nuance and thus were expecting more from the RBI also.&rdquo;\n  \n\n\n\nThe RBI intervened aggressively during April to June, with $24.6 billion of drawdown in reserves, including its forward book. However, data show that FX intervention slowed to $1.9 billion of net selling in July, and then an estimated $3.6 billion in August, according to Nomura.India unveiled measures to prop up the sagging rupee on Friday, including steps to facilitate bond issuance by local companies and possible curbs on imports. However, markets gave a thumbs down to the proposals, with the rupee dropping 1.5% so far this week to close at 72.975 to a dollar on Tuesday.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The rupee on Wednesday opened 27 paise higher at 72.70 against the US dollar on account of some selling of American currency by banks and exporters. The rupee on Tuesday slipped 46 paise to a record low of 72.97 against the greenback due to surging crude oil prices and escalating trade war worries. Panic dollar demand from importers and speculative traders further dampened the forex market sentiment. US President Donald Trump Monday night announced to impose additional 10 per cent duties on Chinese imports worth $200 billion.After turning net buyers in the months of July and August, FIIs once again have turned net sellers in the equity markets in September. They have offloaded shared worth over Rs 3,500 crore this month so far, while their net investment stood at Rs 2,264 crore and Rs 1,775 crore in July and August, respectively. Himanshu Srivastava, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar said, &ldquo;There are many factors which are being watched closely by FIIs while taking decision to invest in India.\"India&rsquo;s progress on the economic growth front, impact of surging crude prices and depreciating rupee on the country&rsquo;s macro outlook, prospects of further rate hike by the US Fed and escalating trade war tensions are the leading once. Given most of these factors are themselves dynamic in nature, the direction of FII flows changes with them. A glimpse of the same can be seen in the pattern of FII flows this year so far.&rdquo;",

SBI has asked the interested ARCs/FIs to conduct the due diligence of these assets with immediate effect after submitting expression of interest and executing a non-disclosure agreement with the bank.  The e-bidding for these accounts will take place on September 26.  Earlier in August, the lender had put two non-performing assets (NPAs) worth Rs 2,490 crore for sale to ARCs/FIs.

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The government proposed the merger of three banks &mdash; Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank &mdash;aimed at creating the country&rsquo;s third-biggest lender.That&rsquo;s seen as preparing the ground for consolidation among the remaining 17 state-owned lenders that have been a drain on the exchequer and marking the next big move in banking reforms. The boards of the three banks will now consider the proposal.The combined entity will have a strong presence across the nation with more than 34% of low-cost deposits, a capital buffer of nearly 12% and a business book of Rs 14.82 lakh crore. Bank of Baroda is the biggest of the three with Rs 10.29 lakh crore of total business, followed by Vijaya Bank at Rs 2.79 lakh crore and Dena Bank at Rs 1.72 lakh crore. &ldquo;The government has suggested this to the banks to consider these proposals, and hopefully shortly the boards will meet and after adequate consultation will take a decision,&rdquo; said finance minister Arun Jaitley.The consolidation was proposed by the alternative mechanism comprising chairperson Arun Jaitley and cabinet ministers Piyush Goyal and Nirmala Sitharaman.Jaitley observed that the government is seeking to ensure that there is no merger of relatively weak banks and that it has held talks with the Reserve Bank of India.&ldquo;You can have two well-performing banks absorbing a third one, and hopefully creating a mega bank which will be sustainable, whose lending ability will be far higher,&rdquo; he said, adding that nobody should have a worry because this amalgamated entity will increase banking operations. &ldquo;Its (merged entity) ability to increase and expand will be inevitable.&rdquo;\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe merger proposal was made public after markets closed. Bank of Baroda ended 0.41% up Rs 135.10 on the BSE. Vijaya Bank rose 0.93% to Rs 59.80 while Dena Bank fell 0.62% to Rs 15.95.The finance ministry said in a release that the envisaged amalgamation will be first ever three-way consolidation of banks in India.&ldquo;The merger will help improve operational efficiency and customer services,&rdquo; financial services secretary Rajiv Kumar said, adding that the merger would involve synergies in the branch network, low-cost deposits and subsidiaries.He said employees would be protected, brand equity will be preserved and that the government will continue to provide capital support to the merged entity.&ldquo;A scheme of amalgamation, which will be formed, will be laid before Parliament,&rdquo; he said.Previously, the government had pushed through consolidation of the State Bank of India group, with SBI absorbing five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank. That process was completed last year.The finance ministry stated that the provision coverage ratio (PCR) of the proposed amalgamated entity will be 67.5%, well above the average of public sector banks (PSBs) at 63.7%.The capital adequacy ratio of the combined entity would be at 12.25%, significantly above the regulatory norm of 10.875%, the finance ministry said, adding that it would be better positioned to tap capital markets.&ldquo;The consolidation will help create a strong global competitive bank with economies of scale and enable realisation of wide-ranging synergies,&rdquo; the statement noted.Bank of Baroda managing director PS Jayakumar said that the bank&rsquo;s board will meet shortly to discuss the amalgamation. &ldquo;The whole process may take up to six months but we can try and speed things up,&rdquo; he said. Jaitley also said that no employee will face service terms that are in any way adverse in nature to the prevailing rules.&ldquo;On the contrary, the State Bank of India (SBI) experience has been that amongst the merging entity and new entity, the best of service conditions continue to apply to all of them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So, employees of relatively smaller banks will get an opportunity to improve their working condition.&rdquo;.",

Government sources said import duty may be imposed on items like steel, finished steel, furniture, electronics, food items like fruits, almonds and others. The government is also weighing options to increase import duty on gold, as it sees the risk of a possible spike in gold smuggling if import duty is too harsh.US tariff measures and a rising dollar are the key reasons behind the fall in the rupee. Government finances have also been under pressure from rising oil prices. The government expects oil prices to move up further when Iran oil goes offline in November following US sanctions. On Friday, the government announced a series of steps, including removal of withholding tax on masala bonds, relaxation for foreign portfolio investments and curbs on non-essential imports to contain the widening CAD and check the rupee depreciation.The government is said to be planning a series of stake sales in various PSUs over the next four months and expects the rupee to stabilise in the medium term.",

            "articleBody": "\n   If raising money through external commercial borrowing or a Masala Bond could be put in the automatic route, dollar entry into India will be faster and that will help the rupee, Keki Mistry, VC &amp; CEO, HDFC, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: It does not seem like the rupee is taking its cues at all from the 5-pronged strategy announced by the finance minister over the weekend. It almost seems that the market anticipated this move and it is turning out to be a buy on rumour, sell on decline kind of a story in currency today? Well, I guess, it is a case of global factors being extremely negative from our perspective. Oil prices being where they are, US economy being where it is, strength of the US dollar, all these factors are obviously weighing in on the currency. What was announced on Friday was positive. It is a good measure but I wish a little more could have been done. For example, we have removed withholding tax from Masala Bonds but it continues on external commercial borrowings. The minimum period for which the money could be raised either through Masala Bonds or through the ECB route is now five years but there is relative demand for five-year money. There is more demand for three-year money. If we reduced the term from five to three years, that would also go a long way in getting more money into India.Lastly, the process of getting the approvals could be put through the automatic route. If raising money through external commercial borrowing or a Masala Bond could be put in the automatic route, it would expedite the process and dollar entry into India will be faster and that will help the rupee.So you do not believe that the exemption from withholding tax for issuance of Masala Bonds is going to reduce the cost of borrowing significantly? Obviously, it will reduce the cost of borrowing but if you borrow money from overseas, there are two ways you can do it. One is you borrow money through Masala Bonds which is rupee-denominated bonds. The other is to borrow money through external commercial borrowing which is dollar-denominated borrowing. The withholding tax has been removed for Masala Bonds and that is extremely positive but it has not been done for external commercial borrowings.When you talk about how you have read into these measures and saying that a little more could have been done as well, do you think that perhaps if push comes to shove, restoring buyer&rsquo;s credit, raising interest rates, could be resorted to?Raising interest rates might be the most logical economic answer that an economist would knew but I am not too sure that is the right strategy because already interest rates are high. What we need to do perhaps is the couple of other things. First, we need to infuse more liquidity into the system not that that is going to help the currency but at least it will give a push to infusing liquidity. We should discourage imports of non-essential items and encourage exports. Via levy of import duty, imports could be discouraged for non-essential items. Oil purchases by oil companies should be directly from the reserves of the RBI and not from the market and that would stem some of the volatility that we are seeing. Lastly we should have some more money from NRIs, but not through bonds and rather through NRI loan issue which is a non-tradable instrument. One of the measures to be announced was the mandatory hedging conditions for infrastructure loans that will be reviewed. What kind of relaxation is expected here and do you think easing the mandatory conditions will make is cheaper for infrastructure companies to raise funds or refinance costlier debt?  I am not so sure of that because allowing infrastructure companies to borrow money without hedging it, is going to be little difficult. Infrastructure companies&rsquo; earnings are always very volatile. In that kind of an environment, letting them not hedge their borrowings is a little dicey. There is now a requirement by RBI that floating rate borrowings have to be compulsorily hedged into a fixed rate borrowing. Hedging currencies is important but hedging the interest rate, converting the floating rate liability into a fixed rate liability may or may not be necessary because that makes the cost of borrowing money from overseas that much more expensive and so that is something which could be done away with.Manufacturing companies are allowed to avail ECBs of up to $50 million with the minimum maturity of one year versus three years. How are you reading into this move in terms of dollar borrowing? That is good. I would say that you should extend that not just to the manufacturing companies but to other industries as well because that way you can get money faster. There is appetite amongst foreign lenders to give money in the short-term markets and not so much in the long -term markets. So, any borrowing of one year, three years will do reasonably well but a borrowing of five years is going to be that much more difficult in these conditions.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: The government on Friday indicated that it may curb non-essential imports in the weeks ahead and take steps to boost exports besides announcing a number of measures to shore up the rupee and control the current account deficit.The five steps announced following a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the state of the economy include scrapping withholding tax on masala bonds &mdash; rupee-denominated debt sold overseas &mdash; and relaxations in the overseas debt regime.Modi was briefed by Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel and finance ministry officials, finance minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after the meeting late on Friday.The decisions are aimed at checking the current account deficit (CAD) and increasing foreign exchange inflows, Jaitley said. The government will also take steps to promote exports and restrict non-essential imports, he said.Jaitley said the items on which import restrictions would be imposed will be finalised in consultation with stakeholder ministries and departments to ensure they are in sync with WTO norms.The items most likely to face curbs are gold, mobiles and other electronic items. &ldquo;To address the issue of expanding CAD, the government will take necessary steps to cut down non-essential imports and increase exports,&rdquo; Jaitley said. &ldquo;The commodities of which imports will be cut down will be decided after consultations with concerned ministries and will be WTO-compliant.&rdquo;\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBI and department of economic affairs have suggested more measures and a decision on these will be taken over the next few days.The five steps unveiled to boost capital flows include a review of mandatory hedging conditions for infrastructure loans and permitting manufacturing sector entities to avail of external commercial borrowing up to $50 million with a minimum maturity of one year. Doing away with mandatory hedging for now will reduce demand for dollars.The government also proposed to remove exposure limits of up to 20% of an FPI bond portfolio to a single corporate group, and 50% to a single company. RBI tightened foreign bond purchases in April this year in an attempt to restrict the flow of hot money into Indian markets. Withholding tax on masala bonds will be scrapped for issuances in the current financial year.The rupee closed at its highest in a week at 71.84 against the dollar on Friday in anticipation of measures to rein in the decline, marking a second consecutive day of gains after the Indian currency touched a record intra-day low of 72.90 on Wednesday. The stock market also rallied for a second day with the Sensex reclaiming the 38,000 mark.&ldquo;The moves will help the rupee open stronger on Monday but we need more details on which non-essential items are being considered,&rdquo; said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA.\n  \n\n\n\nFISCAL DEFICITJaitley also pledged to hold the line on the fiscal deficit, pegged at 3.3% of GDP in the current fiscal year. &ldquo;Our growth rate is much higher compared to the global average, inflation is within range.From the finance ministry side, the effort will be to maintain the fiscal deficit and we are confident we will be able to maintain fiscal deficit,&rdquo; he said. Though the economy is strong, external factors were causing nervousness, he said. &ldquo;The areas where we need to become strong are oil and rupee &mdash; we have to fight this challenge,&rdquo; he said, adding that government will look to increase exports and curb nonessential imports. India&rsquo;s current account deficit deteriorated to 1.9% of GDP in FY18 from 0.6% in the year before and is forecast to rise to around 2.8% in the current year. The trade deficit has widened to $80.4 billion in the first five months of the current fiscal from $67.3 billion in the same period last year Amid the turmoil triggered by rising US interest rates, a global trade war that may intensify and strengthening crude prices, the currencies of countries running current account deficits have come under pressure, the Indian rupee included. Economic affairs secretary Subhash Garg said the measures announced on Friday would have an impact of about $8-10 billion dollars.Asked about the prospect of issuing bonds to non-resident Indians to raise dollars, Jaitley said several measures had been discussed but these would be announced as and when a final decision was taken.Some experts felt that these steps may not have too much of an effect given global sentiment. &ldquo;Today we are looking at negative sentiments towards emerging markets and, with all the depreciation, we may not get much water in,&rdquo; said Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank. &ldquo;There is no appetite in global markets, so these measures may not assuage the concerns and do much for the rupee.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Inflation based on wholesale prices eased to a four-month low of 4.53 per cent in August on softening of prices of food articles, especially vegetables.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation stood at 5.09 per cent in July and 3.24 per cent in August last year.According to the government data released Friday, food articles registered deflation at 4.04 per cent in August 2018. Last month, deflation in this category was 2.16 per cent.Deflation in vegetables was 20.18 per cent in August, as against 14.07 per cent in the previous month.Deflationary trend in food articles offset the double-digit inflation in 'fuel and power' basket in August. Inflation in this category was 17.73 per cent as prices of domestic fuel increased during the month, in line with high global crude oil rates.While inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was 46.08 per cent, in diesel and petrol it was 19.90 per cent and 16.30 per cent, respectively, during August.Among food articles, potato inflation continued to rule high at 71.89 per cent in August, while onion and fruits witnessed deflation of 26.80 per cent and 16.40 per cent, respectively.Deflation continued in pulses at 14.23 per cent in August.The 4.53 per cent inflation is the lowest in four months, and a lower inflation than this level was last seen in April at 3.62 per cent.As per the data, the WPI inflation for June was revised downwards to 5.68 per cent from the provisional estimate of 5.77 per cent.Brent crude oil price is hovering at around USD 79 a barrel. This, along with a depreciating rupee has increased the oil import bill, thereby making petrol and diesel costlier.Petrol price Thursday climbed to an all-time high of Rs 81 per litre in Delhi, while in Mumbai it inched up to Rs 88.39. A litre of diesel in the national capital was priced at Rs 73.08 and Rs 77.58 in Mumbai.Data released earlier this week showed retail inflation eased to a 10-month low of 3.69 per cent in August. RBI mainly takes into account retail inflation data while formulating monetary policy.In its third monetary policy review for the fiscal, the Reserve Bank last month hiked interest rate by 0.25 per cent to 6.5 per cent on inflationary concerns.For July-September, RBI pegged CPI-based retail inflation at 4.2 per cent, which it saw firming up to 4.8 per cent in the second half of the current fiscal.",

            "articleBody": " You cannot reduce fiscal deficit without sacrificing growth. So, fiscal deficit needs to come down, monetary policy needs to be tightened and for all that growth needs to come down, Jahangir Aziz, Head, Emerging Market Economies, JPMorgan, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:What is your own assessment of the current macros? Is the rupee weakness more due to global factors or would you say the internal India factors are also at play at this juncture? This is something that we have been flagging for quite some time. If you have an economy in which the fiscal deficit is very large -- central plus state -- running over 7 per cent and could go up even further this year and you have a current account deficit that has moved from 1-2 per cent range in 2016-2017 to 3 per cent now. In a situation like that, two things happen &ndash; bond yields go up and exchange rate depreciates and that is how the economy adjusts. That is more or less what is happening in India. I wonder why people are surprised that this is happening because this is the standard way in which an economy would react when both fiscal deficit and current account deficit are widening.Prime Minister Narendra Modi may hold an economic review this weekend and the government may announce measures on the currency and oil. What kind of measures can one expect to stem the rupee fall given the macros are not as bad as they were way back in 2013? In 2013, basically orthodox steps were taken. Interest rates were raised 300 bps in one day and the government at that time squeezed in almost half a percentage points of fiscal consolidation in a six-month period in a pre-election year. You can search for clever ideas and clever schemes and if you search hard enough, you will find one that will stem the rupee slide, etc. But at the end of the day if the government really wants to address the rupee slide, it needs to address not the symptoms which is the slide but the cause which is the rising fiscal deficit and rising current account deficit. That will require going back to doing what is orthodox which is raising interest rates and cutting fiscal deficit. What is the quantum of monetary tightening that can be expected from the RBI to stem the currency weakness? On the fiscal deficit front, what according to you are the options in hand to get the fisc under control? Will the government have to cut capital spending? At the end of the day, if you have the kind of problem that India faces which is like a broken record over rising fiscal and current account deficits, then the government necessarily has to bite the bullet and accept that it needs to sacrifice growth by cutting fiscal deficit through capital spending or current spending. This is something that the government needs to choose. But fiscal deficit needs to come down, monetary policy needs to be tightened and for all that growth needs to come down. You cannot reduce fiscal deficit without sacrificing any growth. That has never happened. The government has to make the choice. It is difficult to say, how much RBI has to raise rates but I would have guessed that by now, if the RBI was planning to raise rates in October policy meeting, then for it to be more effective, it should have raised the rate by now. Raising it three weeks down the road is less effective than raising it at this point in time. The market conditions will determine the quatum of rate rise but as you have seen in case of Turkey, the rate rise has to be substantial.Given that oil prices have been rising, what room do states and the centre have for cutting the combined fiscal deficit or the central deficit? Is there a risk of cut in capital spending? There is significant room. If the government believes in the growth numbers that the CSO is printing, then at 8.2 per cent, there is almost no justification of having overall fiscal deficit above 7 per cent. There is significant room for fiscal deficit to be brought down. This is something that at some point of time will have to be done. If you push it further down the road, then the amount of adjustment that will be needed will be even larger. But at 8 per cent growth rate, it is very difficult to justify why any country is running a fiscal deficit of around 7 per cent.With the kind of pressure that we are seeing in emerging market currencies, do you see a risk of emerging market crisis emerging that could lead to a broad market contagion given the broad dollar strength?We have seen the broad dollar strength from April to about July. It was more about reassessing developed market monetary policy and repricing how much US and ECB would be raising rates. The question was how will emerging markets react in a world in which the developed market monetary conditions have tightened much more than what people had expected. That&rsquo;s what happened between April and July. In August, it was very different. Investors actually started to reassess emerging market risks by itself and started looking at the current account deficit triggered by what was happening in Turkey and Argentina, The investors figured out or assessed that the risk premium on current account deficit in emerging market countries is significantly higher than what we had thought previously and essentially the investors are demanding a much higher risk premium and emerging market countries so far has not delivered enough amount of assurance that the risk premium will come down.Your firm recently released a report saying that the next crisis could begin very well in 2020. What does India need to do to be a safer haven?The report that you are talking about is based on the probability of recession. We were talking about things beyond the US recession. In 2020, if you look at US recession probability, based on historical models, it is reasonably high. That was the point that was being made. What should India do to prepare for that? India should do what it should have done for the last 10 years which is to react to changing global financial conditions by changing both its fiscal and monetary policy. If you look at India in 2008 and 2011, during the European sovereign debt crisis and in 2013 during taper tantrums, India&rsquo;s policies never really reacted either pre-emptively or even concurrently with changes in global financial conditions. It has always been that global financial shocks or conditions have changed. These have shocked the Indian economy and then India has passively reacted to it. It is time for India to rethink the way it formulates its fiscal and monetary policy so that it is better able to respond to global financial conditions than it has in the past.Should RBI defend the rupee or should policymakers just let the rupee depreciate? Would there be some implications on the Reserve Bank as well?Jahangir Aziz: Over the last two, three weeks, the question in everyone&rsquo;s mind has been whether India should react to the rupee slide, whether RBI should defend it? The question that they should be asking is whether or not India&rsquo;s macro policies, both fiscal and monetary policy should react to changes in global financial conditions? The rupee adjustment or the rupee slide is just a symptom, it is not the cause. The cause remains elsewhere and the cause is that India domestically has a higher fiscal deficit, a higher current account deficit and global monetary conditions have tightened. So the question that needs to be asked is whether or not India should be reacting to tighter monetary conditions and not let tighter monetary conditions shock the economy or create all the adjustments that happens when global monetary conditions hit the economy. Basically, the exchanges start depreciating and then reacting. That is the question that needs to be asked.How happy are you with the current process for the NPA resolution? Does more need to be done or are they taking adequate steps and it is a slow and steady process?The NPA resolution is working with some modest success. It has been a very long drawn process which should have been started and resolved much earlier. The fact that there is bankruptcy law and bankruptcy arrangement has been put into place and we are seeing firms and bankers getting together and restructuring loans is a very good sign. But that process is happening at a significantly slower pace than what the economy will benefit from. These are choices that the government has made. We had been flagging the problem of NPAs becoming a binding constraint to growth back in 2014. Many of the people had said the same thing but the government took its time and this is where we are. ",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: The government is determined to keep fiscal deficit within the budgeted level of 3.3 per cent of GDP as the country cannot afford to have a twin deficit problem, a top official said.The official said a depreciating rupee and high crude import bill would definitely put pressure on the country's current account deficit (CAD), and a fiscal slippage at this juncture would lead to a twin deficit. Ruling out any excise duty cut on petrol and diesel, the official said the dependence on oil as a source of tax revenue has to be brought down and this can only happen when the share of non-oil tax to GDP goes up.  \"India will maintain the fiscal deficit target as we are a consumption driven economy and tax revenues are also increasing. We are determined to do that. We will not cut expenditure as it would have adverse impact on growth,\" the official said.  He said cutting expenditure is the easiest way to trim fiscal deficit. \"If we cut Rs 1 lakh crore in expenditure, it would lower fiscal deficit to 2.9 per cent. But then growth will be impacted,\" the official said.  The government has targeted 3.3 per cent fiscal deficit for the current financial year ending March 2019. The government's finances have shown improvement in July with fiscal deficit at 86.5 per cent of the Budget Estimate (BE), mainly on account of higher revenue collection, as per official data. The deficit was at 92.4 per cent of BE at July-end of the last financial year. \"Income tax revenues are moving in right direction, GST mop up is also recovering and if we keep expenditure within control, we are confident to maintain the fiscal deficit situation. We don't want twin deficit problem,\" the official said. On rupee, which fell to a record low of 72.91 to a dollar in intra-day trade Wednesday, the official said the government is watching the situation and would take appropriate steps as and when required. The current account deficit (CAD), which is the difference between inflow and outflow of foreign exchange, rose to USD 18 billion or 2.4 per cent of GDP in April-June quarter on account widening trade deficit.",

Food Inflation for August came in at 0.29 per cent vs 1.37 per cent in July. Vegetables recorded -7 per cent inflation vs -2.2 per cent recorded in the previous month. A Reuters poll of 40 economists had forecast the inflation easing below the RBI's comfort level of 4 per cent in the medium term.The cooling of inflation below the RBI's comfort level raises the probability that the central bank may not go for another round of rate hike in the next policy review.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI had, in its last policy review, revised upward the inflation projection to 4.8 per cent from 4.7 per cent for the latter half of FY19.The minutes of the MPC meeting highlighted the upside risks to inflation include the hike in minimum support price for Kharif crops, deterioration in monsoon, elevated crude oil prices, and a depreciating rupee.The RBI had cited these as the reason to hike the interest rates for the second time this year. RBI governor Urjit Patel said that the hike was a \"necessary step towards securing the mandated 4 per cent inflation target\".The more than favourable July inflation print was largely on the back of softer food prices.

Today's correction seems to reflect that realisation,\" economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg tweeted. He said there was \"no fundamental rationale\" for the rupee to depreciate to levels seen till Tuesday. \"It reflected overreaction of market operators,\" Garg said.  After crashing to a lifetime low in early trade, the rupee rebounded by 69 paise to trade at 72.00 to the US dollar in late afternoon trade on suspected intervention by the central bank. The currency traded in a range of 71.86 to 72.91 in the day trade.

            "articleBody": " As the Indian rupee plumbs new depths, the currency&rsquo;s overvaluation relative to the nation&rsquo;s trading partners has been used as a justification for the relative inaction from policymakers.There&rsquo;s evidence now to show this argument is weakening. The nation&rsquo;s 36-currency real effective exchange rate, or REER, was 114.54 in August, a two-year low, and down from 115.32 in July, according to data released Tuesday.There are dangers in using the overvaluation argument to not support the rupee when it is hitting multiple lows, said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.&ldquo;Observable rupee shifts have far more impact on the psyche - including market psyche,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And it is hard -- and very expensive -- to catch falling knives once reflexivity sets in.&rdquo;\n  \n\n\n\nThe response of policy makers to the currency&rsquo;s stumble has been rather muted compared with the big interest-rate defense seen in other countries with wide current-account deficits like Indonesia. &ldquo;While the Reserve Bank of India has been intervening in the FX market, the size of recent intervention looks to be less compared to before,&rdquo; Khoon Goh, head of research at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore, said Monday.The RBI net sold $1.9 billion of foreign currency in July to support the rupee, data Tuesday showed. This week&rsquo;s currency selloff, which has nudged the rupee toward 73 per dollar, has led to an increase in chatter on the possible steps likely from the central bank, including raising money from overseas Indians.The depreciation has more or less accounted for the overvaluation seen in the past two-to-three years, according to Kotak Mahindra Bank. The rupee has slid about 15 percent against the dollar from the taper-tantrum period in 2013, significantly less than other big emerging markets, the lender said in a note.&ldquo;On REER basis, the INR remains overvalued against long-term average though it has come down from its highs,&rdquo; economists Suvodeep Rakshit and Upasna Bhardwaj wrote.The rupee is Asia&rsquo;s worst-performing currency this year, and its one-month volatility is at levels last seen in 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show.",

            "articleBody": " MUMBAI: Regulatory policies pose the biggest risks for companies over the next three years, followed by cyber security and technology disruptions, a survey of over 100 top company executives has revealed.The primary reason for this trend is that CXOs are considering regulatory compliance as a critical value protector exercise, the Deloitte India Risk Survey 2018 noted.The survey showed a divide on the viewpoint of risk management amongst Indian organisations.While 44 per cent of businesses harness risks to find future opportunities and drive returns, 36 per cent use risk management with an aim to drive compliance and prevent losses.This insight is further substantiated with the fact that regulatory risk with 44 per cent leads amongst the top three risk areas in the country, followed by cyber security with 31 per cent and technology disruption at 25 per cent, the study said.Interestingly, the report shows that three years from now, there will be an expected shift in the trend.Cyber security will take the lead with 36 per cent amongst the top three risks for businesses, followed by technology disruption risk with 33 per cent and regulatory risks at 31 per cent.The survey was conducted among over 100 top senior executives such as chief executive officers, chief financial officers, chief risk officers, business leaders and heads of internal audit.Also, to get a fair understanding of the risk culture in the Indian organisations, the company gathered responses from organisations belonging to diverse set of industries, both private and public with a turnover of less than Rs 500 crore to Rs 7,500 crore.\"The changing trend demonstrates that with digital transformation, organisation will now need to redefine strategies as they become susceptible to multiple threats emerging through technology disruption,\" said Rohit Mahajan, president, risk advisory, Deloitte India.He further said that the volatility and complexity of each of these risks will continue to increase.\"This essentially means that there needs to be shift from being risk averse to risk aware, with the power of innovation,\" added Mahanjan.The report also stated that with the changing dynamics and the speed of business delivery, there is a growing demand for a dedicated chief risk officer (CRO) position.",

The sharp rupee plunge has increased market chatters of possible interest rate defense or reintroduction of the FCNR deposit scheme and forex swap lines with OMCs,&rdquo; said Madhavi Arora, Economist, FX &amp; Rates- Edelweiss Securities. \nThe relentless slide in the rupee has analysts rushing to rework their forecasts. With the currency setting one record low after another, lenders including DBS Bank are now predicting it will slide to as weak as 75 per dollar, Bloomberg reported today.However, Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that the rupee will not go in for a free fall, as the central bank is appropriately raising interest rate to control inflation.\"It is very important that the RBI continues to signal as it has done so far on its concern about keeping inflation on track, about raising interest rate whenever appropriate, to fulfil its inflation objective ... that gives investors confidence that rupee is not going to go in for free fall because ultimately inflation will be in control ...,\" Rajan said.Meanwhile, media reports have said that the Indian government has asked the RBI to bolster efforts to support the rupee, Asia&rsquo;s worst-performing currency of the past month.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Iraq replaced Saudi Arabia in August as the top oil supplier to India, data from industry and shipping sources showed, as refiners turned to Iraqi barrels to compensate for a lower intake of Iranian oil ahead of U.S. sanctions in November. The United States is reimposing sanctions on Iran following Washington's decision in May to withdraw from a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear programme. While some sanctions were implemented from Aug. 6, those affecting Iran's petroleum sector take effect only from Nov. 4. Imports of Iranian oil by India, Tehran's top oil client after China, fell by about a third to about 523,000 bpd in August from July as state-refiners slowed purchases due to a delay in securing government approval to use Iranian ships. Despite the lower purchases, Iran remained the third biggest oil supplier to India in August, the data showed. Washington will consider waivers for Iranian oil buyers such as India but they must eventually halt imports as sanctions are imposed on Tehran, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday. Iraq and Saudi Arabia continued to be the two biggest oil suppliers to India last month, the tanker arrival data obtained from sources showed. The sources declined to be identified. India refiners shipped in 1.02 million barrels per day (bpd) of Iraqi Basra oil in August, an increase of about 46 percent from the previous month, while imports from Saudi Arabia declined 5 percent to about 747,000 bpd during the period, the data showed. India imported less Nigerian oil in August as the west African nation's output was hit by outages in a couple of major streams such as Bonny Light and Tornados. Also, Asian buyers opted to take light sweet U.S. oil rather than Nigerian. India's imports of U.S. oil in August rose to a record 275,000 bpd, accounting for about 6 percent of its overall purchases, the data showed.  India refiners had booked U.S. oil cargoes in June when discounts between U.S. crude future and Brent was wide enough to make arbitrage economics feasible for India. India's monthly oil imports from Nigeria declined by about 34 percent to about 279,000 bpd, the data showed. Overall India's monthly oil imports in August rose 3.1 percent to about 4.7 million barrels, while they were up 15.8 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Over optimistic bankers, slowdown in government decision making process and moderation in economic growth mainly contributed to the mounting bad loans, said former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan in a note to Parliamentary panel.In a note to Chairman of Estimates Committee Murli Manohar Joshi, he said: \"A variety of governance problems such as the suspect allocation of coal mines coupled with the fear of investigation slowed down government decision making in Delhi, both in the UPA and the subsequent NDA governments\".Project cost overruns escalated for stalled projects and they became increasingly unable to service debt, he said, adding the continuing travails of the stranded power plants, even though India is short of power, suggests government decision making has not picked up sufficient pace to date.He further said a larger number of bad loans were originated in the period 2006-2008 when economic growth was strong, and previous infrastructure projects such as power plants had been completed on time and within budget.\"It is at such times that banks make mistakes. They extrapolate past growth and performance to the future. So, they are willing to accept higher leverage in projects, and less promoter equity. Indeed, sometimes banks signed up to lend based on project reports by the promoter's investment bank, without doing their own due diligence,\" he said.Citing an example, he said \"one promoter told me about how he was pursued then by banks waving chequebooks, asking him to name the amount he wanted\".This is the historic phenomenon of irrational exuberance, common across countries at such a phase in the cycle, he said.Unfortunately, he said, that growth does not always take place as expected and the years of strong global growth before the global financial crisis were followed by a slowdown, which extended even to India, showing how much more integrated the country had become with the world.Strong demand projections for various projects were shown to be increasingly unrealistic as domestic demand slowed down, he said.He also pointed to loss of promoter and banker interest for rise in NPAs.Over malfeasance and corruption in the NPA problem, he said, \"Undoubtedly, there was some, but it is hard to tell banker exuberance, incompetence, and corruption apart\".\"Clearly, bankers were overconfident and probably did too little due diligence for some of these loans. Many did no independent analysis, and placed excessive reliance on SBI Caps and IDBI to do the necessary due diligence. Such outsourcing of analysis is a weakness in the system, and multiplies the possibilities for undue influence,\" the note said.On steps required to prevent recurrence rising non-performing assets (NPAs), Rajan suggested that there is need for improving governance of public sector banks and process of project evaluation and monitoring to lower the risk of project NPAs.Besides, he also made a case for strengthening the recovery process and distance public sector banks from the government.The Parliament's Committee on Estimates had invited Rajan to brief it on the matter after former Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Arvind Subramanian praised him for identifying the NPA crisis and trying to resolve it.Rajan, who was RBI governor for three years till September 2016, is currently the Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at Chicago Booth School of Business.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The weakness in the rupee persisted on Monday, as the domestic currency fell further to settle at a record low of 72.45 against the US dollar. The Indian unit plunged 71 paise or 0.98 per cent on rising crude prices, strengthening dollar and a widening current account deficit. The rupee hit an intraday low 72.67 on Monday, after it breached below the 72.50 mark for the first time against the US dollar earlier in the day.On Friday, the domestic currency had vaulted by 23 paise on heavy Reserve Bank of India intervention.&ldquo;Rupee fell to a fresh record low level against as panic buying by importers triggered further sell-off in the currency. Escalating trade war concerns between the US and China is a still a hanging sword after US President announced that he has tariffs ready to go on $267 billion worth of Chinese imports in addition to the $200 billion of its goods already facing the risk of duties,&rdquo; said Gaurang Somaiya, Currency Analyst, MOFSL. After imposing an import tariff on Chinese goods, US president now has an eye on Japan with whom he looks to take trade issues. Asian, as well as the emerging currencies, continued to remain under pressure and rupee is feeling the contagion effect of the same. The rupee took a further hit as a government data showed that India&rsquo;s CAD widened to $15.8 billion in April-June this year as against $15 billion in the same quarter of 2017-18.&ldquo;We expect that the rupee could continue to feel the pain in the short term and intervention could restrict the pace but bias for the rupee is still negative. Rupee, in the short term, could test levels of 73.20 and break above 72.15 could negate the view for short-term weakness,\" Somaiya added.The FPIs outflows have also hit the rupee hard.Snapping a two-day winning streak, the BSE benchmark Sensex on Monday clocked its biggest point-wise drop since March 16 on foreign fund outflows, which hit Rs 5,600 crore in the last five sessions.&ldquo;The persistent weakness in the rupee is now starting to show its impact on all asset classes including the equities. The sentiment risk is now the major challenge for stock markets. At this time, investors need to be careful and try to get into export-oriented sectors and zero-debt companies as even Indian bond yields have sharply risen to 4-year highs. Indian macros have come under the sharp scrutiny of the market, and we have to see how the government and Reserve Bank of India will deal with the dual challenges of the rupee and bonds,&rdquo; said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior VP and Head of Research - Wealth, Centrum Broking.",

            "articleBody": " Amidst concerns over the rupee depreciation, the market is looking for clear direction on fiscal deficit. Economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg says the government will stay with the target. In an interview with Deepshikha Sikarwar, Garg spoke about the issues faced by the economy. Edited excerpts:The market is looking for a clear direction on the fiscal deficit as far as the rupee and the current account are concerned. Can you assure fiscal prudence in an election year?The government&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability &mdash; fiscal deficit is a very major component of that &mdash; is total. The government is committed. Even if at some stage the oil price burden has to be shifted, something would be done to ensure that the fiscal deficit is not breached.One of the worries about rupee depreciation is its impact on external commercial borrowings. How do you see the situation?These borrowers should continue to have the faith that rupee is not there for any significant depreciation and therefore they need not be feeling any nervousness about it. That would in fact help them also in that if there is no excessive hedging or forward buying, the rupee would stabilise quickly.Also, it is only against the dollar that the rupee is depreciating &mdash; (against) all other currencies it is not. If their liabilities are in other currencies, then there is nothing to worry. The evidence on Friday &mdash;I am told $300 million came into index funds &mdash; suggests even market participants believe it has reached the maximum possible and there should now be a good flow inward.On the one hand, we are raising duties to encourage Make in India but at the same time we are entering into trade agreements like RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) where we have to open up the market, including to China. Is there not a dichotomy here?Our general direction is to open up more and more and become part of the global value chain. However, we have several areas where India should rightly be manufacturing more. We import close to $50 billion of electronics. This is something we can make. Our policy on Make in India on mobiles has helped quite a bit. We are at one stage of manufacturing and we will go to the next stage of manufacturing soon and this big import bill which is there can be taken care of. Twenty to 25 years back we hardly had any automobile manufacturing capacity.Today, we are the third biggest producer. So, the right kind of trade policy calibrated to your specific requirement in certain sectors can give a big boost to manufacturing while generally the trend towards opening &mdash; in RCEP or WTO or elsewhere &mdash; is something we need. I think both these things are reconcilable.On RCEP there are concerns over China.If we move further on RCEP, we will need to take measures which will take care of the China question. So, movement on RCEP is subject to our having a solution on our concern with China.When the National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) was set up, one of the ideas was to have a stressed asset fund. There are some good stressed power assets up for resolution. Will NIIF participate?Of course, the mandate of the master fund set up by the NIIF and also on the strategic fund is to look at the opportunity in the stressed assets market &mdash; whether those are power assets, road assets or other infrastructure assets. But NIIF is to make investment only if those assets can be turned around and can generate profits. NIIF is not in the business of lending or in the business of making investments which are not likely to become profitable. NIIF&rsquo;s investment committee keeps on looking at these assets and will take a call whenever an opportunity arises.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has issued a circular on foreign portfolio investors. Is the department of economic affairs convinced about it?This was a bit unfortunate the way it turned out &mdash; some passions got raised. That should have been avoided. Essentially the issue is this&mdash;NRIs (nonresident Indians) have several avenues of investing in India. However, FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) does not distinguish between NRIs owning and managing FPIs and non-NRIs owning and managing FPIs. So, the emotional argument made was that a Nigerian can own and run an FPI but an NRI cannot.Sebi, the regulator of FPIs, based on some of the episodes in the past, has been cautious. There have been some concerns, some episodes where the NRI route has been misused &mdash; that was the genesis of the circular. There is merit in the argument the NRI-FPI community is advancing that we have moved away quite a lot from the past, transparency has improved and beneficial ownerships can be disclosed and monitored.We need to look at this entire thing in an open and fresh manner. Sebi is coming out with a discussion paper outlining all this and inviting views. Very soon, a call can be taken on the best way forward, which will be built around bringing as much equality of treatment between NRIs and non-NRIs, at the same time ensuring that money laundering concerns are fully addressed.The telecom ministry is not very keen on auctions looking at industry and sentiment but we have revenue estimated in the budget&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think there is this sense that telecom is not keen on auctioning. The broad framework is that there is certain spectrum which are amenable to auction. The telecom department is looking to identify auctionable spectrum and then come out with a policy. We have our revenue targets&mdash;we would like those to be delivered, otherwise we have another little hole to take care of.There is a view that with rupee depreciation, interest rates may need to be raised. What do you think?Bond yields have already risen, so interest rates are already higher to some extent. That also I suppose will cool down once the situation on the rupee improves.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Sustained weakening of the rupee is \"credit negative\" for Indian companies which generate revenue in rupees but rely on US dollar debt to fund their operations, Moody's Investors Service said Monday. The Indian rupee has depreciated 13 per cent so far in 2018 and has touched a historic low of Rs 72.32 to a dollar.  \"Nevertheless, most rated India-based corporates have protections in place -- including natural hedges, some US dollar revenues and financial hedges -- to limit the negative credit implications of a potential further 10 per cent weakening of the rupee to the US dollar from Thursday's (September 6) rate (of 72.11 a dollar),\" Moody's VP and Senior credit officer Annalisa DiChiara said.  Of the 24 Moody's-rated India-based corporates across the high-yield and investment grade categories, 12 generate most of their revenue in US dollars or have contracts priced in US dollars, providing a natural hedge, and thus limiting the effect a weakening in the rupee could have on their cash flows, it said.  These 24 corporates include those in the IT, oil and gas, chemicals, automobiles, commodities, steel, and real estate development sectors.  \"A sustained weakening of the rupee would be credit negative for its rated Indian companies, particularly those that generate revenue in rupees but rely on US dollar debt to fund their operations and have significant dollar-based costs, including capital expenses,\" Moody's said.",

            "articleBody": " BENGALURU : India's inflation likely eased below the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target in August on softer food prices, a Reuters poll showed, raising the probability the central bank will keep interest rates on hold at its next rate review. The poll of nearly 40 economists conducted from Sept. 4-7 predicted retail inflation eased to 3.86 per cent from July's 4.17 per cent, below the RBI's 4 per cent target for the first time this year.  While nearly three quarters of contributors expected inflation fell below target, two economists expected it to be at 4 per cent and the remaining nine said it would be above target. The highest call was 5.4 per cent.  Inflation data is due to be published on Sept. 12 at 1200 GMT. Still, core inflation which excludes highly volatile food and fuel components, was expected to remain elevated. \"Headline consumer price inflation is likely to have eased in August due to another fall in food inflation,\" noted Shilan Shah, a senior Indian economist at Capital Economics. \"But core price pressures are set to remain elevated. The upshot is that the RBI's tightening cycle still has a little bit further to run.\"  If those forecasts come true, it would give the RBI a breather after it raised rates in its previous two meetings, taking borrowing costs to a four-year high of 6.50 per cent to tame speeding inflation. However, this could be temporary as a weakening rupee and rising crude oil prices would boost consumer prices. While oil prices have risen nearly 15 per cent this year, the rupee touched an all-time low of 72 per dollar on Thursday and was expected to hover near there on a worsening trade balance. \"For the RBI, the policy path is likely to get challenging as inflation is slowing at a time when market volatility is high, and the rupee is at a record low versus the US dollar,\" wrote Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS Bank. \"If the rupee remains under pressure, the central bank might be forced to hike rates citing risks to inflationary expectations.\" India's GDP growth rate reached 8.2 per cent last quarter and the diverging paths of growth and inflation could concern RBI policymakers. The poll forecast industrial output would expand 6.6 per cent in July compared with June's 7.0 per cent. WPI inflation probably inched down to 4.7 per cent in August from 5.1 per cent, the poll said.

The state government had introduced the industry policy in 2013, which after its expiry in March 2018, was extended for another six months. The draft has finally been chalked out and will be published to include the suggestion of industries. In June this year, state industries minister Subhash Desai had interacted with the local industries here on the new industrial policy of the state. During his visit to Nashik, Desai had said that apart from attracting new investments, the major focus would be on generating more employments in the state and making &lsquo;ease of doing business&rsquo; more effective.&ldquo;We have already given our suggestions to the department of industries on the new industrial policy,&rdquo; said NIMA president Harishankar Banerjee. Industrial associations have given suggestions like speeding up new industrial estates in a time-bound manner, ban on workers unions involving crime cases, Factory Act to be applied to industrial units having more than 50 workers, separate industrial township, incentives for the industries using solar energy, effective implementation of the ease of doing business, uniform power tariff across the state, revision of zoning of industrial estates based on GDP growth and a host of other issues.Moreover, industrial associations had also demanded of taking some measures or giving some incentives to boost the grape wine industry in the state.&ldquo;The grape processing policy of the state had been introduced in 2001 but the wine policy has not yet been revised. There are various issues related to grape wine that are pending with the state excise and development commissioner for the many years,&rdquo; said president of Nashik District Industries &amp; Exporters&rsquo; Association Ramesh Pawar adding that this was the most conducive time to give an impetus to the grape wine sector in the state.

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui MUMBAI: India's current account deficit (CAD) as a percentage of GDP declined marginally to 2.4 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2018-19 against 2.5 per cent in the year-ago period, the RBI data released Friday showed.In value terms, the CAD was higher at $15.8 billion in April-June this year as against $15 billion in the same quarter of 2017-18 mainly due to a higher trade deficit.\"India's current account deficit (CAD) stood at $15.8 billion (2.4 per cent of GDP) in Q1 of 2018-19 as compared with $15 billion (2.5 per cent of GDP) in Q1 of 2017-18,\" the RBI said on Developments in India's Balance of Payments (BoP).The Indian currency is declining against the US dollar due to global factors as well as concerns on higher trade deficit on account of sustained high crude oil prices.According to the data, net services receipts increased by 2.1 per cent year-on-year mainly on the back of a rise in net earnings from software and financial services.\"Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, amounted to $18.8 billion, increasing by 16.9 per cent from their level a year ago,\" the central bank said.The data on BoP also revealed that net foreign direct investment at $9.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018-19 was higher than $7.1 billion in the year-ago period. However, portfolio investment recorded net outflow of $8.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018-19 as compared with an inflow of $12.5 billion in the year-ago period &ndash; on account of net sales in both the debt and equity markets, the RBI added.Net receipts on account of non-resident deposits amounted to $3.5 billion in April-June, 2018-19, as compared with $1.2 billion a year ago. There was a depletion of $11.3 billion of the foreign exchange reserves (on BoP basis) in the first quarter as against an accretion of $11.4 billion in the year-ago period. ",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: It has been a rough year for emerging markets. The US dollar has been strengthening and bonds have taken a hit. A strong dollar is excellent for the US economy as it attracts capital into the country. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s a nightmare for emerging markets because investors take that capital away and send it back to the US. This is what is happening right now to our Indian rupee and other emerging market currencies like lira, rand, peso and the like.\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nHere, we can see that while the dollar index is up by 3.43 per cent, an emerging market currency index is down by more than 5.5 per cent, which clearly states that EM currencies are underperforming more than a strengthening dollar. While the rupee is getting hurt by rising oil prices, the dollar is strengthening as emerging currencies are selling off. Argentina peso last week suffered a sharp fall and Turkey&rsquo;s lira is also witnessing a selloff. The dollar was under pressure at the start of the week as trade conflicts were easing because of the US-Mexico deal. Canada may also come on board this week, but the bigger trade conflict would be with China which is not likely to be over soon. This again has given much needed fuel to the Dollar and we saw the greenback strengthening at the end of the week. Global risk assets should remain under stress due to the ongoing potent mix of emerging markets spillover amid concerns that President Donald Trump may move forward this week with the next round of tariffs directed at China&rsquo;s $200 billion goods. The market will be volatile as traders will be second guessing whether tariffs will be implemented or extension will be offered.Investors are also focusing on EM FX pairs as various central banks are taking action to address their currency fall. Brazil&rsquo;s central bank has started forex intervention. Argentina central banks have raised their interest rate by a whopping 15% from 45% to 60% to stop the slide in the currency. Indonesia&rsquo;s central bank is also intervening in its bonds and currency markets to stop the volatility. Turkey has taken steps to withhold tax relating to lira&rsquo;s deposit and taxing on dollar currency deposit. Fortunately, RBI intervention is very light in the market and that is positive as it is letting market decide the desired level for the rupee instead of depleting foreign exchange reserves.Brent crude prices have remained supported by the notion that US sanctions on Iran will lead to supply constraints. OPEC producers are dragging their feet on raising production. So, it is likely that we will see a jump in crude oil prices. This is negative for our currency as we can see that crude oil plays a heavy role in currency trend rather than the dollar.\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSo, don&rsquo;t expect any relief in our currency till crude oil prices come down. Moreover, our currency is susceptible to a fall because of EM forex breakdown. We are anticipating prices till 72.40 per dollar and above before we may see some pullback. Till then, it is a dark road for our currency.(The writer is Senior Technical Analyst, Tradebulls Securities)",

            "articleBody": " BENGALURU: The Centre is planning to slash the number of GST rate slabs from the present five to two in the near future, according to AK Jyotishi, Principal Chief Commissioner of Central Taxes, Bengaluru Zone.The thinking is guided by the fact that 90 per cent of the taxes come under the 18 per cent rate slab, he said, delivering the inaugural address at Workshop on GST: Practical Requirements and Challenges organised by Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC) today.Since the launch of GST, the government has cleared a lot of misconception among tax payers about the new indirect tax law. &ldquo;GST is not a disruptive law but a transformational law. As the law is maturing, the industry, which initially had inhibitions and doubts is now voluntarily complying with the law,\" he said. \"We do accept the fact that, GST initially had several glitches and had created complexity in complying with it, but now a sizable chuck of the hitches stands removed.&rdquo;The Principal Chief Commissioner said by a word of caution: &ldquo;There is an impression that tax assessees can get away by not complying with GST law in the garb that the Department is still using manual methods. But let me flag you, after the initial handholding and a go-slow attitude, which was deliberate, we now have all the wherewithal to track tax defaulters and will act with a stern hand, if tax payers continue to default.&rdquo; The government is using data analytics and the defaults have already been detected, he said. Explaining how simple and plain the GST law is Jyothishi cited an example of a credit card seller and how he forced him to buy the card despite his strong reservation. &ldquo;After initial no-no, I was coaxed to take the credit card. After reaping the benefits of the Credit Card, I was overwhelmed by the benefits and the ease of transaction. Similarly, GST may look complex initially, but let me tell you that once you begin to adapt to the new law, operations will be as simple as sending an SMS to the Department,&rdquo; he said.Mr. Jyothishi said that as per current records there are 8 lakh assessees (3.4 lakh Central Government monitored and the rest by the State). The Department collects on an average Rs. 6,500 crores every month. The Tax base has increased from 60 lakh crores to 1.10 crores. Basically, the increase is due to voluntary compliance and also some sectors, hitherto left out, have now come under the GST gambit.BCIC president Kishore Alva said despite a few drawbacks the industry is facing due to the new tax legislation, the business community must celebrate the landmark reform.\" At the same time, we also must acknowledge that it is only half the job done, as far as tax reform is concerned. We have a long way to go.&rdquo;",

According to media reports the Reserve Bank of India might have sold dollars in the morning session to prevent rupee from falling towards 72 level.However, the rupee was trading 29 paise down at 72.05 at around 12.45 pm (IST).Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI said that the rupee depreciation of 13 per cent in 2018 and around 7 per cent since June 2018 when the RBI started hiking rates is largely in consonance will dollar strengthening against all currencies.&ldquo;The rupee could not have been immune to such and hence the current depreciation was long overdue and trends in NDF market (rupee at 75 and implied 1 year yield at 7.7 per cent) suggest the pain might not be just over yet!&rdquo;Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday attributed the fall in rupee to global factors and said there was no need for panic or knee-jerk reactions.

US trade representative (USTR) for south and central Asian affairs Mark Linscott and deputy USTR Jeffrey D Gerrish are likely to visit India next week to continue the talks.High on the agenda are the penal duties imposed by the US on Indian steel and aluminium on ground of security concerns, and continuation of preferential benefits to Indian exports under US Generalised System of Preferences.On the US concerns over its trade deficit with India, New Delhi has said it can&rsquo;t commit to the amount by which it can reduce this gap.&ldquo;Both countries have limited ability to commit a trade value for future years as most trade would be by private parties,&rdquo; said a commerce department official. &ldquo;We are engaged in talks to find out a mutually satisfactory solution.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India&rsquo;s rupee owes its tag of Asia&rsquo;s worst-performing currency this year to the selloff sweeping emerging markets. There&rsquo;s more pain in store from beyond its borders.While foreign currency debt has zoomed, various external vulnerability indicators paint a rather mixed picture, according to the Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s annual report. Indeed, data due as early as next week will probably show the nation&rsquo;s current-account deficit widened in the June quarter to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, the highest in 4 1/2 years.The widening in the gap is the weakest spot for Asia&rsquo;s third-largest economy and one of the reasons why the rupee has been among the worst-hit in Asia this year. The currency dropped to a record 71.7575 per dollar on Wednesday.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sliding rupee and expectations of a faster-than-anticipated pace of monetary tightening by the U.S. Fed saw more than $3 billion of foreign portfolio investments moving out in the April-June period. Elevated oil prices and the trade tensions between the U.S. and China contributed to the outflows.Analysts at Nomura Holdings Inc. said India&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves at $401 billion are enough to cover eight months of imports. They are also at about 1.8 times India&rsquo;s short-term external debt, but down from nearly three times in 2008.&ldquo;Oil imports continue to pose a challenge to the trade deficit. Non-oil imports also remain high,&rdquo; said Shashank Mendiratta, an economist with ANZ Banking Group in Bengaluru. &ldquo;We are looking at 2.7 percent of GDP,&rdquo; he said, referring to the current-account gap.Some analysts including those at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Commerzbank AG are expecting the RBI to raise borrowing costs sooner than later to shore up the currency. The central bank raised rates twice this year and is due to review policy in the first week of October.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;Strengthening of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals holds the key to ensuring a viable external sector that is reasonably buffered against global shocks,&rdquo; the RBI said.",

            "articleBody": "A man checks his phone outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai, India April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo New Delhi: India probably overestimated manufacturing output while calculating economic growth that topped 8 per cent in the June quarter, according to a member of the central bank&rsquo;s rate-setting panel.The new gross domestic product series has mostly replaced the Annual Survey of Industries with corporate financial data for estimating manufacturing value added, according to an article Ravindra Dholakia, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, co-authored with R. Nagaraj and Manish Pandya in the latest edition of the Economic and Political Weekly. This has resulted in its higher share in GDP and a faster growth rate compared to the older series, they said.Statistics ministry data on Friday showed manufacturing sector expanded 13.5 per cent in the three months to June, driving the broader economic growth by 8.2 per cent -- the fastest pace for any major economy. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley attributed the economy&rsquo;s performance to the government&rsquo;s reforms and fiscal prudence amid uncertainty spawned by the trade spat between the US and China.&ldquo;Does the new series represent a fuller description of the manufacturing value added, or is it an overestimation?&rdquo; the authors wrote.Higher manufacturing growth rate gives &ldquo;rise to serious doubts about the veracity of new estimates&rdquo; and is at &ldquo;variance with other macroeconomic correlates,&rdquo; wrote Dholakia, an external member on the monetary policy committee and a management professor.The Reserve Bank of India has maintained its full-year growth forecast at 7.4 per cent, while flagging risks from high oil prices and trade tensions turning into a currency war. The central bank increased policy rates twice since June to curb inflationary pressures.Dholakia has been advocating lower interest rates to support growth and was the only member to oppose a rate increase at the August meeting.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: The rupee on Tuesday closed at another fresh record low of 71.57 against dollar, falling 36 paise against its previous close of 71.21 against the US currency.Market experts believe that besides strong demand for the US dollar from importers, capital outflows too weighed on the domestic currency.Gaurang Somaiya, Currency Analyst- Commodities, MOFSL said, &ldquo;Rupee fell to fresh record low levels despite weakness in the dollar against its major crosses, but the major trigger this time came in from underlying dollar demand from oil marketing companies and defense related buying for the government. Selling in the rupee was witnessed at the end of the month, taking the depreciation to the extent of over 10% for this year (YTD).&rdquo;Mahesh Singhi, Founder &amp; MD, Singhi Advisors said, &ldquo;Over the last few months, the US dollar has been rapidly trending a rising growth trajectory. The US greenback has been exerting severe pressure on the Indian rupee, negating of its cost competitiveness in the global markets. The unrelenting slide in the domestic currency has adversely impacted the operational margins of importers,&rdquo;The recent economic numbers released from India suggest that the economy is not in a bad state, but global factors could continue to keep the currency under pressure. Data released by Ministry of statistics showed the economy in Q1 grew at a pace of 8.2 per cent compared to previous quarter growth of 7.6 per cent. On the other hand, fiscal deficit for April-July stood at Rs 5.04trillion or 86.5 per cent of the budget. Meanwhile exceeded the budget estimates for revenue deficit by 6.3 per cent in the first four months of FY&rsquo;19. However, this was lower than 31.2 per cent in a year ago period. &ldquo;This month, rupee could continue to trade with high volatility, and with emerging market currencies like Mexican Peso and Turkish Lira having fallen sharply against the US dollar, gains for the rupee could be restricted. In the near future, market participants will also be keenly keeping an eye on Brent crude prices that rallied by over 15 per cent (YTD) and which could further inflate India&rsquo;s import bill. We expect the rupee to remain under pressure and test levels of 72 in the near term and on the higher side 70.30 will be an important resistance,&rdquo; said Singhi.Though the rupee has not performed as badly as emerging market economies like the Turkish Lira or Argentine Peso, its rapid downslide has the potential to create significant headwinds for the Indian economy, he added.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nNEW DELHI: India's growth rate is expected to moderate this fiscal despite a strong start in the April-June quarter largely owing to tighter financial conditions, limited fiscal headroom and upcoming elections, says a DBS report.  \"We doubt that India can sustain a growth trajectory above 8 per cent for the rest of this fiscal,\" DBS said in a research note, adding that \"We expect FY19 growth to moderate to 7.4 per cent this year\".  According to the global financial services major, dissipating base effects, tighter financial conditions and limited fiscal headroom will come together to moderate growth this fiscal.  The report further noted that upcoming elections (states and general polls) also add to the uncertainties for the investment community.  Externally, higher oil prices and signs of a cyclical slowdown globally due to trade frictions, point towards a tougher environment. These are likely to offset any potential benefits from a weaker currency.  According to official data, the Indian economy grew at a two-year high of 8.2 per cent in the April-June quarter of current fiscal on good show by manufacturing and farm sectors.  On the policy front, the report said there is room for another rate hike this fiscal.  \"Strong growth conditions provide room for the RBI to defend core inflationary pressures and market volatility through further policy tightening,\" the report said, adding that the firm retains its \"call for another hike in FY19\".  In its August policy review, RBI raised benchmark short-term lending rate (repo) by 25 basis points to 6.5 per cent citing inflationary concerns. It was the second such hike in a row.",

            "articleBody": " Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India's role during the recent rupee slide may be questioned as to why it allowed a steep fall, but bankers say that the central bank has been active with constant oral intervention with dealing rooms. It has assessed the reasons behind the fall which helped it conclude that there was no severe panic, but genuine trade related transactions that drove the rupee down, multiple bankers told ET on condition of anonymity. The rupee Monday hit another record low at 71.21 a dollar amid overseas fund outflows, losing 0.31 per cent from Friday.An email sent to RBI remained unanswered until the publication of this report.&ldquo;The central bank is also keen to understand if any bank is taking any wild speculative bet, which could exert more pressure on the rupee,&rdquo; said one of the persons cited above.Earlier in 2013 when the rupee had hit a record low, some corporates/banks were seen short-selling the rupee aiding its further fall, a move aimed at sheer trading profits.Moreover, the custodian banks, which transact on behalf of their clients: foreign portfolio investors were under the watchful eyes with the RBI checking daily dollars outflow levels. Some large banks are said to be receiving about five-six calls daily from the regulator.The rupee has been touching record lows in the past two weeks. Last Friday, it hit record low at 71 a dollar amid weakness in emerging markets, sparked off by the Argentine and Turkey currency collapses.Traders could spot only intermittent interventions barring a few occasions.Whenever the rupee has inched closer to 71, a psychological level or even touched it, some state-owned banks are seen selling dollars, supposedly on behalf of the central bank.The RBI intervention becomes only effective when there is no large outflows from India.&ldquo;It would have created arbitrage opportunities if RBI forcefully resists rupee&rsquo;s rout when there are overseas investment outflows,&rdquo; said a currency dealer.RBI has too stepped up intervention when the rupee plunged as a one-off case, not in sync with majority of emerging market currencies.For example, last week global investors turned jittery on emerging market currencies particularly with large current account deficit, excess of overseas spending over revenues. Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee were too immediately victims in the wake of rising crude oil prices. Both lost quick values to the dollar.On August 14 and 15, when the rupee crossed the then crucial mark of 70/$, the RBI was suspected to have defended the level as other peer currencies did not fall. Instead, Turkish lira showed some signs of correction.While the central bank&rsquo;s stated position has been that it would step in to curb volatility, the RBI was conspicuous by its &lsquo;hands-off&rsquo; approach on days the rupee fell precipitously.&ldquo;This time RBI&rsquo;s intervention was in stark contrast compared with 2013 as the RBI appears to be keen in reducing RBI&rsquo;s overvaluation now,&rdquo; said another head of trading from a large currency desk.According to the 36-currency RBI Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), the rupee is overvalued 15 per cent. The six currency REER gauge shows a 23 per cent overvaluation for the local unit.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The rupee continued with its downward trend, as the currency slipped 22 paise on Monday to close at a fresg all-time low of 71.21.The rupee closed below the 71 mark for the first time ever following weak trend in emerging market currencies and rising crude oil prices.The local currency settled the day at 71.21 against dollar, down 22 paise against its previous close.The Dollar index has climbed nearly 4 per cent on a year-to-date basis, whereas rupee has fallen more than 10 per cent during January 1-September 3, 2018. Rising tension over US-China trade war and contagion risks from Turkey and Argentina are other factors, which impacted forex market sentiment. Oil prices climbed to over $78 a barrel on concerns that falling Iranian output will tighten markets once US sanctions bite from November.Selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPI) is also a cause of concern for Indian market. On a net basis, FPIs offloaded shares worth Rs 2,12.81 crore on Friday, as per provisional data.Earlier, the benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty also plunged nearly 0.85 per cent following subdued global cues. On the global front, Turkey&rsquo;s lira led emerging currency losses on Monday after inflation spiked to almost 18 per cent in August, while the Indonesian rupiah fell to its lowest level since the Asian financial crisis.The lira was down 1.5 per cent after Turkish consumer price inflation rose to a near 15-year high of 17.9 percent in August, up 2.3 per cent month-on-month. Producer prices leapt 32.13 per cent.",

            "articleBody": "A man checks his phone outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai, India June 7, 2017. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/File Photo New Delhi: A sustained weakness in the rupee may push the Reserve Bank of India to further tighten monetary policy, perhaps as early as next month, JPMorgan Chase and Co.&rsquo;s chief India economist Sajjid Chinoy said.&ldquo;The RBI meeting becomes an interesting dilemma,&rdquo; Chinoy told Bloomberg Television in an interview on Monday, adding that after two interest rate hikes since June, he, like most in the market, thought the central bank had bought time before the next increase. At the same time, inflation is easing, with headline numbers for August likely to show that the consumer price index rose by less than 4 per cent from a year ago, he said.That easing will bring inflation in line with the central bank&rsquo;s aim of keeping it at the 4 per cent midpoint of its target band. After delivering back-to-back rate hikes to cool price pressures in the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing major economy, Governor Urjit Patel said there was a rising threat from global trade wars, with potential implications for investment and exports. This led many to believe the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee will switch to a wait-and-watch mode in coming months.But the rupee&rsquo;s rapid fall in August might force the RBI&rsquo;s hand sooner, Chinoy said. The Indian currency lost 3.5 per cent last month and is the worst performer in Asia so far this year, mainly due to worries about a widening current-account deficit. The MPC is scheduled to announce its next decision on Oct. 5.&ldquo;The joker in the pack is the currency,&rdquo; Chinoy said. &ldquo;We have seen all emerging market current account-deficit countries come under pressure in the last two months despite a weaker dollar index. And if that continues and the RBI is losing reserves at the rapid pace, then the October meeting very much comes into play and the strong GDP print enables that.&rdquo;India&rsquo;s gross domestic product grew 8.2 per cent from a year earlier in the three months ended June, the Statistics Ministry said in a statement on Friday, beating the 7.6 per cent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists.",

A reading of over 50 on this survey-based index indicates expansion, below that contraction.&ldquo;August data signalled a further loss of growth momentum across India&rsquo;s manufacturing sector, reflecting slower gains in output and new orders,&rdquo; said Aashna Dodhia, Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.Official data released Friday showed that India's economy expanded 8.2% in the April-June quarter, its fastest pace in more than two years, driven by solid growth in manufacturing and consumer spending.&ldquo;Indeed, some of the key headwinds facing the economy include high global oil prices, monetary policy tightening, and capital outflows from emerging markets,&rdquo; Dodhia added.As per the survey, Indian manufacturing companies retained optimistic projections for output in the next 12 months. That said, the level of sentiment eased from July&rsquo;s three- month high and remained below the historical average.",

            "articleBody": " MUMBAI: The rupee may slump to 73 to a dollar by December if emerging market (EM) currencies collectively head south in their response to the steady and unidirectional gains for the US unit, pointing to a period of sustained volatility in the foreign-exchange market.An exclusive ET survey, which polled 20 market participants, showed that more than half the respondents expect 73 to be the lower limit for the local unit this calendar year. One of the participants believes the rupee could slide to 74 to a dollar.&ldquo;If the situation in emerging markets continues to deteriorate in the face of a strengthening dollar, the contagion will spread, weighing on the rupee as well,&rdquo; said Ashish Vaidya, head of markets for India at Singapore&rsquo;s DBS Bank. &ldquo;As long as oil keeps rising, the local unit will remain under pressure.&rdquo;To be sure, India&rsquo;s domestic-focused economy has continued to outperform peers, with gross domestic product (GDP) expanding at 8.2 per cent in the June quarter &ndash; the fastest pace in a couple of years. Still, currency-market volatility and rising global interest in safe-haven assets could outweigh broader growth in the short run.&ldquo;With a risk-off sentiment in Emerging Markets, positive growth figures may not&rdquo; immediately get the treatment they deserve, Vaidya said.Separately, crude oil price climbed nearly 10 per cent in the past fortnight amid tighter global inventories that are tied to US sanctions on Iran. India is one of the major oil importing countries, meeting three-fourths of its requirement through overseas shipments.&ldquo;Emerging market weaknesses and elevated oil prices are now dictating the rupee&rsquo;s rout,&rdquo; said Piyush Wadhwa, head of trading at IDFC Bank. &ldquo;The rupee would move with a slightly depreciating bias as countries with wider current account deficit are hit the most.&rdquo;&ldquo;Currency traders should brace for increased volatility as market conditions could change frequently with evolving global developments,&rdquo; he said.Currency crashes in Argentina and Turkey have triggered concerns of a global contagion, with renewed worries over the USChina trade war. The Argentine peso and Turkish lira have slumped 52 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, against the dollar this year.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia&rsquo;s rupiah hit its lowest level in two decades, signaling that currency collapses are clouding the economic prospects of countries with higher trade deficits, or excess of overseas spending over revenue.A rise in import bill worsens the country&rsquo;s fiscal condition, prompting the government to borrow more. This, in turn, punctures global investor confidence as higher borrowing runs contrary to expected fiscal rectitude.India&rsquo;s current account deficit is expected to widen to 2.8 per cent of the GDP this financial year, up from 1.9 per cent last year, according to a Nomura Research report.Investments in stressed assets could negate some of the negative impact on the currency.&ldquo;Overseas investors could invest in stressed assets,&rdquo; said Ashutosh Khajuria, executive director and CFO of Federal Bank.India&rsquo;s proposed asset management companies to run bad assets could attract billions of dollars in overseas cash, show some market estimates.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India's economy grew at an impressive 8.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2018-19 financial year ending June 30 on the back of a strong core performance and a healthy base .This jump ahead of national elections next year would help bolster the government amid a debate over its economic record versus that of its predecessor following the release of back-series data recently. The Indian government changed the base year for GDP calculation from 2004-05 to 2011-12, by changing the goods and services in the basket to make it more current, in 2015.The official figures are much better than the expectations of economists who have predicted about 7.5-7.6 per cent Q1 growth. As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India's economic growth is expected to accelerate to 7.4 per cent in the current fiscal year that began in April, from 6.7 per cent the previous one, despite risks posed by higher oil prices and global trade tensions.The world&rsquo;s second largest economy, China, reported a 6.7 per cent growth for June quarter compared with 6.8 per cent in March quarter. India's $2.6 trillion economy surpassed France's in 2017 to be the world's sixth largest, and it was not far before the United Kingdom, according to World Bank data.However despite the strong Q1 numbers, there is apprehension about the economy slowing down in the coming times. Sameer Narang, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, told Reuters that the economic growth could cool to about 7.2 per cent in October-March.The Reserve Bank of India has raised its benchmark repo rate by a total of 50 basis points at its past two meetings, to 6.5 per cent, to tame inflation that has remained above its medium-term target of 4 per cent for the last nine months.In July, retail inflation eased to 4.17 per cent from a year earlier, but is projected to remain around 4.8 per cent in the second half of the fiscal year.The rupee has weakened nearly 10 per cent against the dollar this year, touching a record low of 71 to the dollar on Thursday, and is the worst performing currency in Asia.Credit ratings agency Moody's has warned about rising pressure of higher oil prices and interest rates on government finances and India's current account.Earlier today, government data showed a fiscal deficit of Rs 5.40 lakh crore for April-July, or 86.5 per cent of the budgeted target for the current fiscal year compared with 92.4 per cent a year earlier.

Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said there are risks of India breaching that target for the current financial year as higher oil prices will add to short-term fiscal pressures. According to the US-based agency, the current account deficit (CAD), which is the difference between inflow and outflow of foreign currency, will widen but will not jeopardise India's external position; and the gap will remain significantly narrower than five years ago. \"Higher oil prices add to short-term fiscal pressures, following cuts in the goods and services tax on some items and relatively high increases in minimum support prices for some crops. We see risks that the deficit will be wider than budgeted,\" Moody's said. Brent crude futures is currently hovering around USD 76.51 a barrel. ",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Hedging works in currency only till a point. The rupee&rsquo;s recent fall, which has left it at levels never seen before, has put additional pressure on the promoters of companies that have large external commercial borrowings (ECB), some of which are maturing in the near term.ACE Equity data showed outstanding ECB debts worth $1.90 billion of some 60 companies are going to mature over next six months. The rupee on Friday slumped to a fresh record low of 71 against the dollar for the first time ever on persistent demand for the US currency amid rising oil prices.Rupee has fallen nearly 10 per cent against dollar and 8 per cent against Euro this year so far and also slipped 7 per cent against pound during January 1-August 31.Motherson Sumi, NRB Industrial Bearings, Simplex Infrastructure, Asahi India Glass, TVS Srichakra, Sundaram Fasteners, Steel Authority of India and 63 Moons Technologies are among the companies whose ECB debt is falling due in next three months.Every dip in the rupee is going put additional pressure on companies having ECB exposure. &ldquo;Any entity that is staring at repayment of debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies, especially in USD, is staring at very difficult times, unless it has a natural or calculated hedge through exports or something,&rdquo; said Prakash Diwan, Market Expert at prakashdiwan.in.Overall, ECBs of 60 companies are set to mature in next six months. Of these, 37 will mature by December 2018 and the rest by March 2019.The largest ECB of Sterling Biotech worth $206.50 million is set to mature in March 2019. BASF India ($185 million), Steel Authority of India ($150 million), Dr Reddy&rsquo;s Laboratories ($150 million) have ECBs maturing on January 31, 2019, November 30, 2018 and January 31, 2019, respectively, Ace Equity data showed.On the impact of the rupee fall on companies, Chetan Phalke, founder and research head at Alpha Invesco, said: &ldquo;First, we need to see which companies have ECB/FCCB exposure that is substantially large relative to the size of their balance sheets. If these companies are not hedged adequately, which is most likely to be the case, it is surely going to hit them.&rdquo;FCCB stands for foreign currency convertible bonds.&ldquo;Secondly, it will be difficult for companies that mainly cater to the domestic market and have negligible export revenues. Companies with a large proportion of exports have a natural hedge in such times,&rdquo; he &ldquo;said.Phalke said given the recent fall in midcap valuations, if current stock prices are well below the FCCB conversion prices, the issuers will opt for redemption.Indian companies with or without export revenues usually keep their forex exposure hedged, a trend that caught on mainly after the 2008 crisis.&ldquo;After Lehman crisis, this is the biggest shock for companies in terms of a steep rupee fall and most of them would have opted for hedging. Hence, there would not be any major risk on the capital borrowed. But the cost of servicing would pinch them in terms of higher hedging cost, impacting net margins,&rdquo; says G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.Among others, REC, Adani Power, Electrosteel Steels, Hindustan Oil Exploration Company, Fortis Healthcare and Lanco Infratech have ECBs, which are going to mature over next six months.\n\n    \n\n\n",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: India&rsquo;s first quarter GDP print is scheduled for release later on Friday, and there is lot of curiosity to know how the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing major economy fared in a quarter marked by trade tensions.\nEconomists estimate a quantum jump in economic growth, led by the manufacturing sector, thanks a weaker year-ago base. But they are not sure whether the growth will match the fourth quarter print of 7.7 per cent. Most are estimating it at 7.5-7.6 per cent. A few have gone overboard to project 8 per cent expansion.The world&rsquo;s second largest economy, China, reported a 6.7 per cent growth for June quarter compared with 6.8 per cent in March quarter.Abheek Barua, Chief Economist at HDFC Bank, said the external environment has been challenging for India since the beginning of this financial year. India&rsquo;s current account deficit has widened, oil prices have been volatile and the rupee has dropped to all-time lows. In contrast to this backdrop, the GDP growth numbers for the first quarter are likely to bring some good news, he said.Barua pegged his Q1 growth estimate at 7.6 per cent and says a favourable base effect should prop up growth numbers across sectors.&ldquo;It is not all just a statistical push, and there are some genuine signs of revival in the economy. The major push to growth is likely to come from manufacturing and services sectors, while agricultural growth is also likely to be supportive. On the demand side, private consumption could gain traction, especially on the back of stronger demand as reflected by lead indicators such as domestic passenger traffic, retail credit and consumer durables,&rdquo; Barua said.Lead indicators are showing strength in manufacturing and service sectors. With the rise in rabi output, which hit the market in Q1 of FY19, agriculture growth is likely to come in at 4 per cent. Mining activity is expected to show a pick-up too while agricultural activity is likely to be steady, with the allied agricultural sectors continuing to do well, said Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.&ldquo;The services sector (including construction) may witness a slight slowdown on a QoQ basis atop a high base. Government spending has been accommodative, which should bode well for the services sector. We expect the GDP growth print to come in at 7.5 per cent in FY19,&rdquo; the brokerage said.Economists at ICICI Securities believe growth in gross value added (GVA) moderated to 7.2 per cent YoY in June quarter from 7.6 per cent YoY in March quarter, led by a slowdown in momentum for agriculture and industry. The services sector is expected to clock a marginal sequential improvement, it said.&ldquo;GDP growth is expected to come in at around 7.5 per cent YoY in Q1, decelerating on a sequential basis, but sharply higher than the 5.6 per cent YoY growth print for Q1 of FY2018,&rdquo; it said. HDFC Bank&rsquo;s Barua said the recent fall in the rupee is likely to provide some support to exporters, while rising global protectionism and slower global growth might limit the pickup in exports this year.&ldquo;Therefore, a major support to growth needs to come from a sustainable recovery in private consumption and investment. Further, we expect government expenditure to play an important role in supporting growth. For the year, as a whole, we expect growth to rise to 7.3 per cent from 6.7 per cent in 2017-18,&rdquo; he said.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The fault lines in the economy are only getting deeper with each passing day. The rupee, which plunged to a new all-time low on Thursday, is the biggest casualty, even as the widening current account and fiscal deficits are posing new risks to the economy managers.And with fuel prices touching new highs every day, it is a raw deal for the common man, too. Rising crude oil prices are sure to push up the trade deficit, which is already ruling high. Remember, the spike in petrol and diesel prices will have a recoil effect on inflation, forcing the central bank to adopt a more hawkish approach while framing the monetary policy.The bad loan menace is another big problem which has already pushed several power companies to the brink. Looks like the economy is gasping for breath, taking a heavy toll on the confidence levels of industry and investors.Interestingly, the macro-economic concerns come at a time when the Modi government is pitching for a ratings upgrade with S&amp;P. In November last year, S&amp;P had ruled out an upgrade in India's sovereign rating, pointing to ballooning government debt and the slow growth in revenue collection.Political party leaders and economists analysed the state of the economy on a special edition of ET NOW&rsquo;s India Development Debate. Here are the key takeaways:PANEL VIEWMYTHILI BHUSNURMATHCONSULTING EDITOR, ET NOWRBI, as is common with central banks of all emerging market countries and even for some of the developed countries for that matter, always intervenes when they feel that movement is too sharp. So, what the RBI is doing in the process of intervention is to ensure that the depreciation is gradual and not too dramatic. So that&rsquo;s what the RBI has been doing for the past couple of weeks. Given the fact that we have over $400 billion reserves, I think $25 billion is not a large amount to spend.R GOPALANEX-SECY, DEPT OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRSTrade deficit is one factor that contributes to the value of the rupee but there are other activities going on outside where the EM currencies are facing a bit of a problem. We have dollar strengthening, you have got oil price increasing &mdash; all these factors are contributing to weakening of the rupee. On the eve of elections, there&rsquo;s always a tendency to slip the fisc a bit. There will be some slippages but there will be a greater attempt to see that the slippages are very marginal.SAUGATA BHATTACHARYACHIEF ECONOMIST, AXIS BANKThere are signs of some slippages; borrowings are relatively higher front-loaded again at this point of time. Tax collection is not that buoyant and robust as we had earlier expected. But to the government&rsquo;s credit, the fisc is not that big a problem at this point of time. More than the fiscal, I think the immediate problem at this point of time is the current account deficit.JAIMINI BHAGWATIFORMER AMBASSADOR AND RBI CHAIR PROFESSOR &mdash; ICRIERRBI&rsquo;s latest report mentions that the rupee is heavily overvalued. If you look at real effective exchange rates against six major currencies, the rupee is something like 25per cent overvalued even now. So, you have systematically high interest rates, both nominal and real in India compared to the USA. We have systematically avoided allowing the rupee to correct over the past, at least five, if not 10 years.",

Lead indicators show strength in the manufacturing and the services sector,\" Abheek Barua, Chief Economist, HDFC Bank said in the note.Barua further noted that with the rise in the rabi output, agriculture growth is likely to grow by 4 per cent.For the year, as a whole, HDFC Bank expects growth to rise to 7.3 per cent from 6.7 per cent in 2017-18.Major risks to growth include rising oil prices and the impact of an uneven monsoon on agricultural production.Going ahead, the report noted that a sustainable recovery in private consumption and investment is needed for a growth revival.\"On the demand side, private consumption could gain some traction especially on the back of stronger demand as shown by lead indicators like domestic passenger traffic, retail credit and consumer durables,\" the report said adding \"we expect government expenditure to continue playing an important role in supporting growth\".

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The Reserve Bank expects India's economic growth rate to accelerate to 7.4 per cent in the current financial year on pick up in industrial activity and good monsoon. In its annual report released today, RBI also said that its monetary policy will continue to be guided by the objective of achieving the medium-term target for retail inflation of 4 per cent, within a tolerance band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. It cautioned that India's external sector will have to confront global headwinds, but expressed confidence that the Current Account Deficit would largely be financed by foreign direct investment. Several experts, including largest lender State Bank of India, expects the CAD to widen this fiscal on account of persistent high oil prices and large trade deficit. The CAD was estimated at 2 per cent of the GDP in fiscal year ending March 2018. The report notes that agricultural production is likely to remain strong, growth impulses in industry are strengthening (propelled by a sustained pick-up in manufacturing and mining activity), corporate are reporting robust sales growth and improvement in profitability, and services sector activity is also set to gather pace. Also, revenue-earning freight traffic of railways has picked up, driven by stepped-up movement in coal, fertiliser and cement. \"Over the rest of 2018-19, the acceleration of growth that commenced in 2017-18:H2 is expected to be consolidated and built upon. \"Keeping in view the evolving economic conditions, real GDP growth for 2018-19 is expected to increase to 7.4 per cent from 6.7 per cent in the previous year, with risks evenly balanced,\" said the RBI's Annual Report. The report has maintained the projection regarding GDP growth for the current fiscal as estimated in the third bi-monthly monetary policy of 2018-19 announced earlier this month. Going forward, it said the up-tick in credit growth is likely to be supported by the progress being made under the aegis of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in addressing stress on balance sheets of both corporates and banks, recapitalisation of state-owned banks, and a positive outlook on the economy. \"The prevailing negative credit-to-GDP gap indicates that there is sufficient scope for credit absorption and expansion in bank lending on a sustained basis,\" the report said. On inflation which averaged 4.8 per cent during Q1:2018-19, is likely to face upside risks over the rest of the year from a number of sources, warranting continuous vigil and a readiness to head off those pressures from getting generalised, it said. Rising global commodity prices, especially of crude oil, and recent global financial market developments are firming up input cost pressures. The RBI has cautioned that global headwinds are likely to confront India's external sector in 2018-19. Even though exports have gathered momentum in April-June quarter of 2018-19, the worsening global trade environment as a result of \"protectionist policies\" may impinge upon external demand, it said. Elevated crude oil prices and the strengthening of domestic demand may push up the import bill. As per the report, over the medium-term, the pace and quality of growth will be anchored by progress on the unfinished agenda of structural reforms in -- resolution of banking and corporate financial stress; taxation; agriculture; liberalisation of the economy's external interface, especially with FDI; and galvanising the business environment. \"The hard-earned gains of macroeconomic stability that have defined the recent period as its greatest achievement need to be preserved as an imperative within this endeavour,\" it said. The Central Statistics Office will release the GDP estimate for the April-June quarter (Q1 of 2018-19) on August 31.",

            "articleBody": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seal is pictured on a gate outside the RBI headquarters in Mumbai, India, February 2, 2016. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui New Delhi: Reserve Bank of India said today that banks will witness further deterioration in their non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans due to the \"economic situation prevailing\" in the current fiscal. As per RBI's Annual Report 2017-18, gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) plus restructured standard advances in the banking system remained elevated at 12.1 per cent of gross advances at end-March 2018. The combined impact of the increase in provisioning against NPAs and mark-to-market (MTM) treasury losses on account of the hardening of yields eroded the profitability of banks, resulting in net losses, it said.\nIn a pre-emptive response, it said, the RBI allowed banks to spread their MTM losses over four quarters starting from third quarter.\n\"Going forward, the stress tests carried out by the Reserve Bank suggest that under the baseline assumption of the current economic situation prevailing, the GNPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) may increase further in 2018-19,\" it said.\nThe aggregate gross NPAs of SCBs increased primarily as a result of this transparent recognition of stressed assets as NPAs, from Rs 3,23,464 crore, as on March 31, 2015, to Rs 10,35,528 crore, as on March 31, 2018.\nWith deterioration in asset quality and the progressive implementation of Basel III warranting higher buffers, troubled public sector banks (PSBs) received capital infusions via the issuance of recapitalisation bonds and budgetary support.\n\"The Reserve Bank's revised prompt corrective action (PCA) framework became effective in April 2017. Eleven PSBs placed under this framework so far have been restricted in their operations and subjected to remedial action plan so as to prevent further capital erosion,\" it said.\nIn order to curb NPAs, RBI also put in place revised and harmonised guidelines for resolution of stressed assets during the year, replacing earlier schemes like Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A scheme), Strategic Debt Restructuring scheme (SDR), Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) scheme and Joint Lenders' Forum (JLF).\n\"Final guidelines relating to the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) were also issued in May 2018 to prepare the ground for banks to build durable buffers against potential liquidity disruptions,\" it said.\nA Parliamentary committee recently questioned RBI for failing to take preemptive action in checking bad loans in the banking system prior to the Asset Quality Review undertaken in December 2015.\nAccording to sources familiar with the report of the Standing Committee on Finance, RBI needs to find out as to why the early signals of stressed accounts were not captured before the AQR.\nThe report was adopted by the Committee headed by senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily today and is likely to be placed in the Parliament in the Winter Session.\nThe panel, which includes former prime minister Manmohan Singh as a member, wanted to know the reasons of ever-greening of stressed accounts through restructuring schemes of the RBI.\nThe issue of rising NPAs is a legacy issue and role of RBI has not been up to the mark, sources said.\nNPAs in public sector banks (PSBs) increased by about Rs 6.2 lakh crore between March 2015 and March 2018.\nThis led to substantial provisioning of Rs 5.1 lakh crore, sources said quoting the report.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nNEW DELHI: There are upside risks to inflation which call for vigil, said Reserve Bank of India in its Annual Report for 2017-18 today.Headline inflation is likely to face upside risks over the rest of the year while real GDP growth for 2018-19 may increase to 7.4 per cent from 6.7 per cent previously, the RBI said. The global economy expanded at a strong pace in the first half of 2018. Advanced economies (AEs)saw tightening of labour markets, firm commodity prices and resilient trade dynamics. Emerging market economies (EMEs) front-ran the AEs in Q1, but fell back somewhat in Q2 as capital flows exited on risk aversion generated by an array of headwinds such as trade wars, rising interest rates in the US, geopolitical tensions and rising crude oil prices, it stated. The RBI dwelt at length on a range of issues in its annual report. Let's have a look.Credit growthThe uptick in credit growth is likely to be supported by the progress being made under the aegis of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), in addressing stress on balance sheets of both corporates and banks, recapitalisation of PSBs, and a positive outlook on the economy. The prevailing negative credit-to-GDP gap indicates that there is sufficient scope for credit absorption and expansion in bank lending on a sustained basis.InflationHeadline inflation, which averaged 4.8 per cent during Q1 of 2018-19, is likely to face upside risks over the rest of the year from a number of sources, warranting continuous vigil and a readiness to head off those pressures from getting generalised. \"On the whole, headline inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2 of 2018-19; 4.8 per cent in H2 and 5 per cent in Q1 of 2019-20, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks evenly balanced,\" it said. Global headwinds to hit macros The worsening global trade environment as a result of protectionist policies may impinge on external demand. Elevated crude oil prices and the strengthening of domestic demand is seen to push up the import bill. \"With India being a net energy importer, the changing demand-supply dynamics in the international crude oil market may impact heavily on India&rsquo;s trade deficit,\" the apex bank said. CAD to be financed by FDI flowsThe RBI noted that the increase in limits for foreign portfolio investment in both government and corporate bonds augurs well for the prospects for external financial flows adjusted for downside risks. The current account deficit is expected to be largely financed by FDI flows.Steps to improve banking system to reach critical mass in 2018-19 With IBC put in place, the RBI has introduced a new framework for the resolution of stressed assets, which is more outcome-oriented and provides considerable flexibility for banks to determine the details of the restructuring process. This apart, amendments in IBC will improve the efficiencies in decision making under it. Also, the cutting down of voting threshold for the committee from 75 per cent to 66 per cent for all major decisions will induce energy into the system.Fiscal risks may emanate from many statesThe central bank bit the bullet by red flagging fiscal risks. During the year, fiscal risks are seen to emanate from many states going for elections, the additional burden of farm loan waivers announced outside budgeted outlays, and the implementation of pay/pension/allowances revisions. Revenue mobilisation remains the key to attaining the budgeted targets, it said. Step towards better supervisionAn Audit Management Application portal to handle various supervisory functions of the cybersecurity and information technology examination cell in the Reserve Bank and fully automate monitoring of returns has been envisaged in order to facilitate consistency and efficiency of the offsite monitoring mechanism.Infrastructure mission set to accelerateIn the road sector, the key targets are awarding works for around 20,000 km length of national highways, construction of 45 km per day vis-&agrave;-vis 27 km per day last year and developing ring roads around 28 major cities under the Bharatmala project.In railways, upgradation of Bengaluru and Mumbai suburban systems, Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail construction, installing modern facilities in railway stations as part of station redevelopment, and opening India&rsquo;s First National Rail and Transportation University in Vadodara will be the priorities.As for ports, more than 576 projects with an estimated cost of Rs 8,700 billion have been identified for implementation under the Sagarmala project.Over the medium term, the pace and quality of growth will be anchored by progress on the unfinished agenda of structural reforms in resolution of banking and corporate financial stress, taxation, agriculture, liberalisation of the economy&rsquo;s external interface, especially with FDI, and galvanising the business environment, the report stated.

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Renewables sector in India is expected to see strong growth and favourable policy support going forward as traditional fossil fuel power projects are facing growing transition risks, an HSBC report says. According to the global financial services major, the solar sector will continue to receive favourable policy momentum, especially given India's leadership role in the International Solar Alliance.  \"Given the woes (financial and operational) facing the coal power sector and rapidly falling renewable energy generation costs, we believe renewables in India will continue to see strong growth and expect favourable policy support,\" HSBC said in a research note.  Investment in the power sector in India is important to maintain economic growth and also to improve the livelihoods of large sections of the population which are still without electricity.  Coal now forms one-third of total installed generation capacity, but some projects are unable to sustain themselves due to issues including the non-availability of fuel, lack of purchase agreements and tariff disputes, the report said.  \"We think the economics will continue to shift in favour of lower carbon power in India, especially as it promotes solar,\" the report added.  According to the report, fiscal year 2016-17 was a turning point for renewables as newly installed capacity (11GW) surpassed that of newly installed coal (7GW) for the first time.  \"An additional 12GW of renewables (mostly wind and solar) was installed between April 2017 to May 2018, more than double that of coal power plants (5GW),\" the HSBC report noted.  Renewable installations have been outpacing coal largely because the price of solar power has declined by over 40 per cent, making it more competitive against coal and more attractive for new-build projects.",

An UNCTAD report, too, had stated that the foreign direct investment in India decreased to USD 40 billion in 2017 from USD 44 billion in 2016 fiscal.A decline in foreign inflows could put pressure on the country's balance of payments and may also impact the value of the rupee.

The rupee today breached the historic low of 70-mark against the US dollar today before recovering at close on suspected RBI intervention and the finance ministry's dismissing the concerns over its sharp fall.Photo/Swapan Mahapatra) (Story no. DEL53) NEW DELHI: The rupee is likely to average at 69 per US dollar this financial year, largely driven by stronger domestic macro fundamentals and foreign fund flows, says a report. According to a Bank of Baroda research report, India's twin deficit and inflation are at a \"far more comfortable position\" than in 2013. Besides recent fall in oil prices and strong foreign portfolio investors' (FPI) inflows will also support the domestic currency.  \"While near-term volatility cannot be ruled out as the rupee is highly correlated with other Asian emerging market (EM) currencies, we believe the rupee should stabilise sooner than later,\" Sameer Narang, chief economist at Bank of Baroda said in a research note.  He further said, \"For FY19, we expect it to average at 69/USD\".  The rupee has fallen 8.9 per cent this year, higher than the 4.6 per cent fall in Asian emerging market currencies amid global uncertainties and concerns over inflation. The rupee ended below the 70-mark against the US dollar for the first time ever on August 16.  According to the report, the policy divergence between the US Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Japan (BoJ), coupled with an improving US economy, has resulted in widening interest rate differentials between the US and other currencies.  But going forward, other central banks are looking at normalising their monetary policies and this will narrow the interest rate differential and put a lid on further appreciation of the US dollar, the report said.  The recent decline in oil prices is positive for the rupee. In addition, FPI inflows have also resumed and should put an end to the USD 24.6 billion intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  Some of the key risks to the rupee include a contagion in emerging market currencies, any geo-political risks to oil prices and prospects of trade wars driving global growth lower, the report added.",

The domestic currency on Thursday tanked 30 paise to close below the 70-mark at 70.11 against the US dollar due to renewed worries about a hike in US interest rates amid global trade war jitters.The rupee suffered its biggest single-day drop in past one week, snapping a two-straight session recovery trend, PTI reported. Forex sentiment wobbled with a resurgent dollar as currency traders increased their expectations for a fourth interest rate hike this year after the Federal Reserve released its meeting minutes overnight.The US Federal Reserve in meeting minutes indicated that it may hike rates again if the economy stays on track even as it flagged \"ongoing trade disagreements and proposed trade measures as an important source of uncertainty and risks\".On the global front, oil markets were steady in the early trade as the unresolved trade dispute between Washington and Beijing muted activity.Asian stocks fell after US-China trade talks ended without progress, with the markets braced for a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for hints on the direction of US monetary policy.",

During his absence, the charge was temporarily held by railways and coal minister Piyush Goyal.As reporters waited to get a comment from the finance minister, he got down to business, holding discussions with secretaries in the finance ministry and the chairmen of the direct and indirect tax wings of the government during the two hours that he spent in North Block.Although the details of the briefing was not available immediately, the government is confronted with the challenge of dealing with a weakening rupee, which fell below the 70 mark against the dollar a few days ago. There are fears that a depreciation will impact the current account deficit as imports get more expensive and inflate the oil bill. ",

            "articleBody": "\n\nBy Amanda CooperLONDON: Shipments of West African crude to Asia are set to reach a record high in August, driven by a surge in demand from Indian refiners, who will take more oil from the region than at any time since mid-2015. According to a Reuters survey of shipping fixtures and traders, some 890,000 barrels a day of West African crude will sail to India, compared with 600,000 bpd in July and almost double last August's 460,000 bpd. Total loadings for Asia will rise to 2.586 million bpd this month from 2.44 million bpd in July and 2.176 million bpd last August. Indian state refiner IOC took nearly half the total for India, while the privately held Reliance Industries took three cargoes, and HPCL and BPCL took one each. Of the 15 cargoes that will go to India, at least 9 will hold Nigerian grades, including Qua Iboe, Agbami and Usan. China's daily intake dropped to its lowest since May this year at 1.419 million bpd from 1.571 million bpd in July, reflecting a modest slowdown in refinery intake and less favourable shipping economics. Some 60 percent of crude that will head to China is Angolan. The premium of Brent crude futures to benchmark Dubai futures has widened this month to almost $2.00 from less than $1.00 in late July, while the premium to U.S. crude futures has also crept out towards $6.00 from near $2.50 a month ago. The relatively strong performance of Brent futures to other regional benchmarks means it has been cheaper for Asian buyers to take in the likes of U.S. shale or other Middle East grades at the expense of typical West African grades. However, the drop in the value of the currencies against the U.S. dollar of a number of key commodity importers, such as China and India, over the course of August might prompt a decline in flows in September and October, as buyers feel the pinch of an unfavourable foreign exchange rate. \"Despite the general weakness in emerging-market currencies, oil market players are relaxed about the potential adverse impact on global oil demand, especially now that the dollar is getting slightly weaker again,\" PVM Oil analyst Tamas Varga said. \"This upbeat mood will probably change if the dollar strengthens again and this strength proves to be prolonged.\" India has seen the value of a barrel of oil rise by nearly 56 percent in the last year and China a rise of 47 percent in local terms, compared with the 41 percent rise in the dollar value of Brent to around $74 a barrel.

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The government will meet the fiscal deficit target for the current fiscal although there could be some slippages in the current account deficit (CAD) because of high crude oil prices, a top finance ministry official said on Tuesday. The comfortable forex reserve built up over the last three years will help the government deal with the volatility in oil prices in the international market, the official said. He said however that price fluctuation has come down significantly and reached to manageable level. \"CAD will not be as good as the last year but it will not be as bad as some of the estimates because oil prices have not gone to the level people at some point of time projected. It will be pretty much in the range that we have estimated. It could be 10 basis points here or there,\" the official said, requesting anonymity. The official did not disclose the CAD estimate for the current fiscal, 2018-19. As per estimates, India's CAD may widen to 2.5 per cent of the GDP due to higher oil prices, a situation which has been accentuated by rupee depreciation. CAD, the difference between the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange, jumped to USD 48.7 billion, or 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2017-18. This was higher than USD 14.4 billion, or 0.6 per cent, in 2016-17. On the rupee's downward movement against the US dollar, the official said that there has been zero depreciation in the last four years. The rupee is more or less at 2013 level, he said, adding that there is no proposal to raise dollar through FCNR (B). With regard to fiscal deficit, the official said the government is committed to meeting the target of 3.3 per cent. In the Union Budget 2018-19 presented in February, the government had revised the fiscal deficit target for 2017-18 to 3.5 per cent from the earlier estimate of 3.2 per cent. In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit was Rs 5.91 lakh crore, or 99.5 per cent, of the Budget estimates. On the revenue front, the official said that income tax collection has been robust, with E-way and GST collection stabilising. Revenue collection under Goods and Services Tax (GST) is well on track and could exceed the target. He also said that the rate cut effected recently will have minor impact on the revenue collection but that would be compensated by increased compliance and E-way Bill. On disinvestment, he said, the government will meet the target of Rs 80,000 crore projected for the current fiscal. As far as inter-creditor agreement (ICA) is concerned, the official said as many as 31 banks and financial institutions have signed this.",

It will be very difficult for the government to try and push up the rupee,\" Kumar said at an event organised by industry body CII.\"There is a constituency that benefits from strong rupee...The constituency should be put on back foot,\" he added.The rupee on August 16 had slumped to a life-time low of 70.32 on strong demand for the US dollar.Kumar further said that economic policy making should not focus only on fiscal deficit number, arguing that large economies like USA, China and European Union do not give much importance to fiscal deficit.\"We must shift debate out of fiscal deficit. Countries like USA, China and European Union don't give (importance) to it... We need to move from that single, one number (fiscal deficit).\"Nobody is playing by rules, so we should learn to play as it suits our requirements,\" Kumar insisted.He said however that some revenue expenditure can be just be brought to zero.The main worry, he added, is trade deficit.\"I think it will be much better to try and push exports,\" he noted.Kumar argued that under the current circumstances, tightening fiscal and monetary policy at the same time would be asking for trouble.He also suggested that India should not boast of being a big economy while negotiating trade deals as the country's per capita income is still low.He said Niti Aayog will soon come out with development agenda for 'New India 2022'.\"We would like Planning Departments of State governments to work as State Niti Aayog,\" he said.Replying to a query, Kumar said nearly all states (excluding four) have signed MoU with the Centre for implementing Ayushman Bharat Healthcare Scheme.\"I met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, she is also willing to come on board,\" he said.",

REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD New Delhi: India&rsquo;s economy is set for a healthy growth trajectory in the medium term with positive impact of several reforms underscoring the nation&rsquo;s long-term potential, according to BHP, the world&rsquo;s largest mining company.&ldquo;We note in particular its ascent as the number one destination globally for announced greenfield foreign direct investment, the introduction of a nationwide Goods &amp; Services Tax, an improved institutional setting for infrastructure planning and project execution and the determined efforts of policy makers to address non-performing loans in the banking system, particularly in the steel and power industries,&rdquo; the Anglo-American miner said in its latest Economy and Commodity Outlook.The Melbourne-based firm, however, also cautioned that on a short-term note, moving into a critical election year for the central government, the observed lift in oil prices is likely to drive an increase in Indian inflation, and act as a drag on its balance of payments and fiscal position.&ldquo;Offsetting that is the reality of a strong rebound in commercial and industrial activity as the disruptive impact of earlier policy reforms fades,&rdquo; the outlook, authored by HuW McKay, Vice President, Market Analysis &amp; Economics at BHP, stated.The company also said it continues to view emerging Asia as an opportunity region with China, India, ASEAN and the global impact of China&rsquo;s Belt and Road Initiative expected to provide additional demand for its products. The $45 billion firm operates in the mining, metals and petroleum sectors.&ldquo;For the year ahead, we assess the directional risks to prices across our diversified portfolio are mixed. We anticipate benchmark prices for steel-making raw materials are likely to remain above long run marginal cost, on average. Within that grouping, metallurgical coal may sustain such a price level deeper into the cycle than iron ore,&rdquo; the outlook stated.It added that the upside and downside risks for oil are balanced and copper prices remain susceptible to swings in global policy uncertainty. However, the near&ndash;term commodity&ndash;specific fundamentals of both the oil and copper markets are sound.BHP today reported a 33 per cent jump in profit for the year ended June 2018 at $8.93 billion and a 20 per cent rise in total revenue to $45.81 billion.

This was higher than USD 14.4 billion, or 0.6 per cent, CAD in 2016-17 fiscal.According to official figures India's trade deficit, or the gap between exports and imports, in July widened to USD 18 billion, the most in more than five years.Trade shortfall puts pressure on the current account deficit (CAD), a key vulnerability for the economy.India's exports rose by 14.32 per cent to USD 25.77 billion in July, while imports during the month were valued at USD 43.79 billion.According to Nomura, the downside risks to exports remain due to a weaker global growth outlook though currency depreciation could provide some relief to exporters.On the other hand, import growth, is likely to remain elevated in the near-term due to high oil prices, though weak rupee and domestic slowdown will moderate imports in coming quarters.The rupee has been among the worst-performing currencies against the dollar so far this year and settled below the 70-mark for the first time in history on August 16 on strong demand for the US dollar amid ongoing Turkish crisis.",

            "articleBody": " KOLKATA: The rupee, which has taken a severe battering of late, is expected to stabilise at 68-69 per US dollar level riding on positive capital inflows this month, economic affairs secretary Subhas Chandra Garg said.The rupee is already Asia's worst performing currency and had touched an all-time low of 70.09 per US dollar on Tuesday.According to Garg, the current turmoil in Turkey, triggered by US sanctions, had not affected the perception of India. The flow of foreign portfolio investments (FPI) had not altered either and there had been no outflow in July, Garg said while speaking at an interactive session organised by the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry here.During the first three months, there had been outflow of capital and in the last year the total outflow was $20 billion, he added.\"If oil prices do not rise further, the chances of the rupee stabilising at 68-69 level is more,\" Garg said.When asked how the rupee will be affected if China devalued its currency, he said that for the first time in the last 20 years, the Chinese economy had experienced current account deficit (CAD).\"Now China's exports and imports are altering fundamentally. So far, the depreciation of the Chinese yuan was not so high. Even if the Chinese currency is devalued, India will not be affected as long as the depreciation of all currencies vis-a-vis the dollar was similar,\" he added.There would be no problem as terms-of-trade would not change, Garg said.\"However, we are watching closely to what extent China devalues its currency,\" he said.Owing to high oil prices, India's CAD had risen to 1.9 per cent for which the rupee was depreciating. This called for a need for higher capital inflows, he added.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: New GDP data does not change the reality that 'macro-economic instability' was highest under the previous UPA government period, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) member Surjit Bhalla said today. According to the back series data prepared by the by the Committee on Real Sector Statistics, constituted by the National Statistical Commission, Indian economy clocked a 10.08 per cent growth rate in 2006-07 under the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the highest since liberalisation of the economy in 1991. \"Rumour going around that UPA had higher growth; therefore no policy paralysis; \"new\" GDP data does not change reality that macro-economic INSTABILITY was highest under UPA-highest inflation ever, highest center + state fiscal deficits, highest corruption &amp; highest policy paralysis,\" Bhalla said in a tweet. The report has been released on the website of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI). The report compares growth rates between old series (2004-05) and new series based on 2011-12 prices. As per the old series (2004-05), the expansion in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant prices was 9.57 per cent during 2006-07, when Manmohan Singh was prime minister. As per the new series (2011-12), the growth number stands revised at 10.08 per cent. This is the highest growth rate recorded by the country after the economic liberalisation programme launched by the then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao. \"The GDP backseries data is finally out. It proves that like-for-like, the economy under both UPA terms (10 year avg: 8.1%) outperformed the Modi Govt (Avg 7.3%),\" the Congress party had said in a tweet yesterday. \"The UPA also delivered the ONLY instance of double digit annual growth in modern Indian history,\" it had said. The GDP numbers for the later years too have been revised upwards, according to the report. The National Statistics Commission had set up the committee to recommend suitable measures to strengthen systems and processes for collection, collation and dissemination of these statistics with possibility for improving timeliness.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the current financial year could be impacted by a host of factors including inflationary headwinds from elevated global crude oil prices and the government&rsquo;s decision to fix Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Kharif crops at one-and-a-half times, research agency India Ratings said. \nThe agency has revised down its economic growth forecast for the current financial year (2018-19) to 7.2 per cent from the earlier 7.4 per cent. &ldquo;The other headwinds lurking on the horizon are the rising trade protectionism, depreciating rupee and no visible signs of the abatement of the non-performing assets of the banking sector,&rdquo; the Fitch Group company said in a report today.\n\nDespite a likely normal rainfall in 2018, the agency now expects average retail and wholesale inflation in the current fiscal to be 4.6 per cent and 4.1 per cent, respectively, as against 4.3 per cent and 3.4 per cent forecast earlier due to the pass-through of global crude oil prices, increase in the minimum support prices of kharif crops and house rent allowance revision by the states. \n&ldquo;Although Ind-Ra expects the central government to meet its fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2018-19, the current account deficit is likely to touch $71.1 billion (2.6 per cent of GDP) in 2018-19 from $48.7 billion in 2017-18 (1.9 per cent of GDP) due to the widening trade gap,&rdquo; the report stated.\n\nThe country will also continue to face headwinds at the exports front even as annual value of exports touches $345 billion this fiscal, crossing the peak of $318 billion achieved in 2013-14. &ldquo;The recent global developments are threatening to turn into a trade/currency war between US and China. This is not good news for East Asian economies that export intermediate goods to China and in turn for India which is increasingly relying on its Look East policy to sustain and expand exports,&rdquo; the report stated.\n\nA host of factors including volatility in crude oil prices, portfolio inflows, normalisation of the monetary policy in the advanced economies and a likely $25 billion mobilisation from non-resident Indians will guide the level of rupee in relation to US dollar, which is expected to average 68.4 per USD through 2018-19. \n",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The Indian rupee on Thursday settled below the 70-mark for the first time ever against the US dollar. The loca l currency settled 27 paise down at 70.16. \nThe Indian currency has been under the pressure in the past few sessions due to big meltdown in the Turkish lira. Money market players say fears of a widening trade and current account deficit are also putting pressure on the rupee. \nCurrency experts believe that 70 to a dollar may not be the bottom and the rupee could weaken further in the coming days. The one key factor that is keeping market players on the tenterhooks is the volatility in the equity market as any FII outflow could only widen the current account deficit, ET had reported earlier. \n\nAs rupee continued to fall to new record lows, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said the Indian currency was overvalued and is moving towards its real value, and that it will not hurt the Indian economy. \n\"Let's be clear, the depreciation of the Indian Rupee against the USD is not indicative of a bad time for the Indian economy. Over the past three years, the rupee has been overvalued by approximately 17 per cent and the current depreciation of 9.8 per cent since January is a move towards its natural value,\" Kumar tweeted.\n\nIndia Ratings has recently revised its currency outlook and now estimates the rupee to average 68.4 against dollar through FY19 (April-to-July average: 67.5 against dollar). \n\n&ldquo;Volatility in crude oil prices, portfolio inflows, normalisation of the monetary policy in the advanced economies and a likely $25 billion mobilisation from non-resident Indians will guide the level of rupee in relation to US dollar,&rdquo; the rating agency said.

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The falling rupee will adversely impact the domestic steel sector as import of various raw materials will become expensive and the cost of servicing debt would also go up, government officials and experts said today.The rupee slumped 43 paise against the US dollar to trade at a life-time low of 70.32 on strong demand for the American currency.In general, a weaker rupee supports exports and at the same time protects the domestic industry, including steel, from imports as they become costlier, Joint Plant Committee(JPC) Chief Economist A S Firoz told PTI.He, however, warned that a weak rupee will adversely affect the Indian industry as it has to extensively depend on imported inputs such as coking coal, steel scrap etc.Besides, export volumes also can not be pushed because of the robust domestic demand of steel, he said.India's total export of finished steel increased 16.7 per cent to 9.62 million tonne (MT) in 2017-18 as compared to export of 8.24 MT finished steel in 2016-17.Domestic steel demand grew at 8 per cent in the first quarter of 2018-19, according to JPC.JPC is officially empowered by the steel ministry to collect data on the Indian iron and steel industry.Anjani K Agrawal EY Partner said the weakening rupee will increase cost of debt for many steel producers.\"The landed cost of imported coking coal will also rise. Passing through these cost increases may not be easy as steel is largely a domestic business, particularly in long products,\" he added.At the Interbank Foreign Exchange, the local currency opened at a record low of 70.25 a dollar, down from its previous close of 69.89, and weakened further to trade at a fresh low of 70.32, down 43 paise.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The trade war between the US and China is expected to deflect some of the heat from Washington&rsquo;s Iran sanctions away from India and provide New Delhi the opening to keep some Iranian oil flowing even after the curbs take effect on November 4.China&rsquo;s main oil importer, Unipec, the trading arm of the world's largest refiner by capacity Sinopec, earlier this month suspended US shipments. This triggered a buzz that Beijing intended to slap duty on US crude in retaliation to Washington&rsquo;s tariffs on Chinese exports, prompting refiners to keep off American oil.This is unlikely to change even after US crude was left out of Beijing&rsquo;s list of retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth $16 billion last week. Open opinion says this was done to avoid affecting shipments already on way or committed by Chinese refiners. The second is that Beijing wants to keep US oil as a bargaining chip to be used later.Industry players say either ways the situation works well for India. Executives of state-run refining companies involved in oil sourcing operations said due to the cloud of uncertainty, Chinese refiners were unlikely to resume buying US oil anytime soon. &ldquo;It takes two months for tankers to reach China from the US. Shipments would be fraught with the risk of being hit by tariffs if they are imposed in between,&rdquo; an executive said.China is the largest buyer of US crude in Asia. It is also the largest customer of Iranian oil. India is the second-largest buyer of Iran&rsquo;s oil. It is also looking at increasing US crude. &ldquo;If China is not buying US crude then that leaves India, with 5-6% annual demand growth and ability to process a wide variety of crudes, as the only major Asian buyer with capacity to absorb the supplies shunned by the Chinese. Other Asian buyers - South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand - may not be able to accommodate much extra US oil,&rdquo; he said.These facts give India bargaining room for securing favourable terms for US oil and a sanctions waiver. &ldquo;By making US crude a bargaining chip, China has also indicated its intention to keep buying Iranian oil, though there are reports that Beijing will not ramp up shipments from Iran. This means that Iranian oil will be in the market, which will help keep oil prices range-bound,&rdquo; he said.The presence of Iranian oil in the market will publicly blunt the sanctions impact and give India the leverage for either a waiver or keep importing Iranian shipments under the rupee trading arrangement practiced during the previous sanctions put by the Obama administration.Iran displaced Saudi Arabia as India&rsquo;s second-largest crude supplier in the first quarter of current fiscal, regaining a position it lost seven years ago, as refiners rushed to take advantage of Teheran&rsquo;s favourable terms.Iran was India's second-largest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia till 2010-11. But it dropped to seventh position after India gradually reduced import of Iranian oil to meet conditions of waiver granted by the Barack Obama administration when it imposed sanctions to curb Tehran&rsquo;s nuclear programme.Imports were gradually ramped up after the US and its European allies lifted the sanctions following the July 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action signed with Iran. In 2017-18, Iran became India&rsquo;s third-largest oil supplier, even after state refiners cut imports by a quarter in retaliation of Teheran dragging its feet over contract for developing the Farzad-B gas field discovered by a consortium of Indian companies.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: India would not be concerned if the rupee currency fell to 80 against the dollar after hitting an all-time low of 70.1 on Tuesday, as long as other currencies also depreciated, a senior finance ministry official said. The rupee, which has fallen more than 8 per cent this year, has pushed up prices of imported items such as petroleum products, commodities, electronics and engineering equipment, creating a headache for Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of a general election due early next year. Subhash Chandra Garg, economic affairs secretary at the finance ministry, said the rupee was still performing better than some other currencies and the country had sufficient foreign exchange reserves. \"Even if the rupee falls to 80, it will not be a concern provided other currencies also depreciate,\" Garg told reporters when asked about the currency's impact on the Indian economy. He said the rupee's fall was mainly due to external factors and any further selling of dollars by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) - it has already spent about $23 billion on intervention - may not help to further stabilise the rupee. Analysts said the falling rupee could lead to higher inflation as Indians pay more for imported goods and services. Opposition politicians blamed the government's economic policies. \"The Indian rupee just gave the Supreme Leader a vote of no confidence, crashing to a historic low,\" Rahul Gandhi, president of the main opposition Congress party, said in a tweet referring to his rival Modi. The rupee hit an all-time low of 70.1 per dollar earlier on Tuesday, as concerns about Turkey's economic woes spreading to other emerging markets like India persisted. Analysts said a rise in the 10-year benchmark bond yield to 7.82 percent on Tuesday reflected concerns about rising government borrowing costs in the market. India plans to raise 6.06 trillion rupees ($86.71 billion) in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019, to fund the fiscal deficit.",

            "articleBody": "A man checks his phone outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai, India April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo NEW DELHI:There seems to be no moment of respite for Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its inflation-targeting agenda.Just when gains in consumer prices eased, a renewed onslaught on the rupee amid a Turkish lira-led rout on emerging market currencies may require a response, and possibly more rate action.Government data on Monday showed retail inflation quickened 4.17 per cent in July from a year earlier, slower than the 4.5 per cent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. On Tuesday, the rupee breached the 70-mark against the dollar, keeping its position as Asia&rsquo;s worst-performing currency this year intact.A weaker currency complicates the RBI&rsquo;s job of keeping prices in check. The monetary policy committee led by Governor Urjit Patel increased interest rates twice since June to curb rising price pressures, while the RBI depleted $23 billion in foreign reserves to check currency volatility. The central bank doesn&rsquo;t target the exchange rate and attributes any rate moves to its goal of containing rising prices.&ldquo;The weak rupee is indeed making life difficult for Patel and his fellow members of the monetary policy committee,&rdquo; said Hugo Erken, a senior economist at Rabobank International in the Netherlands. &ldquo;The RBI tightening cycle will put an end to the current free fall.&rdquo;A selloff in Turkey&rsquo;s lira spread to other emerging market currencies, with the rupee losing the most since September 2013. Earlier this month, the RBI raised rates to the highest in two years against the backdrop of an economy that&rsquo;s growing faster than any other major nation.Local stocks, the currency and bonds fell as the turmoil in Turkey sparked worries of a potential market contagion and damped investors&rsquo; appetite for emerging market assets. The yield on the 10-year bond rose 7 basis points to 7.82 per cent on Monday. &ldquo;Turkey&rsquo;s troubles are unlikely to affect India much beyond a mild impact on the currency -- which, in any case, mostly reflects broader dollar strength,&rdquo; said Abhishek Gupta, India economist, Bloomberg Economics.Global risks, such as high oil prices and trade tensions, are weighing on the growth outlook, the International Monetary Fund said in its recent report on India that likened the economy to an elephant that&rsquo;s started to run. Despite the headwinds, the latest high-frequency indicators like the purchasing managers&rsquo; surveys show that India&rsquo;s start to the July quarter has been strong.&ldquo;The RBI may pause its rate hiking cycle for now after two back-to-back rate hikes, as the economy is temporarily in a goldilocks phase with moderating inflation and improving activity indicators,&rdquo; said Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt in Mumbai. She expects another rate hike in the early part of the next financial year, given that inflation is likely to stay above the RBI&rsquo;s projections.The central bank aims to keep inflation at the 4 per cent midpoint of its target band in the medium term and raised the forecast for the six months to March 31 to 4.8 per cent from 4.7 per cent.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Indian rupee hit a record low of 70.07 a dollar on Tuesday. In its sharpest single-day fall since September 2013, the rupee had hit an all-time low of 69.93 on Monday despite the Reserve Bank of India's intervention as heavy sell-off in global currencies, including Turkish lira, fuelled demand for safe haven assets. The rupee has lost nearly 7.2% this year and remains one of the worst performing emerging market currencies. An ET poll in June had said rupee could touch 70 to the US dollar by December-end amid global policy uncertainties. Nearly three-fourths of the respondents believed the local unit could touch 69 to the dollar with some even pointing to 70 by December-end. Now there are apprehensions of the rupee sliding to even 80. Peter Brandt, a widely-followed chartist and the CEO of Factor LLC, believes the worst is not over for the rupee and sees the Indian unit falling to 80 per dollar level if it breaches the crucial level of 71. \"Technically, should the rupee climb above 71, then we see the rupee going to 80 within four to six months. There could be a 10-15% run on the rupee,\" he told ET. How it's badA weak rupee against the dollar makes imports costlier. Some imports cannot be cut down such as oil, which can negatively affect India's current account deficit. In a vicious cycle, a depreciated rupee makes oil costlier since its India's chief import. Costlier oil means costlier vegetables and groceries since transportation costs go up. Weak rupee also makes education and holidays in foreign countries more expensive. The goods that use imported components such as computers, smartphones and cars also get more expensive. All import-based industry and trade suffers.How it's goodA weak rupee is good for exporters since they get more money for their exports. All export-based industry benefits from a weak rupee. For example, information technology and pharma companies benefit from a weak rupee since most of their revenues come from foreign countries. ",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India&rsquo;s economic activity is picking up, boosted by a long-awaited recovery in consumption that&rsquo;s helped cut down slack in the economy and underpinned sales of everything from cars to housing.Almost 60 percent of gross domestic product comes from private spending, according to estimates from New York-based CEIC Data Co., with the pick-up helping to fuel growth of more than 7 percent this year, making India the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing major economy. Yet the performance isn&rsquo;t uniform across all industries, with the banking and power sectors facing distress and global trade tensions clouding the outlook for exports.Here&rsquo;s a detailed look at which sectors are ticking and those that are ailing:The LeadersAutomobilesThe auto industry is on a strong footing. While demand is broad-based across markets, rural India appears to be doing particularly well, which is reflected in sales of two-wheelers and tractors. Companies such as Maruti Suzuki and Ashok Leyland are taking advantage of stronger demand by passing on higher prices to consumers.\n\t\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;Rural India appears to be doing particularly well, which is reflected in strong growth in the two-wheeler and tractor industry,&rdquo; analysts led by Hitesh Goel at Kotak Institutional Equities said.Oil and GasIf the automotive sector is doing well, can oil be far behind? India&rsquo;s energy appetite is surging, courtesy of its expanding middle-class and unrelenting demand to power a growing fleet of trucks, cars and motorbikes. The government&rsquo;s push for cleaner air by encouraging the use of cooking gas is driving refiners and attracting global majors such as Saudi Arabian Oil Co. to Rosneft PJSC.\n\t\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, an over-dependence on imports makes the nation vulnerable to a sustained spike in oil prices that can chip away at demand.Consumer GoodsAnother bright spot is the sector for fast-moving consumer goods, which is ranked as the fourth-largest in the economy by think-tank India Brand Equity Foundation. It&rsquo;s recovered well from the demand-disruptive and chaotic introduction of a consumption tax last year. Analysts see additional support for the sector coming from higher wages for millions of government workers as well as expectations of a recovery in farming due to higher guaranteed prices for some crops and a pick-up in public spending ahead of elections.\n\t\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteel and CementThe steel industry, which contributes almost 2 percent to GDP, has been reaping the benefits of increasing local demand and higher prices. Tata Steel Ltd.&rsquo;s sales during April through June climbed 8 percent year-on-year driven by automotive and special products&rsquo; demand, while JSW Steel Ltd. clocked a 11 percent growth in group sales. That&rsquo;s on top of steel consumption already rising to the highest in at least five years in the year ended March, according to data from the Steel Ministry.\n\t\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExports have, however, been declining this year because of protectionist measures taken by key consuming countries to protect local manufacturing.Cement manufacturers are facing a more uneven recovery as rising input prices eats into profit margins. Nevertheless, higher government spending to build infrastructure and affordable housing in the run-up to next year&rsquo;s elections should underpin demand.AviationThis is one sector that&rsquo;s continued to see double-digit traffic and capacity growth, as more people take to flying and carriers expand their fleet. But India is also the most price-sensitive of the world&rsquo;s large airline markets, and an oil price rally is a risk to growth.\n\t\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;Low oil prices which helped stimulate air-travel demand will now act as a drag on industry profitability and will slow capacity additions,&rdquo; Bloomberg Intelligence&rsquo;s Rahul Kapoor wrote in a note. &ldquo;We remain long-term positive but see near-term headwinds,&rdquo; he said.The StragglersBankingWhile demand for bank loans is growing from a year ago, the industry&rsquo;s gross bad-loan ratio may increase to 12.2 percent in the fiscal year through March 2019 -- the highest in almost two decades -- from 11.6 percent last year, according to data from the Reserve Bank of India. The deterioration in asset quality is eroding capital buffers at the lenders and curtailing their ability to take on financing for large projects.\n\t\n\t\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Our Economists Say...&ldquo;Nearly one in every six rupees of credit advanced by public-sector banks has already turned sour.

            "articleBody": " WASHINGTON: The IMF on Wednesday described the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a \"milestone reform\" in India's tax policy, but pushed for a simplified structure, saying the multiple rate structure and other features could give rise to high compliance and administrative costs.In its annual country report, the International Monetary Fund also said that a dual rate structure with a low standard rate and an additional higher rate on select items can be progressive and preserve revenue neutrality.The GST is an indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services in India. It came into effect on July 1, 2017.The IMF said that GST is a milestone reform in India's tax policy, taking the important step of unifying and harmonising numerous indirect taxes across all states of the federation and the central government.\"Yet, the GST has a complex structure with a relatively high number of rates (and exemptions), which could be simplified without sacrificing progressivity of the current GST and with potentially significant gains from lower compliance and administrative costs,\" it said.A dual rate structure with a low standard rate and an additional higher rate on select items can be progressive and preserve revenue neutrality, while streamlining exemptions would further contribute to progressivity and reduce compliance and administrative costs, the IMF recommended.The IMF said that with the consumption basket of the rich taxed at higher rates than that of the poor, the GST as presently designed has an effective tax rate rising with household consumption. A revenue-neutral reduction in the number of rates would raise the effective rates for poorer households while reducing those for richer households. This is the key cost of moving to a simpler system, it argued.In its report the IMF said the implementation of the GST led to the key step of harmonising indirect tax rates on goods and services that previously differed across different states and the centre, and brought services into the state tax net.However, India belongs in a small group of five countries having four or more GST rates: four non zero rates of five per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent, and 28 per cent; special low rates of three per cent on gems and jewelry and 0.25 per cent on rough diamonds; and a GST \"cess\" levied on demerit goods. In comparison, among 115 countries with VATs, 49 have a single rate, and 28 have two rates, it noted.\"The multiple rate structure and other features of India's GST environment could give rise to high compliance and administrative costs,\" it said.The goods and services tax created a unified national market for the first time by lowering internal barriers to trade - effectively establishing a free trade agreement for a market of over 1.3 billion people, said Ranil Salgado, IMF mission chief for India.The tax is also expected to increase the amount of economic activity taking place in the formal sector of the economy - leading to better quality and more reliable jobs, he added.\"As a result, the goods and services tax should improve productivity and boost medium term potential growth, while also creating room for the government to increase much needed social and infrastructure spending,\" Salgado added.",

            "articleBody": "\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Archit GuptaNew Delhi: The Goods and Services Tax is a reform designed to create an ecosystem where free and fair competition can thrive. The state and centre in unison decided to pool in their resource and sovereignty to create this fiscal consolidation for the common goal of economic prosperity. India&rsquo;s first federal institution, the GST reform does away with the old multilayer arbitrary tax scheme, making it easier to administer taxes while making revenue collection more efficient.When state and centre have the autonomy to levy charges based on their preferences, the entire system is distorted a\n\t\n  \n\n\n\nnd the movement of goods also becomes difficult. Therefore, rooting out redundancy in a tax regime is important to escape the tax on tax effect. GST has put in place simple and homogeneous tax, the spoils of which can be utilized by the state and the centre equally.A wide price drop across the spectrum is noticeable, something that was absent in the previous tax regime. The creation of a unified national market across the country -under the banner of GST-has increased manufacturing activities. In the recent GST council meet, the key area of focus was the cottage industry. The rates for a number of raw materials were rationalized in a bid to boost the country&rsquo;s small-scale industry. In these aspects, it resonates with the Make in India Programme which aims at making India a manufacturing hub. While India&rsquo;s GDP did slip to 6.1 in the first quarter of the year 2017 it has bounced back to 6.3 and continues to progress. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ruled out any significant inflationary impact due to an increase in taxes. The reason being that a large number of items in the CPI were exempted from GST, and the effect of a rise in the tax rate on some items was compensated by a dip in the rates on other items. A notable rise is visible in the indices, it reflects the recovery of the economy against the recent slowdown. The Index of Industrial production (IIP) has seen an average rise of 1.1 since July 2017. GST has pushed the economy one step closer to a common market i.e free movement of capital and services. Doing business now has become easier and the hassle-free movement of the goods enables smoother transport thereby plugging in the logistical inefficiencies. The introduction of a GST Network and E-Way bills has solidified the country's supply chain and put in place a structure that facilitates transparency. Now a dealer can track their shipments whether it is intrastate or interstate.Under GST the efficacy of Input Tax Credit has significantly increased. It eliminates the cascading taxes and also incentivises the dealer to avail more benefits upon revealing his transactions. This adds transparency and acts as a self-policing mechanism, as the economic incentive for avoiding tax has come down.This uniquely ambitious implementation is still in its nascent stages and to evaluate its performance at this stage would be presumptive. The mechanism is still being tweaked to perfection as the amendments keep rolling in. The recent 28th GST council meet saw a range of changes implemented across the spectrum. Despite the heavy criticism, the economy seems to be picking up pace and hopefully the benefits of GST will become even more prominent. A proper analysis of GST&rsquo;s impact on the economy can only be done once the policy has fully taken shape. There are lot more changes yet to come, but we as a nation must take pride in where we stand today with GST. Implementing such a large scale rollout is a daunting task, one that the government has done with much dexterity. The writer is Founder &amp; CEO ClearTax",

            "articleBody": " Amid the trade war with the US, China has reported a current account deficit of $28.3 billion in the first half of this year, which is the first in 20 years for the world's second largest economy. China also recorded its first quarterly current account deficit in nearly 17 years this year, ending its dream run of accumulating trade surplus as top exporter for years and the deficit carried on to the first half of this year. The deficit in the current account stood at $28.3 billion in the January-June period, down from $34.1 billion in the first quarter, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement.  China's service trade posted a deficit of $147.3 billion up from $73.6 billion three months earlier. The spending on trips, transport, and intellectual property rights contributed to the bulk of the deficit, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.  China however saw a goods trade surplus of $155.9 billion in H1 2018. This is the first half-year deficit in 20 years as spending on overseas services continued rising and outpaced income generated from the sale of goods by the world's largest exporter, Caixin magazine reported. The country's current account surplus has been steadily shrinking since the 2008 economic crisis as it moved towards increasing domestic consumption to reduce dependence on declining exports, which were the mainstay of its economic growth. The world's second largest economy posted 6.9 per cent GDP last year and the government has fixed 6.5 per cent as this year's growth target. China's overall trade and current account surpluses have fallen significantly as a percentage of its GDP since 2007.  Its current account surplus declined from 9.9 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 1.3 per cent in 2017, according to the data of SAFE.  Analysts forecast a narrowing surplus or more frequent current account deficits against the backdrop of trade tensions between China and the US.  Caixin quoted Zhang Ming, chief economist at Ping An Securities as saying that as goods trade comes under pressure and as service trade continues expanding, China may see more current account deficits.  Zhang said the deficit also reflects a falling domestic saving rate, which may be partly because of the aging population.  The current account deficit for China came amid the intensifying trade tariff war with the US as President Donald Trump continue to pile pressure on Beijing by threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese products to reduce the trade deficit which amounted to over USD 375 billion last year in the total bilateral trade of about $636 billion.  Though concerned about the impact on its exports to the US, China too has threatened retaliation to protect its interests.  SAFE said in yesterday's statement that China's international balance of payments was within a range of equilibrium last quarter and will continue to remain reasonable in the future.  The data also showed stable cross-border capital inflows in the second quarter.  China's financial account maintained net inflows, with a surplus of $18.2 billion. Net foreign direct investment stood at $58.6 billion.",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday hiked repo rate following its August monetary policy meet. The central bank's monetary policy committee (MPC), headed by governor Urjit Patel, raised the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.50 per cent.The RBI  has maintained a 'neutral' stance in the policy. This is the first time since October 2013, where RBI has gone for a back-to-back rate hike, having increased repo rate by 25 bps to 6.25 per cent in its last policy meet in June.The repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends short-term money to the banks. Ahead of the announcement, the Street was divided on whether the RBI will hold rates or go for a rise. In a Reuters poll, 37 out of 63 economists last week said the RBI will raise rates, while 22 said the next hike would come later this year, or early in 2019. The hike comes on back of rising retail inflation, which spiked to a a five-month high of 5 per cent in June on costlier fuel.The government has mandated the RBI to keep inflation at 4 per cent (+/- 2 per cent), the upside of which has now been breached for eight straight months. Earlier this month, the Union Cabinet steeply hiked the minimum support price (MSP) for kharif crops, including Rs 200 per quintal for paddy. A SBI research report notes that the MSP hike could statistically push up retail inflation by a further 73 bps. Moreover, global crude oil prices continue to remain volatile. ",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: The Indian economy is likely to have witnessed solid economic growth in the April-June quarter but leading indicators suggest a slowdown in the coming months, says a Nomura report. According to the global financial services major, India's economic recovery has peaked and growth rates are likely to get constrained in the second half of this year.  \"Our proprietary indicators suggest the inflection point for the cyclical recovery may just be around the corner,\" Nomura said in a research note.  India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at the fastest pace in seven quarters at 7.7 per cent in January-March quarter on robust performance by manufacturing and service sectors as well as good farm output.  The report said tighter financial conditions, slowing global growth and adverse terms of trade will start to constrain growth in second half of 2018.  Nomura expects GDP growth to peak in April-June quarter and then moderate to 7.2 per cent in the second half of 2018 from around 7.8 per cent in first half.  On Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy stance, the report said the current macroeconomic conditions merit a 25 bps rate hike in the forthcoming policy meeting on August 1.  \"For now, strong core momentum, sticky global oil prices and higher minimum support prices suggest conditions are ripe for another 25 bp rate hike in August. We expect a long pause on policy rates thereafter as growth and inflation slow,\" Nomura said.  In June, the Reserve Bank of India had upped its retail inflation projection by 0.30 per cent and kept the policy stance in the neutral zone, even as it hiked the key rate by 0.25 per cent to 6.25 per cent.",

Infrastructure takes time to build, and perhaps more so in India than for many other countries,\" S&amp;P Global Ratings credit analyst Abhishek Dangra said.  The Indian government estimates infrastructure investment of $4.5 trillion will be needed through 2040, it said.  In an article titled 'India's Infrastructure Marathon: Why Steady Growth Can't Close The Supply Gap', S&amp;P said India is making progress at scaling up its infrastructure, but still has a long way to go before it can close the sizable deficit between supply and demand.  \"Project delays and cost overruns are attributable to complex land acquisitions and environmental issues. And in all democracies, societal considerations play a part, too,\" S&amp;P said.  The country's progress at scaling up its infrastructure is shown in its decreasing power deficits, high passenger growth for airports, rising renewable capacity, and large metro train projects in progress. The government is leading the buildup in view of growing urbanisation, said the US-based rating agency.  \"We believe the power sector is moving towards equilibrium in demand and supply from a deficit situation. However, fortunes will vary for thermal and renewables,\" Dangra said.  \"No more new thermal power capacity is required until 2027, other than for projects already under construction; while renewables will continue their strong growth based on competitive tariffs,\" he added  The report says that capital expenditure (capex) will remain high for Indian infrastructure players across sectors. However, leverage trends vary.  \"Rated utilities will likely maintain elevated capex, but the commissioning of new capacities and regulated returns on investment should increase earnings. As a result, we expect the segment to deleverage,\" it added.  S&amp;P said the infrastructure sector has high correlation with the overall economic environment. Macroeconomic roadblocks could strain the government's budget or reduce project returns for the private sector.  These risks include currency weakness, global trade protectionism, and rising inflationary strains that could push up interest rates. Elections scheduled for 2019 could also fuel political and policy uncertainty, S&amp;P said.  \"The intensity and duration of macro shocks will be key to their overall impact. We still believe that India's economic growth opportunities and the viability of projects should continue to attract capital,\" Dangra noted.",

This system will check for coherence and transparency of data and if the data is aligned with each other,&rdquo; said an official aware of the details.ET had reported in October 2016 that the government has set up five committees to overhaul the country&rsquo;s statistical system and restore the credibility of growth numbers.&ldquo;We should be in a position to see data on single window and though the existing agencies will keep producing their respective data, it should look to the user that the data has come from the same source,&rdquo; the official said.The current practice of data analysis entails collecting data from different sources and analysing it on a spreadsheet.",

            "articleBody": "Workers during the manufacturing of a rail coach at Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai on Wednesday.Photo NEW DELHI: The world&rsquo;s fastest growing major economy, India, is showing signs of a recovery in animal spirits, suggesting the mid-term outlook can weather global trade tensions and emerging market strains.A cross section of forward-looking indicators compiled by Bloomberg News show largely positive signs. Sentiment in the manufacturing and services sectors -- both of which make up nearly 80 per cent of the $2.6 trillion economy -- rebounded in June, with new orders picking up pace. Bank loan disbursals are growing while auto sales -- a barometer of overall demand -- are expanding at double-digits.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is optimistic about growth and a narrowing output gap. The six-member rate-setting committee sees the recovery pushing inflation higher in the coming months -- enough to convince analysts and markets that a back-to-back rate increase is due on Wednesday. Any tightening in monetary policy comes amid concerns that the government may ease purse strings and miss budget targets ahead of general election in 2019.Investors and economists expect RBI to hike rates as inflation is well above central bank&rsquo;s medium-term target of 4 per cent. The outlook is set to worsen as oil prices stay high and currency slides.Abhishek Gupta, an economist with Bloomberg Economics in Mumbai who&rsquo;s among a minority predicting the RBI won&rsquo;t hike this week, said there&rsquo;s reason for caution and cited favorable base effects for spurring the pick-up in bank credit.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason we are less upbeat on the economic growth outlook than the central bank,&rdquo; Gupta said. &ldquo;We see GDP growth recovering to 7.2 per cent in fiscal 2019 from 6.7 per cent in fiscal 2018, below the Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s forecast of 7.4 per cent, as of June.&rdquo;BUSINESS ACTIVITYActivity in India&rsquo;s dominant services industry rebounded in June from a mild contraction the prior month, expanding at its quickest pace in a year. That pulled up the Nikkei India Composite Index to its highest since October 2016 with manufacturing activity also showing signs of growing at a faster clip.A sure-shot sign of growth in demand is the reading of Nikkei&rsquo;s index for new orders in June, which also surged to its highest since October 2016. That should give confidence to businesses to produce more and in the longer run draw-down inventories and close the output gap.Output prices are still rising, although the pace has somewhat stagnated. Nevertheless, the RBI says that companies are increasingly finding their pricing power and transferring higher input costs to consumers. This is likely to stoke inflation and keep the central bank on a hawkish watch.EXPORTS GROWTHThe export industry is still recovering from the double blow of demnonetisation and implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST). It lagged the global economic recovery and now with trade war clouds gathering, the outlook isn&rsquo;t too great. The only silver lining is a weaker rupee which is probably going to make software exports more competitive.CONSUMER ACTIVITYData from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) show that the industry produced nearly 17 per cent more vehicles in the April-June period than a year ago. Passenger vehicle sales grew close to 20 per cent during that period and makes for a handy indicator in a country which has no retail sales data to track consumer spending. The data also shows commercial vehicles sales rose more than 50 per cent and two-wheelers more than 15 perc ent.Bank loans are one signal that the RBI believes holds promise. Credit to various sectors including agriculture has risen 12.3 per cent year-on-year, data available as of July show.Not everyone agrees with the RBI&rsquo;s assessment though. Bloomberg Economics&rsquo; Gupta says rising borrowing costs are crimping corporate bond issuances and this indicates that total credit flowing to the corporate sector is weak.ECONOMIC ACTIVITYAfter a dip in March, foreign direct investments picked up pace in April and May. While that is good news for the broader investment climate, given the risk of an election next year and the threat of policy paralysis before that, inflows could slow in the coming months. That, of course, could have an impact on the India&rsquo;s external finances, where the current account gap is set to widen in the financial year to March 2019.Growth in mining and heavy industries -- which account for 40 per cent of industrial output -- has been rather anemic, easing to a 10-month low in May due to weaker steel and cement output and a contraction in crude and natural gas production. It&rsquo;s not all bad news though. For instance, coal production rose by double digits for the second month in a row in May albeit at a slower pace. Besides, electricity generation went up 3.5 per cent in May compared to 2.1 per cent in the previous month.",

Truck owners and operators are demanding for the reduction in central and state taxes by getting diesel under the GST so that price of the deregulated commodity can be reduced.Photo/Santosh Hirlekar) JAIPUR: As per the data made available by the Rajasthan Transport Department, there has been 32.16 per cent increase in the green tax collection in Rajasthan. This is a positive news for the government as many cities in the state are dealing with acute environmental pollution.Green tax is levied on pollutants or goods that repeatedly harm the environment. Rajasthan government initiated green tax in the year 2006-07 to curb the growing pollution in the state. According to the rules, green tax is collected at the time of registration of vehicles and renewal of the certificate of the registration under Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.\n\t\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Commissioner of Transport, Ram Chandra Yadav, while talking to TOI said that the reason for the increase in green tax collection is the time-to-time increase in the rate of green tax. &ldquo;As the pollution is increasing, tax rates have also been increased by the government. Diesel vehicles are taxed heavily as compared to green fuel vehicles. Same applies to the heavy vehicles as they spread more pollution. The tax is being spent in various ways as mentioned by the government,&rdquo; Yadav said.\nSurprisingly, there is only 2% increase in the registration of vehicles in the last three years. In the year 2016-17, 62% green tax has been collected from new vehicles and only 38% from old vehicles.Jaipur city had collected the highest green tax in 2016-17 followed by Jodhpur and Udaipur. Even in districts, Jaipur is on the top in green tax collection, followed by Jodhpur and Ajmer districts. The lowest amount of tax is collected from Shahjhanpur and Ratanpur cities, while the lowest tax collection among the districts is from Bharatpur.The green tax collected is given to the Rajasthan Transport Infrastructure Development Fund (RTIDF) from where it is being utilised in the work of metro, Rajasthan State Road Transport Department etc. Out of the total tax collected, taxes on vehicles was 7.49% in Rajasthan.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India is under pressure from 15 other Asia-Pacific countries, including China, to commit to eliminate duties on at least 90% of goods it trades with them under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) being negotiated.These countries want to conclude the pact this year and say this is the &ldquo;last window of opportunity&rdquo; as India will get into election mode very soon. Trade negotiators from the 16 countries are meeting in Thailand at present to reduce differences before a key minister-level meeting next month in Singapore. &ldquo;Things are not very bright. They say this is the last window of opportunity to conclude the agreement this year,&rdquo; said a negotiator.Negotiations on intellectual property, rules of origin and ecommerce are being held besides trade in goods, services and investment in the ongoing round of talks. Commerce secretary Rita Teaotia has said speedy and successful conclusion of the agreement would be possible only with inclusion of a higher level of services and investment in the India-Asean trade basket. &ldquo;Today, the conversation is that the agreement on goods is easy and therefore the ambition should be to move from 86% (of total traded items) to 92%. On the other hand, the argument is not to go beyond 60% of services and that too with several caveats,&rdquo; she recently said at an event.RCEP is a comprehensive free-trade agreement including goods, services, investment, competition and intellectual property rights between 10 Asean countries and six freetrade agreement partners &mdash; Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. Of these nations, India has trade deficit with as many as 10 countries, including China, South Korea and Australia. &ldquo;The cardinal principle of any trade deal is give and take, but we are not getting anything from this pact at this point,&rdquo; said Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning in the School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University.Another trade expert tracking the agreement said this pact without a high level of ambition in services and investment would open a &ldquo;Pandora&rsquo;s box&rdquo; where all developed countries including the US, Canada and the EU would want access to India&rsquo;s goods market. &ldquo;We will be under pressure to sign a goods-only agreement initially by all these countries as they all want our goods market,&rdquo; he said.While others want a speedy conclusion, there is divided opinion about the trade agreement in India. Many departments and ministries, including agriculture, defence and economic affairs, have opposed the deal, saying it would hurt India&rsquo;s interest.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The GST Council delivered a fresh round of rate cut on Saturday to benefit consumers, slashing the levy on nearly 100 items, including white goods, sanitary napkins, handicrafts, perfumes and paints, in what was seen as a pre-election bonanza. It also eased the burden for hotels, the textiles sector and small businesses at a marathon nine-hour meeting.A large number of the items, which faced 28% levy, such as refrigerators and washing machines, were moved to the 18% slab as part of a strategy to keep only sin and luxury goods such as tobacco, soft drinks and cars in the top bracket.Of the 49 items in the top slab, rates on 17 have been reduced to 18%. &ldquo;This is a major step towards rationalising the 28% tax slab which has been narrowed down to only a few commodities in the past 13 months,&rdquo; Union minister Arun Jaitley tweeted.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tThis is a major step towards rationalising the 28% tax slab which has been narrowed to only a few commodities in the past thirteen months.&mdash; Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley)1532187661000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate reduction along with several clarifications will leave the Centre and states poorer by Rs 8,000-10,000 crore on an annual basis. The rate cuts come on the back of an improvement in collections in recent months. Collections may fall now, but consumption to rise, says GoyalPiyush Goyal, who chaired his maiden GST Council meeting, told reporters that better compliance and higher consumption apart from boosting economic growth and employment will make up for the revenue loss. Although there was a proposal to also pare the levy on cement, for the second time, the council opted to retain it in the top bracket as it would have left a Rs 20,000-crore hole.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&ldquo;The reduction in rates will benefit 125 crore people. Every state wanted that citizens should feel the benefit of GST for the support that consumers and businessmen have provided...,&rdquo; Goyal said at a press meet where several finance ministers were present.Tax experts too saw Saturday&rsquo;s rationalisation as a relief for the aam aadmi. &ldquo;Summary of GST proposal for a common man: You can celebrate Rakhi in a clean and newly-painted house while having an ice-cream and watching a movie on a small TV...with multiple gift options ranging from footwear to washing machine,&rdquo; said Pratik Jain, who heads the indirect tax practice at consulting firm PwC.The rate cuts come on the back of improvement in collections in recent months, with Goyal being optimistic about the GST kitty swelling to Rs 13 lakh crore during the current fiscal year compared to the target of Rs 12 lakh crore. Since its launch last July, the GST Council has reduced rates on over 320 items and with Saturday&rsquo;s reduction, the number will swell by almost a third. This is the biggest rate cut since last November.&ldquo;The rate reductions will increase volumes by reduction of prices as anti-profiteering provisions necessitate passing on benefits to consumers. The reductions in rates may lead to lower tax collections for next few months, but it will lead to volume expansion which could more than make up for the reduction, especially as we are headed for the festive season,&rdquo; said M S Mani, partner at consulting firm Deloitte India.",

New Delhi: The 28th meeting of the GST Council chaired by interim finance minister Piyush Goyal is currently underway.A number of key decisions are likely to be taken at the meeting including revision in slabs for almost three dozen items.\n  \n\nThe fitment committee of the GST has recommended GST exemption on sanitary napkins and deities made of marble or stone. It has also recommended reduction in the GST slab for lithium ion batteries used in electronic items from the current 28 per cent to 18 per cent along with a slew of reductions in other items like bamboo flooring, ice making machines, vending machines, water coolers etc. The GST Council is also expected to discuss the recommendations on imposition of cess on sugar. A GoM headed by Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had rejected the proposal to impose cess on sugar to clear dues of sugarcane farmers. The GoM had, however, recommended reduction of GST on ethanol to 12 per cent from 18 per cent.The imposition of GST on ATF and natural gas is not on the agenda but the Council could discuss it, as per reports.The GST Council may also consider the constitution of a National Appellate Tribunal in Delhi with three regional benches. The tribunal will include members from judiciary as well as tax departments. It will hear appeals against the order of the appellate authority set up by states under the GST regime. ",

            "articleBody": "Removing barriers faced by micro, small and medium firms (MSMEs) with respect to accessing capital, hiring workers and acquiring land will help these firms expand and increase productivity.\nNew Delhi: A quantum jump in exports presents a tremendous opportunity for India. Nearly two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s production takes place in global value chains. Integrating with these supply chains will not only bring welfare gains, they will also increase efficiency and drive growth. Conditions are ripe for India to enhance exports to boost economic growth. India&rsquo;s economy cannot survive without exports. In 2017-18, exports of goods and services contributed about 12 per cent of India&rsquo;s GDP. In contrast, exports made up over 42 per cent of South Korea&rsquo;s GDP. Similarly, in 2006, when China was growing at nearly 13 per cent, the share of exports in GDP was more than 37 per cent. For India to achieve double digit growth, exports will be a crucial part of the strategy.Although India&rsquo;s exports have been rising of late, there remains ample room for further growth. In 2017-18, exports of goods and services grew by nearly 13 per cent. Exports grew by over 20 per cent in May 2018 compared to May 2017. It seems as if the dip in exports witnessed over the last five years may be behind us. This is an opportune time to shift gears and pursue exports more aggressively, building on the government&rsquo;s existing initiatives.Several measures, such as ensuring exporters receive GST refunds for raw materials in a timely manner, are undoubtedly critical to raising exports in the short term. At the same time, higher exports must be sustained in the medium and long term. This will not be possible if we don&rsquo;t remove the barriers to firms&rsquo; scaling up.Larger firms not only witness lower per-unit costs, they also benefit from global competition that drives them to continuously increase productivity levels. We don&rsquo;t need to look far from home to see this in practice. India&rsquo;s automotive sector has been successful in large part due to the ability of domestic firms to scale up.Promoting clusters and zones of production will facilitate firms becoming larger. The government is focusing on manufacturing clusters, especially around coastal areas so that exports can be dispatched faster given their proximity to ports. Cluster-based manufacturing will allow firms to save on costs while the location close to coastal areas will save transportation cost and time.In 2010-11, 72 per cent of India&rsquo;s manufacturing workforce was employed in firms with less than 20 workers each. However, they contributed less than 12 per cent of manufacturing output. Removing barriers faced by micro, small and medium firms (MSMEs) with respect to accessing capital, hiring workers and acquiring land will help these firms expand and increase productivity.In 2017, India ranked 146th out of 190 economies on the World Bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;trading across borders&rdquo; component of doing business, which measures the time and cost (excluding tariffs) associated with documentary and border compliance and domestic transport procedures for trading goods. Indian exporters on average took nearly four times the time taken by Chinese exporters to comply with border compliance requirements in 2017.We can reduce border and port turnaround times and lower the cost of trading through a number of measures. First, we need to focus on digitisation across ports. Last mile online access and moving processes completely online will help cut down compliance times drastically. Second, we should ensure that major non-Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) ports are converted to EDI ports urgently for faster clearances. The EDI message exchange system facilitates documentation related activities such as authorisations across departments.Third, we must ensure policy consistency to reduce informational barriers. The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) issued about 173 tariff-related notifications between April 1, 2015 and June 27, 2018. The large number of additional notifications increases the complexity of trade rules.States govern many issues related to ease of doing business. For example, they grant firms electricity and water connections. They also govern property registration. Thus, states play an important role in helping firms operate smoothly. Studies have found Indian states that engage in foreign and interstate trade are richer than non-exporting states. Thus, states also need to play a major role in boosting exports by easing the business environment, enhancing digitisation and strengthening infrastructure and connectivity.There has been a growing recognition of standards as a driver of trade and technical development. The commerce and industry ministry has been promoting use of international standards by Indian exporters, recently releasing a National Strategy for Standardisation. Adjusting to these standards will help firms tap international markets. In certain sectors &ndash; such as agriculture and food processing &ndash; the lack of compliance with standards has prevented exporters from penetrating markets such as the US, EU and Japan. Conformity with sanitary and phytosanitary measures will help Indian food products become globally acceptable.Global standards are continually evolving. In addition to compliance by Indian manufacturing firms, identification of specific standards and regulations across different sectors by industry bodies and relevant ministries will help India participate in global value chains. Indian firms should ensure they stay abreast of international developments in the space of standards and technical regulations. Conforming to changes in a timely manner plays a prime role in shaping market access of Indian goods and services.While the rest of the world is looking inwards, India needs to take a contrarian view and focus on exports by targeting large global markets. To drive its own development with vigour India needs to boost exports through promoting size and scale, ease the business environment and adjust to global standards. These measures will help India integrate with global value chains and achieve robust and sustained economic growth.DISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author's own.",

Similarly, digital ports expedite approvals and promote paperless clearances.Since 2011-12, India's exports have been hovering at around USD 300 billion. During 2017-18, the shipments grew by about 10 per cent to USD 303 billion.The new policy will replace the industrial policy of 1991 which was prepared in the backdrop of balance of payment crisis.It will also look to reduce regulatory hurdles and encourage adoption of frontier technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence.

            "articleBody": "The last revision in the base year was in 2006 by the Sixth Central Pay Commission to 2001 from 1982 NEW DELHI: After a Pay Commission bonanza of 2% hike in dearness allowance in March, central government employees and pensioners can expect another round of salary increase with the government set to modify the index and base year for calculating dearness allowance. The labour ministry is working on a new series of consumer price index for industrial workers (CPI-IW), which is used to determine dearness allowance (DA).DA is a cost of living adjustment allowance paid to government employees, public sector employees and pensioners in the country. It is calculated as a percentage of an employee&rsquo;s basic salary to mitigate the impact of inflation on people. A senior government official told ET that the labour bureau under the ministry has finalised the new CPI-IW with base year 2016. It is proposed that the base be revised every six years to capture the changes in living expenses more quickly, the official said. The existing CPI-IW has 2001 as the base year.The move is likely to benefit 11 million employees and pensioners. The last revision in the base year was in 2006 by the Sixth Central Pay Commission to 2001 from 1982.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new index will include addition of new industrial centres to make price gauze more representative, taking total number of industrial centres under consideration to 88 against 78 now, the official said. Several new items are being added to the list, including cars and mobiles, to reflect the change in lifestyle of industrial workers over the last 15 years. &ldquo;The trend so far is that the weightage of transport, healthcare and housing has gone up many fold in the new series in the monthly expenditure of an industrial worker, especially consumption of petrol and diesel with the addition of cars to it, while there is decline in overall food basket which is being diversified,&rdquo; the person said. With increase in fuel prices, cost of healthcare and housing, it is expected that there will be some increase in new index.Since this index is used to determine dearness allowance of all government employees and industrial workers there may be significant financial implication, running into crores of rupees with the revision in base year, the official said.The new index will soon go to the technical advisory committee for vetting, after which it will go to the national tripartite consultation before it is finalised, the official said. The labour bureau had taken approvals from standing tripartite committee at all stages development of the index, the official added.Based on the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, the Union Cabinet had in March this year increased DA to 7% from 5% effective January 2018, thus benefitting 48.41 lakh central government employees and 61.17 lakh pensioners.The combined impact on the exchequer on account of DA and DR (dearness relief) has been pegged at Rs 6,077 crore per annum and Rs 7,090 crore in 2018-19 (for 14 months from January 2018 to February 2019).",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut India&rsquo;s growth forecast by 10 basis points to 7.3% for the current year and by 30 basis points to 7.5% for 2019, citing faster-than-anticipated monetary tightening and higher crude prices.The international body had projected 7.4% and 7.8% growth for 2018 and 2019, respectively in its April forecast. India is still the fastest growing economy, well ahead of 6.6% and 6.4% growth for China. One basis point is one hundredth of a percent.Among emerging market and developing economies, growth prospects are also becoming more uneven, amid rising oil prices, higher yields in the United States, escalating trade tensions, and market pressures on the currencies of some economies with weaker fundamentals, as per IMF&rsquo;s update of the flagship World Economic Outlook (WEO).Forecast for global growth remains unchanged at 3.9% with oil producers gaining at the expense of consumers.&ldquo;The projection is 0.1 and 0.3 percentage point lower for 2018 and 2019, respectively, than in the April WEO, reflecting negative effects of higher oil prices on domestic demand and faster-than-anticipated monetary policy tightening due to higher expected inflation,&rdquo; the update noted.Anticipating inflationary risks, the Reserve Bank of India, in its June Monetary Policy meeting, hiked the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% for the first time in four-and-ahalf years.India&rsquo;s wholesale inflation touched a four-and-half year high of 5.77% in June. India's crude imports averaged $73.85 a barrel in June this year against $46.56 in June last year.&ldquo;Central banks in key emerging market economies &mdash; including Argentina, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey &mdash; have raised policy rates, responding to inflation and exchange rate pressures,&rdquo; the fund said.However, it said India&rsquo;s growth rate is expected to rise from 6.7% in 2017 as drags from the currency exchange initiative and the introduction of the goods and services tax fade. India&rsquo;s economy grew at a seven-quarter high of 7.7% in the three months ended March 2018, helped by higher government spending and investment.Last week, the World Bank said India had emerged as the world&rsquo;s sixth largest economy in 2017 with GDP of $2.59 trillion, surpassing France and is likely to go past the UK, which is at the fifth position.While the IMF has cut GDP growth forecast for India and Brazil, it has retained it for the United States, Russia, and China, the outlook for some oil exporters has strengthened.",

India became the world's sixth-biggest economy, pushing France into seventh place, according to updated World Bank figures for 2017 released on Wednesday. India's gross domestic product (GDP) amounted to $2.597 trilllion at the end of last year, against $2.582 trillion for France. Though ease of doing business has improved India would do well only after it manages to eliminate poverty, attract more investments in agriculture, meet the aspirations of the middle class, Jaitley said. The challenge now is to maintain 7 to8% growth amid global imbalances arising out of rising crude prices and trade wars which has put the currency under pressure. Jaitley suggested a uniform set of policies for the agriculture sector across the country so that farmers benefit the most and their income doubles.Agriculture is an area of concern for both the Centre and the states with both ending up making policies for the sector, according to Jaitley. He added that the same approach that helped roll out GST can be adopted in the case of farm policies as well.He also said that studies have shown that states which focused on the agriculture sector to help increase farm income have been re-elected and those who neglected this sector, have not come back to power.Earlier at the event, India&rsquo;s junior finance minister advised Nabard to step its support to farm producers&rsquo; organisation(FPO) to 5000 such organisations over the next two years to help government&rsquo;s initiative to double farm income by 2022.",

            "articleBody": "FILE - In this April 27, 2018 photo steel coils are stored at the Thyssenkrupp steel factory in Duisburg, Germany.Photo/Martin Meissner, file) BEIJING: China's aluminium exports exceeded half a million tonnes for only the second time ever in June while steel exports hit an 11-month high, as strong international prices and a weak yuan meant shipments continued to defy US tariffs.  China is the world's top producer of steel and aluminium, which have been subject to 25 percent and 10 percent import tariffs, respectively, in the United States, since March 23.  Its ability to keep exports of both metals buoyant even amid these tariffs is likely to frustrate Washington, which imposed the duties to protect U.S. industries and has called on China to rein in excess capacity.  Separate customs data on Friday showed China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as exports accelerated, potentially further inflaming a bitter trade row between the world's top two economies.  China's unwrought aluminium and aluminium product exports were 510,000 tonnes last month, worth 9.41 billion yuan ($1.41 billion), customs said..  That was up 10.9 percent from 460,000 tonnes a year ago and topped a revised 480,000 tonnes in May, previously the second-highest figure ever behind only the 542,700 tonnes exported in December 2014. July exports will remain high because of the weak currency and quiet domestic market, said Paul Adkins, managing director of consultancy AZ China. UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw said anecdotal evidence suggests U.S. companies are still buying aluminium from China - even with the tariffs - because U.S. smelters have not ramped up output. He noted aluminium prices in the United States and Europe were strong, whereas they had weakened in China. \"The arbitrage is open, there is metal available. All the factors are in place for that export trade to continue and obviously it has done,\" he said. U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminium producer Rusal have \"impacted metal availability\" in Europe, \"so that's certainly going to be drawing a bit of demand out of China,\" Shaw added. Meanwhile, China's steel product exports for June climbed 1.9 percent year on year to 6.94 million tonnes, their highest since July 2017. They also nudged up from 6.88 million tonnes in May amid higher output in the second quarter and stronger global prices. Richard Lu, an analyst at CRU in Beijing, noted that the direct trade volume for Chinese steel exports to the United States was \"very small,\" so the March tariffs had only a \"limited impact.\" On July 10, however, a range of steel and aluminium products were targeted in another list of tariffs that the United States has threatened to slap on $200 billion worth of goods from China, which has vowed to respond.

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: Ruling out a single rate GST, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian today pitched for a three rate structure going forward as revenues stabilise.He said Goods and Services Tax is a \"work in progress\" and there is a need for further simplification of rates with fewer exemptions and simpler policies.\"In India, we can never have one rate. I had recommended a standard rate and one for demerit good, one for low rate. I think, in India, the debate should be about 'why can't we have three', rather than 'why not one',\" Subramanian said at an NCAER event here.Under the GST regime, there are four rates -- 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent. Luxury and demerit goods are subject to cess on top of the highest slab.The single rate GST structure was advocated by Congress President Rahul Gandhi.Subramanian said since GST is a regressive tax, it won't be \"fair\" to have a single rate structure unless there are instruments to protect the poor who get hurt by rising costs.\"...I think over time we will see simplification. For example, once the revenue stabilises, 28 per cent can (be rationalised).... but the broader point I want to make is that why can't we have three (tax slabs). That's what we should ask for,\" said Subramanian.Union Minister Arun Jaitley too had dismissed the idea of a single rate GST as \"flawed\" saying that it can only work in a country where the entire population has 'similar and high' capacity to spend.Subramanian said that GST implementation \"has not been too bad\" in the first year of difficult implementation.\"My own view is the more you rely on carrot, and less you rely on sticks, you facilitate formalisation of economy. That's what I like about GST. It is not heavy handed. Its a kind of self policing,\" he said.GST, which subsumed over a dozen of local taxes, was rolled out on July 1, 2017.The CEA headed panel had in its report way back in 2015 had recommended a range for revenue-neutral rate (RNR) of 15-15.5 per cent for the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST), with a preference for the lower one.It also suggested a range of 'standard' tax rate of 17-18 per cent for bulk of goods and services, while recommending 12 per cent for 'low rate goods' and 40 per cent for demerit goods like luxury car, aerated beverages, pan masala and tobacco. For precious metal, it recommended a range of 2-6 per cent.Besides, Subramanian also said that India needs an independent fiscal council which brings out independent views on how government does accounting for public finances.\"One of the things we all were unanimously in favour of was a fiscal council. I think we need to get more independent people doing this (government accounting) with better access to data...People should have trust that everything is properly accounted for,\" he said. ",

            "articleBody": "BENGALURU: The Global Innovation Index (GII) has ranked India as the 57thmost innovative nation in the world. The country has improved its ranking from 60th position last year. India has been improving steadily since it was ranked 81st in 2015. Meanwhile, China improved its ranking from 22 in 2017 to 17 this year.GII is being developed by jointly Cornell University, the Parisbased business school Insead and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in Geneva. GII ranks 126 economies based on 80 indicators. It is now in its 11th edition, and has become a major input for policy-makers on innovation around the world. After a precipitous drop in 2014 and 2015, India has been steadily improving its GII ranking in the last four years. &ldquo;It is surprising that India is not ranked higher,&rdquo; says Francis Gurry, director general of WIPO. &ldquo;But there is a consistent trend now, and I expect the trend to continue.&rdquo;Although ranked at 57, India is a top performer in the lower middle income group, where it is ranked at 5th position. It is the most innovative country in its region of central and southern Asia. In the indicators that capture the quality of innovation inputs and outputs, India is ranked second after China in the lower and upper middle income group combined.Many Asian nations have been steadily improving their ranking over the last five years. Tokyo is at the top, and two of the top five clusters are in China. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s rise has been dramatic in the last six years,&rdquo; says Soumitra Dutta, professor at the Cornell Johnson School of Business, and a founder of GII. &ldquo;A lot of conversations on China were anecdotal but now its performance is showing up in data.&rdquo;Many of India&rsquo;s innovations are not easily captured in indicators. &ldquo;We have to evolve indicators which capture non-technological but game-changing innovations common in India,&rdquo; says RA Mashelkar, former director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and a member of the GII international advisory board.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Driven by buyouts, the fund inflows from private equity (PE) players and venture capitalists (VCs) jumped 46 per cent to cross the USD 15 billion-mark in the first half of 2018, said a report. The reporting period saw as many as 36 large deals worth USD 11.5 billion, which were mostly buyouts, making such deals the highest ever at USD 4.9 billion, or 32 per cent of all investments received, a report by EY said today. But exits stood higher, another record, at USD 5.5 billion, across 99 deals, on the back of a few large strategic and secondary exits even though open market deals were subdued due to market volatility. In terms of fund raising, it stood at USD 3 billion, a third of which was targeted at the real estate sector,it said. According to the EY's private equity deal tracker, \"H1 of 2018 recorded investments worth USD 15.2 billion across 351 deals, on the back of 36 large deals of value greater than USD 100 million, strong buyout activity and investments in infrastructure and real estate asset classes.\" Buyouts as a theme has become even stronger in 2018 and is on course to become a prominent facet of PE investing in the country, notes Vivek Soni, partner at EY India. He attributes this to the entry of large pension funds looking to invest directly into assets, which has provided a significant impetus to investments in the infra and realty asset classes. \"In our view, notwithstanding headwinds like high oil prices, falling rupee and potential of global trade wars, the first half performance on PE/VC investments, exits and fund-raising have been strong and appears to be well on course to surpass the record highs of 2017,\" he said. On a half yearly basis, investments rose 46 per cent to USD 15.2 billion and 19 per cent in terms of volume at 351 deals. In terms of value of investments, first quarter saw a growth of 89 per cent over Q1 of 2017 and the Q2 of 2018 recorded a 17 per cent growth over Q2 of 2017. Like last year, strong growth continues to be driven by large deals. There were 36 deals of value greater than USD 100 million aggregating USD 11.5 billion, against 20 deals worth USD 6.6 billion in H1 of 2017. With 23 deals, the second quarter saw the highest ever number of deals of value greater than USD 100 million in a given quarter. The largest deals include GIC, KKR, Omers and others investing USD 1.7 billion in HDFC for a 3.9 per cent stake and Macquarie's USD 1.5 billion buyout of NHAI road assets. Other large buyouts include Hindustan Infralog's (an NIIF-DP World joint venture) buyout of Continental Warehousing for USD 400 million, Brookfield's USD 384 million buyout of Equinox Business Park and Apax's USD 350 million buyout of Healthium Medtech. Another major growth driver was the buyouts. During the reporting period there were 22 buyouts worth USD 4.9 billion, surpassing value recorded in any of the previous years. The whole of 2017 saw 25 buyouts worth USD 3.3 billion and in 2016 there were 29 buyouts worth USD 3.9 billion. \"As a result, buyouts now account for 32 per cent of all investments received in H1, compared with 12 per cent in the whole of 2017,\" said the report. Sectorally, financial services lead the deal street with USD 4.2 billion across 74 deals, 25 per cent higher than last year. E-commerce was next in line, sustaining the renewed interest with USD 1.1 billion invested across 40 deals, almost twice the investments received last year. Exits grew 17 per cent by value at USD 5.5 billion despite a 24 per cent decline in volume to 99 from 131 deals, making it the best half-yearly show since 2009, mainly driven by a rise in strategic and secondary exits. Exits via strategic sale saw USD 1.3 billion changing hands through 23 deals, which is 3.6 times the value recorded last year, while exits through secondary sale saw USD 2.1 billion in 24 deals, highest ever half yearly value for secondary sales. The largest exit was Actis selling its stake in Ostro Energy to ReNew Power for USD 769 million, followed by TPG moving out of Vishal Mega Mart to the Partners Group and Kedaara for close to USD 769 million, which was also the largest PE/VC exit in the retail and consumer products sector in the country.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nNew Delhi: India's macroeconomic story is quite good, economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg told Deepshikha Sikarwar and Vinay Pandey in an interview. He added that the risks to the macro story and stability are far more manageable than ever. Edited excerpts:The chief economic adviser has said rupee should be allowed to depreciate. What is your view?Neither the Reserve Bank nor the government has any view about rupee or any level for the rupee. We have adopted a market system for determination of rupee value. It is the demand and supply for dollars vis-&agrave;-vis rupee which will set its value. I don&rsquo;t think therefore any expression made by anyone whether it should depreciate or appreciate has any reflection of the government&rsquo;s view about it. There are times, including the times now, when the demand for dollar goes up. The supply has gone down somewhat, due to the reversal to some extent in the FPI (foreign portfolio investor) flows, the requirement of oil payments becoming higher etc. So, this has changed the dynamics of demand and supply for dollars. The role of RBI is that there is no disorder, that there is no excessive volatility because the market tends to sometime overreact one way or the other.You have talked about FCNR (Foreign Currency Non Resident) accounts and the fact that we could even look at a sovereign bond issue. Is that on the agenda right now?What we have said is that the reserves (foreign exchange) are at a certain level. They are the primary defence available. At this moment, it does not appear necessary to bolster our reserves. But, if there is a certain kind of movement in oil prices, the requirement goes up or otherwise, the means of raising or bolstering our reserves remain available. Historically, we have raised FCNR-B &ndash; we have done it four times. Sovereign bonds are also an option which can be considered. Indian companies can raise more of masala bonds and other bonds etc. I don&rsquo;t think any decision has been made or is required now. The situation is reasonably comfortable, but we have to be alert to emergent situations. All these market instruments are available to a sovereign like India to take care of its needs, in case necessary.Oil has become a worry on two counts. One, prices are elevated. Two, supplies from Iran could face disruption. How do you see the situation?On oil, definitely there is a bit of uncertainty. Iran is an important supplier to us and is also an important global supplier. We will need to watch. Last couple of days market indication seems to be that market also doesn&rsquo;t see that Iranian oil will disappear from the market. That&rsquo;s why you see a certain kind of stability, though at somewhat higher level than about two weeks back.So, we are working on the worst-case scenario?We need to keep in mind &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s the more likely scenario.Has the macro situation become more challenging in the last year of this government? Can we still have a strong recovery with the given concern on fiscal situation, inflation, interest rate, rupee etc?Macro situation is never static. I don&rsquo;t think we have had any time when all the moving parts of the macro economy could be said to be settled. We are conscious of the challenge but at the same time our strength and ability to deal with those challenges is much greater and therefore the risks to macro story and stability in my judgement are far more manageable than ever. Our growth story is intact&ndash; there are shortages emerging now. The kind of passenger traffic you see at airports indicates the amazing demand for services, which would require investments. See the automobiles growth&ndash;40%-plus growth in a month. Many industries are saying the output gap has disappeared or it has reached 80-85% capacity utilisation and therefore they are now making plans for fresh investments. Inflation is affected by oil prices, and there is speculation about how MSP (minimum support prices) and other prices will spell out, but we have again got used to different temperature. Five percent now looks to us a very large inflation &ndash; very recently double digit was the norm. And for a developing economy like us, 4-5% inflation is necessary. It&rsquo;s not harmful. On the fiscal side, our taxes are doing reasonably well and our expenditure is under control. The markets are doing reasonably well despite some outflows. I think the macroeconomic story is quite good.Experts see MSP hike as a worry for fiscal deficit...There are several things finally on which the fiscal impact would depend. One, what are the price levels when the crops come. If they are higher than MSP then no impact. Second, what is the quantity which is offered for sale and purchase. This (sale/procurement) would take place October to December sometime. If those get sold between January and March at prices lower than purchase price then that&rsquo;s all which will be the final impact on the budget this year.It&rsquo;s fair to estimate that not much of what is bought will be sold by March. You would need to wait or the government may come up with alternate uses such as nutritional programmes, then it has a different implication. One can&rsquo;t make precise fiscal implications of MSP. On broader terms, I don&rsquo;t see this to be very large this year. Our food subsidy is in the range of Rs 1.51 lakh cr&ndash; compared with that, it will be a small fraction.The US actions on trade have emerged as the biggest worry for global growth. Is India worried?If you look at our basket of exports and imports and given those considerations, whether they are able to enforce on Iran and other things, for India it is not going to be very material. Second, in my judgement, it is more of a tariff war and not a trade war. US is putting some tariffs and others are also responding with higher tariffs. Higher tariffs, if they don&rsquo;t affect trade, then the implication is different. It&rsquo;s not on growth, it may not even be on trade that much, but more on cost to customer. But if it... becomes a trade war where trade is disrupted, you are not able to sell. Selling at a higher cost with tariffs is a different meaning than not being able to sell. So far it has not degenerated into a ban on trade. Higher tariffs may also provide incentives for domestic capacities (in the US) to go up, which may disrupt growth for exporters, but that depends on whether the domestic industry is able to make that fresh investment and scale up. It&rsquo;s not so easy to put up a new steel plant. You may also not be very certain that this kind of situation will continue for long. So, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so clear that how it would impact, but certainly it&rsquo;s a serious development. It may have potentially serious implications.A small hike in interest rates is almost certain. Is it as a climb to higher rates or just a step adjustment?I am more concerned about the bond yield rates and impact of various developments, including how repo rates are fixed by MPC (monetary policy committee). The yields are higher than what they were two months back, but have stabilised. The difference between inflation and the yield is quite high, so at about 3%, the real rate is very high. These kinds of high rates are not really justified by the fundamentals. These should correct better rather than going the other way, in that the repo rate increase will play some part but not significant.Why did the Air India disinvestment not work out?The Air India was offered as a viable entity with a running business, an ongoing entity with, in our judgement, a sustainable level of debt. It was to operate as a profitable entity right from the beginning. It was not carrying the baggage of the past.Its other subsidiaries, which are profitable, were also being offered for sale. It was structured in a way that, when AI was put up for sale, of 76%, it was along with sustainable debt, and the rest of the debt along with some of the physical assets was to be put in a separate SPV. Possibly, the interested parties did not see it that way or there was not enough clarity. There were some provisions which might have been construed as likely to create problems. Some people mention about the 24% block being retained by the government, whereas that was also skin in the game &ndash; we also have a stake in this, that was the whole logic. Going forward, the government would structure AI on the lines of what was proposed as a viable entity and then look for an appropriate time to attempt the matter again. Air India&rsquo;s total debt is unsustainable.",

            "articleBody": "Mumbai: A lower base in the previous year&rsquo;s quarter and likely good show by select companies in sectors such as automobiles, capital goods, FMCG, IT, and metals should help the Nifty 50 companies report a double-digit growth in aggregate sales and profits for the June 2018 quarter. According to the ET Intelligence Group&rsquo;s estimates, net sales is likely to increase by 12.1 per cent and net profit by 13.5 per cent year-on-year. Sales and profit will grow in double- digits for the fifth and third consecutive quarters, respectively.The corporate performance in the June 2018 quarter will get a leg up given relatively muted performance in the year-ago quarter. This was because of lower inventories of companies in the June 2017 quarter ahead of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1, 2017. Subsequently, net profit of the sample grew marginally by 1.8 per cent during the year-ago quarter on sales growth of 10 per cent while the operating profit fell by 1.3 per cent.Operating profit for the June 2018 quarter is likely to grow by 15 per cent, the highest growth in at least nine quarters. In addition, the operating margin is expected to improve by 180 basis points year-onyear to 20.2 per cent.For investors, the quarter will be crucial in deciding whether an overall turnaround will be in sight amid headwinds of strong crude oil prices, a weakening rupee, rising inflation and hardening interest rates.\n  \n\n\n\nSECTOR TRENDSAUTOMOBILESAuto companies are expected to report good numbers following sustained volume growth across the vehicle segments thanks to improving consumer sentiments, replacement demand and price increase. Auto volumes grew 13-60 per cent during the June quarter. A better operating leverage is likely to support operating margins of Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki and domestic operations of Tata Motors.BANKING AND FINANCEPrivate sector banks with relatively higher focus on corporate lending, including Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, are expected to report lesser amount of new non-performing assets considering their higher slippages in the previous quarter. This combined with rising retail book may help them to post a resilient performance.CAPITAL GOODSThe continued support from the government-funded projects is likely to support the earnings growth of capital goods companies. The trend in Larsen &amp; Toubro&rsquo;s order flow will be watched closely since the country&rsquo;s largest infrastructure company has earlier guided for 12-15 per cent growth in order flow on a higher base. PowerGrid is expected to maintain the ratio of project commission-to-capital expenditure above one.CEMENTCement prices were largely stable during the June quarter, which means companies may not be able to clock meaningful growth in realisations. Volume growth will be between 5 per cent and 18 per cent for large companies. Companies are expected to record 4-21 per cent year-on-year revenue growth.FMCGFor FMCG, numbers may not be strictly comparable due to destocking before the GST implementation in the previous June quarter. However, the positive trend shown by FMCG companies in the previous two quarters is likely to continue. Nifty companies HUL and Asian Paints are expected to deliver highteen sales growth, albeit on a low base, while ITC may report modest numbers as the year-on-year decline in cigarette volumes continues.ITSelect top IT companies including TCS, Infosys, and HCL Tech are likely to report 2-3 per cent growth in the dollar denominated revenue keeping the currency rates constant to the previous quarter&rsquo;s levels. The impact of unfavourable cross-currency rates between the euro, the pound, and the dollar may be partially offset by 4 per cent sequential drop in the average rupee rate against the dollar. The trend in digital revenue will be critical.METALSFerrous metal companies are likely to do better than non-ferrous counterparts unlike the previous few quarters, thanks to record high global steel spreads (excluding Europe). Non-ferrous companies will face the headwinds on the cost front, particularly coal, crude derivatives and alumina. Coal India is expected to do well with 15 per cent volume growth in the first three months of FY19.PHARMAPharma companies are likely to report strong double-digit growth for their Indian businesses, due to low base of the previous June quarter. The US business for pharma companies is likely to remain flattish to marginally positive due to lack of any meaningful launches. However, the Indian players will benefit from the rupee depreciation and see a double- digit operating profit growth in the US business.TELECOMTelecom companies are expected to report pressure on average revenue per user for voice and data segments. This may limit the scope for higher topline growth despite rising data usage.",

            "articleBody": "Thick black smoke rises from the chimneys of glue factories at Dakari village of Unnao district near Kanpur on Friday. The World Health Organisation global air pollution database has revealed that India has 14 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world in terms of Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 concentration, with Kanpur topping the charts. It said that nine out of 10 people in the world breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.Photo by Arun Sharma BEIJING: China's top steelmaking city Tangshan ordered companies in the steel, coke and coal-fired power sectors to meet ultra-low emissions targets, the latest effort to curb air pollution. Steel mills will be given until October to meet the targets, while coke producers and coal-fired power plants will have to meet them by September, according to a document issued by the Tangshan city government on Wednesday and reviewed by Reuters. Factories that fail to meet the emission targets by the deadline will be shut for rectification. Tangshan, a city in Hebei province, is home to 64 steelmakers and produced 91.2 million tonnes of crude steel in 2017, accounting for 11 percent of the country's total output. The city on Monday issued a plan to halve the number of its steel producers by 2020 and eliminate inefficient equipment to consolidate its steel sector and improve air quality. The document issued on Wednesday also said companies that pass the emission checks before October will either be exempted from or ordered to implement fewer production restrictions during the winter of 2019-2020. During the past winter, the city ordered steel mills to cut production by as much as 50 per cent to meet politically important smog targets. It then extended the curbs until November though at a lower rate of between 10 to 15 per cent. Tangshan also said it will offer some fiscal support to companies that install clean air equipment before the end of the year in order to meet the emissions target. \"The ultra-low emission upgrade situation will be included as a key focus of environmental inspections...Emission readings at companies will be open for public supervision,\" the document said. The Tangshan government declined to comment on the document.",

            "articleBody": "&ldquo;Pressure is being built to go in for panic reaction and to throw fiscal discipline to the winds.\" MUMBAI: The government does not intend to go easy on its fiscal deficit targets by easing taxes on fuel or by spending more during an election year. Union minister Arun Jaitley said on Tuesday that the government would stick to its fiscal deficit targets this year and not go in for panic reaction in response to crude oil prices or volatility in the foreign exchange market.Speaking at State Bank of India&rsquo;s 5th banking conclave Jaitley described the increase in international oil prices as `artificial&rsquo; and `transient&rsquo;. &ldquo;A large number of suppliers do not have the strength to hold on at that level of supplies. They also need revenues based on their oil resource and therefore our whole attitude must be one where we have restraint. We have patience and we have the economic strength to deal with it,&rdquo; said Jaitley.The Union minister&rsquo;s statement comes on the back of criticism that the government is profiteering through high taxes on petrol and diesel and there is growing pressure on the government to cut taxes on fuel.&ldquo;Pressure is being built to go in for panic reaction and to throw fiscal discipline to the winds. But the consequences of that will be a remedy worse than the problems,&rdquo; said Jaitley.Reiterating that there was no additional pressure on spending this year being an election year, Jaitley said that every year in India is an election year. The union minister also indicated that the pressure on the rupee was arising out of the trade war between US and China. He said that India having chosen to be part of global economy is impacted by it.&ldquo;Therefore, when China moderates its currency there is a significant impact on Asian economies and their currencies. We saw that in 2015 when the Chinese devalued their currency. For a couple of weeks, we found that the shake-up also impacted us. But because our fundamentals were strong, within a few weeks we were back on the normal range of where the rupee should be,&rdquo; he said.",

We will not go back on what we have reformed,\" he said.On the question whether the options of the Centre cutting excise duty or tapping ONGC were on the table, Pradhan declined to share details saying, \"I cannot discuss the solutions being considered&hellip; The government is sensitive&hellip; our commitment is to the poor and the middle class. We will not allow (fuel) prices to go beyond their reach,\" he said.Pradhan deflected the question on excise duty cut by repeating his pitch for bringing fuels under GST (goods and services tax) regime. \"There are two taxes on fuels. Excise is imposed by the Centre, and states have their own tax. In the federal structure, the Centre cannot impose its will on states. Again, each state sets its tax regime according to its economic needs. State taxes should be reasonable and responsible. I have been interacting with chief ministers, finance ministers on the issue. My gut feeling is that there is a realisation of the need to bring fuels under GST. It is for the GST Council to decide when,\" he said.Pradhan blamed spurt in crude, refined products and rupee exchange rates for the recent spurt in pump prices. \"Oil prices are not constant. So fuel prices cannot be constant. There has to be market pricing if we have to ensure long-term supplies to consumers,\" he said.",

The segments where job creation was substantial were electric, mechanical or general engineering products followed by building and construction industry, trading &amp; commercial establishments and textiles.The data clearly indicates that over half of the jobs created in organised sector in the country were in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat during the seven-month period till March this year.The first set of payroll data was released by the EPFO last month. Some of the experts had raised doubts over construing job creation from the statistics. They had said that this data does not reflect true job creation in the country as it includes job changes also by employees.The EPFO has uploaded the data with disclaimers that the data for most recent months are provisional as updation of employees records is a continuous process and are likely to be updated in subsequent months.The body also said that this is age-band wise data of all non-zero contributors that are registered under the EPFO during particular month.The estimates may include temporary employees whose contributions may not be continuous for the entire year, it added.The EPFO manages social security funds of workers in the organised/semi organised sector in India. It has more than 6 crore active members (with at least one month contribution during the year).",

            "articleBody": " NEW DELHI: India&rsquo;s economy will grow 7.3% in the current financial year and gain pace to 7.5% next year as the &ldquo;temporary drag&rdquo; from demonetisation and the goods and services tax fades away, Fitch Ratings forecast.The rating company reaffirmed India&rsquo;s &lsquo;BBB-&rsquo; rating with a stable outlook as it pointed to India&rsquo;s growth potential and lauded the Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s monetary management. Fitch said GST is an important reform that would support growth in the medium term when teething issues dissipate.&ldquo;India&rsquo;s five-year average real GDP growth of 7.1% is the highest in the APAC region and among &lsquo;BBB&rsquo; range peers. Growth has the potential to remain high for a substantial period of time, as convergence with more developed economies can be expected,&rdquo; Fitch said in a statement from Hong Kong. &ldquo;India has the highest mediumterm growth potential among the largest emerging markets.&rdquo;Fitch expects inflation to average close to 4.9% in FY19 and the RBI to start raising its policy repo rate next year from 6% currently as growth gains further traction.Monetary tightening could be brought forward, it warned, if government policies such as higher minimum support prices and increase in customs duty on certain products push up inflation expectations.&ldquo;The Reserve Bank of India is building a solid monetary policy record, as consumer price inflation has been well within the target range of 4% +/- 2% since the inception of the Monetary Policy Committee in October 2016,&rdquo; it said.India&rsquo;s relatively strong external buffers and the comparatively closed nature of its economy make the country less vulnerable to external shocks than many of its peers, Fitch said, taking note of the country&rsquo;s 30-rank rise in the World Bank&rsquo;s ease of doing business rankings.RATINGS ACTION&ldquo;India&rsquo;s rating balances a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with weak fiscal finances and some lagging structural factors, including governance standards and a still-difficult, but improving, business environment,&rdquo; Fitch said, justifying its decision to hold the ratings.Despite vastly improved macros, Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s have not upgraded India from the lowest investment grade rating. Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service raised India&rsquo;s rating one notch in November last year, after a gap of 14 years.&ldquo;Weak fiscal balances, the Achilles&rsquo; heel in India&rsquo;s credit profile, continue to constrain its ratings,&rdquo; Fitch said, pointing to fiscal slippage against budget targets.&ldquo;The government has reasserted its longer-term aim of gradual fiscal consolidation with an amendment of the FRBM Act (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act) to set a ceiling for central government debt at 40% of GDP and general government debt at 60% of GDP, to be reached by March 2025,&rdquo; it said of the new targets. &ldquo;This is a positive step towards a more prudent fiscal framework, if eventually adhered to.&rdquo;",

            "articleBody": "\n\nNEW DELHI: Fitch today projected India's economic growth to rise to 7.3 per cent next fiscal and further to 7.5 per cent in 2019-20.In its Global Economic Outlook report, the US-based agency forecast Indian economy to clock a growth rate of 6.5 per cent this fiscal, a tad lower than official estimates by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of 6.6 per cent. The economy grew 7.1 per cent in 2016-17.According to Fitch, the pick up in growth is likely as \"the influence of one-off policy-related factor which was dragging growth has now waned.\"It said the money supply recovered to its pre-demonetisation level in mid-2017 and is now increasing steadily, similar to the previous trend.Also, disruptions related to rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) in July 2017 have gradually diminished.Showing signs of recovery, the Indian economy hit a five-quarter high of 7.2 per cent in the October-December period on good show in key sectors like agriculture, construction and manufacturing.Fitch said the Budget for 2018-19 fiscal, beginning April, envisages a slower pace of fiscal consolidation and, therefore, should support the near-term growth outlook.It contains measures that will benefit low-income earners (such as a minimum price support and free health insurance) and support rural demand. The government also plans to ramp up infrastructure outlays, in particular by state-owned enterprises, the agency said.\"Those policies come on top of substantial road construction plans and a bank recapitalisation plan announced late last year, which should also provide some support to growth in the medium term,\" Fitch said.On inflation, Fitch said, accelerating food prices were the main cause of the pick-up in headline inflation. By contrast, fuel price increases have been contained by the government's decision to roll back excise duties to keep pump prices stable in the face of rising oil prices.\"We expect inflation to hover a bit below 5 per cent in 2018 and 2019, in the upper band of the Reserve Bank's target,\" it said.Fitch said it expects the Reserve Bank of India to start raising interest rates next year as growth gains further traction, while inflationary pressures should remain quite high.The minimum support price scheme for agricultural products and increased customs duties on certain products (such as electronics, textiles and auto parts) will boost prices against a backdrop of accelerating growth.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India's manufacturing sector growth eased slightly in February as factory output and new business orders rose at a slower pace, says a monthly survey.\n The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell from 52.4 in January to 52.1 in February, indicating a modest improvement in operating conditions.\n\nThis is for the seventh consecutive month that the index remained above the 50-point-mark that separates expansion from contraction.\n\nThe expansion was primarily driven by a significant rise in manufacturing production, while there were reports of improved underlying demand, with domestic and external sources driving new business gains.\n \"It was promising to see that India s manufacturing sector remained in growth territory, as the impact of July s Goods and Services Tax continues to dissipate,\" said Aashna Dodhia, Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.\n\nIn response to greater production requirements, firms raised their staffing levels during February. Although modest, the pace of job-creation was slightly faster than January.\n On the prices front, the survey said that cost inflation accelerated to the sharpest since February 2017, adding to expectations that inflationary risks will continue over the coming months.\nIHS Markit upgraded its CPI forecast to 5.2 per cent for financial year 2017-2018 amid a stronger oil price forecast and growing fiscal risks.\n\n\"Although companies were able to raise their average selling prices at the fastest pace in a year, inflation remained modest highlighting some customer sensitivity to price changes,\" Dodhia said.\n\nThe survey further noted that Indian manufacturers remained optimistic towards the 12-month outlook for output during February.",

            "articleBody": "India's economic recovery is expected to have gathered momentum and GDP growth is likely to grow at its fastest pace at 7 per cent in the December quarter as consumers, businesses and the government stepped up spending, say two reports from Morgan Stanley and Reuters poll.\n\nThe reports suggest that disruptions from a shock ban on high-value currency notes in November 2016 and the chaotic launch of a goods and services tax (GST) in July are fading.\n\nIndia's GDP grew by 6.3 per cent in July-September quarter of the fiscal, up from 5.7 per cent in the first quarter.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, growth in the industry and services sector is expected to have accelerated while growth in the agriculture sector decelerated.\n\n\"We expect the economic recovery to have gathered further momentum with GDP growth accelerating to 7 per cent year-on-year in the December-17 quarter from 6.3 per cent in the September quarter,\" Morgan Stanley said in a research note.\n\nIn GVA terms, growth picked up further to 6.7 per cent year-on-year from 6.1 per cent in the previous quarter, the brokerage said.\n\nAccording to the report, corporate revenue trends, which track industry gross value-added (GVA) growth closely, also improved further in the December quarter.\n\nMoreover, auto and two-wheeler sales posted robust growth in the December quarter beyond what was implied by favourable base effects, while goods exports growth improved further to double-digit levels, it added.\n\nIn the latest quarter, \"government spending was stronger and private consumption demand was robust as well, as seen in strong growth in auto sales,\" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities PD.\n\n\"Recent buoyancy in indicators such as cement output also points to recovery in segments such as construction, and real estate that were hit most from demonetization.\"\n\nStill, growth in the world's seventh largest economy is far from the near-double digits pace recorded during the years before the financial crisis.\n\nWhat has also weighed on the economy is exports, which took a hit last year from an appreciating rupee, which strengthened 6.5 percent against the dollar in 2017.\n\nWhile down around 1 percent this year, the rupee is not expected to weaken significantly, according to a separate Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists.\n\nCONCERN ON BANKING\nEconomists in the latest Reuters poll were also concerned about the increase in non-performing assets of state-run banks, and said if they are not handled effectively it would hurt economic activity.\n\nAdding to those worries, the second biggest state lender, Punjab National Bank this month revealed a loan fraud that's the biggest in India's banking history.\n\nThe fraud has cast a shadow over the workings of state-run lenders, already reeling from accumulated bad loans accumulated that are higher than those of banks in most major economies.\n\nWhile stress on bank balance sheets is a drag and the clean-up exercise \"may still take time\", it's likely that economic growth should get better, Upadhyay said.\n\nThe Reuters poll also predicted India's GVA increased 6.6 percent from a year earlier in October-December from a year earlier, compared to 6.1 percent in the prior three months.\n\nThat should provide some relief to the Reserve Bank of India which is performing a delicate balancing act of monitoring inflation and nurturing growth.\n\nRetail inflation eased in January after a 17-month spike in December, but was still above the 4 percent medium-term target of the central bank.\n\nWhile the RBI kept rates on hold at its February 7 meeting, the minutes showed monetary committee members concerned about the rising inflation rate.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters &amp; PTI)\n",

All economies will have to think differently and create their own roadmap for creating economies of scale and efficiency, as only this can lead to wealth creation, as has been done by China,&rdquo; Xie said at the Global Business Summit.&ldquo;The West is becoming a destabilising force. It is an unfortunate reality we have to live with for long,&rdquo; he said, speaking at a session on &lsquo;Froth in the Global Economy?&rsquo; Xie is a Shanghai-based independent economist specialising in China and Asia, and he writes, speaks and consults on global economics and financial markets.According to Xie, the key for all developing economies in East Asia is to trade among themselves to become richer.Commenting on the perceived bubble in the global financial markets he said the market will be volatile this year because it is not supported by liquidity.Xie said that the current bubble is building up largely because the US dollar is a reserve currency and it is being supported by currencies in East Asia, where production and savings happen.&ldquo;As a result their markets expand and they continue to buy dollars,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To burst this bubble Chinese currency has to go up. Unless China appreciates its currency other East Asian currencies will not go up.&rdquo;Managing economy with financial markets is not sustainable, Xie said. &ldquo;It will give you some growth but that will be for a short while and would not be big enough,&rdquo; he said. In 1997-98, the Hang Seng Index fell over 70% in a year. The S&amp;P 500 did something similar in 2000 and 2007.On the recent stock market downturn, Xie had earlier said that the real collapse would be much worse. &ldquo;The current stock market bubble is much greater than on those three occasions. When the real crash comes, it will be worse,&rdquo; he had said.",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley refuted former finance minister P Chidambaram&rsquo;s criticism of the budget and the government&rsquo;s economic management as he launched into a scathing comparison of the record of the two administrations.Jaitley reeled out numbers to show how the government had done better than the Congress-led administration in the last few years on growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, revenue deficit and current account deficit measures.India had gone from basket case to the world&rsquo;s brightest economy, Jaitley said, comparing the two periods. In the early years, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had benefited from a boom in the global economy, he said.The Indian economy, under BJP rule since 2014, has moved the country from policy paralysis to structural reforms. From being one of the fragile five, India has become a bright spot, he said.&ldquo;I do believe that some people can make very good comments at us because they write and speak with right logic but I am not so sure whether they make the best administrators,\" he said. &ldquo;In some cases, where you stand depends on where you sit,\" he said citing Congress&rsquo; shifting stand on Aadhaar, the GST and corporate tax between when it was in power and now, when it is in the opposition.\"What is the consistency of your stand on economic policy?\" he asked.Answering the questions Chidambaram posed in his speech on the budget on Thursday, Jaitley said when the pre-budget Economic Survey spoke of the remaining work in agriculture, employment and education sectors, it did not mean the problem was created in the last four years but implied the task left unfinished by 55 years of Congress rule.&ldquo;The work is still pending a lot and this is the real reality. We are not living in the air castle,&rdquo; he said.Referring to Chidambaram's quip that the chief economic adviser, the author of the Economic Survey, was a very good doctor but the government was a terrible patient, he said even a bad patient ends up being cured if there is a good doctor.\"For those 10 years, 2004-2014, you had a terrible doctor. And when you have a terrible doctor, even the healthiest of the patients are likely to disappear,\" he said of the 10 years of the Manmonhan Singh government.Of his government&rsquo;s rule he said, \"That's the journey of transformation. And therefore we can throw up questions in the air and live under the illusions of all sorts of know-alls. But the fact is, our analysis can be incorrect (but) data cannot speak any alternate language.\"Jaitley said GDP growth under UPA rule in 2012-13 was 5.3% &mdash; the lowest in recent years &mdash; and it was 6.3% in the following year.&ldquo;We lost one quarter GDP because of GST, because people were destocking (and) manufacturing came down and it became 5.7%. So, for one quarter it was 5.7%. So, there was so much of hoopla for one quarter as compared to 5.3% to 6.3% for two full years under UPA,&rdquo; he said.During UPA rule, the current account deficit broke the \"world record\" at 6.8% and was at 4.2% and 4.8% in its last two years, he said, adding that under BJP it was \"half a percent, 1%, 1.5%\" range.&ldquo;And we are hearing the music about what you are doing about CAD,\" he said. Fiscal deficit in the last three years of UPA rule was 5.9%, 4.9% and 4.5% and in contrast the fiscal deficit under BJP rule came down to 4.1% in the first year, 3.9% in the second and 3.5% in the third.\"This year we were to reach 3.2% but we remained at 3.5% because of the apparent reason\" that GST revenue in the current fiscal will be short by one month, he said. This is a \"statistical slippage of the fiscal deficit\".\"Maintaining fiscal deficit as high as 5.9 %, you are today lecturing us as to why you didn't bring it down to 3.2 %,\" he said. Inflation rate was over 9% in the last three years of UPA, he said as he pointed to much lower inflation under NDA.",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The partnership between Japanese carmakers Toyota and Suzuki will roll out a small electric car for the mass segment in India and elsewhere by 2020, an industry executive said. The car is likely to be manufactured at Suzuki&rsquo;s plant in Gujarat, the person told ET on condition of anonymity. Japan&rsquo;s largest carmaker Toyota Motor Corporation also plans to electrify 80% of its portfolio by 2022, the person said. Akito Tachibana, managing director at Toyota&rsquo;s Indian subsidiary Toyota Kirloskar, said the company will have a range of electrified solutions in the future. He expects hybrid vehicles &mdash; which combine conventional fuel-powered engine with an electric motor to improve fuel efficiency &mdash; to play a significant role in India&rsquo;s drive to meet its emission commitments. &ldquo;Keeping Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulation (fuel efficiency norms in the US) in mind, a small EV (electric vehicle) is a best boy but for larger segments hybrid vehicles are ideal,&rdquo; Tachibana told ET in an interview. He urged the government to come out with a long-term policy that promotes hybrids. &ldquo;We need to know what is the intent of the government, is it cutting down on imports of oil, or, is it meeting the CO2 regulation, or reducing emissions?&rdquo; he said. \n\t\n\n\n\nHe said hybrid vehicles are 45% more fuel efficient than the conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs). &ldquo;Going ahead, all fuels will have a role to play,&rdquo; Tachibana said. &ldquo;Diesel and petrol have their pros and cons, but hybrids are ideal to meet both reducing emission and improving efficiency.&rdquo; He declined to share the number of hybrids Toyota Kirloskar plans to have in the near future, but said the company has initiated an internal study to find &ldquo;who is the buyer of EV&rdquo; by 2020, given that challenges of infrastructure, range and battery costs still persist. He did not confirm the plan to roll out a small EV through Toyota&rsquo;s partnership with Suzuki, but said rebadging is not an issue.",

This will require substantially increasing the share of renewable energies as well as improving energy efficiencies.\"You cannot stop the technology's aggressive landing. Digitalisation, Internet of Things, 3-D printing and artificial intelligence will soon mechanise the energy sector. Industry 4.0 will cause disruption the energy sector as well, like in healthcare and education,\" said Pradhan.Gurdeep Singh, Chairman and Managing Director of NTPC Ltd and Member Secretary of World Energy Council India, said the opportunities and challenges arising from Energy 4.0 and energy transition transcend long-established sector boundaries defined by coal, oil and gas sectors.During the conference, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar invited suggestions from industry leaders as the think- tank embarks to prepare India's integrated energy policy along with a national plan for the manufacturing sector to adopt new technologies like artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT).\"This is an era of pro-sumers - producers who are consumers as well - and with Industry 4.0, manufacturing is witnessing the biggest disruption ever seen in history. The integration of conventional fuels and renewable energies will determine a whole panorama of future public services,\" he said.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nBy V SriramThe Budget 2018 has evoked mixed reactions from various stakeholders. While it has disappointed many tax payers, the Budget packs a punch for the core sectors of the economy, especially agriculture and infrastructure.It&rsquo;s mainly a pro-agrarian Budget, with sops and initiatives to strengthen and develop the agriculture sector. At the same time, there were interesting measures to drive growth through job creation, thrust on MSMEs and infrastructure.Empowering the agriculture sector: The backbone of Indian economy, agriculture has been the focus of this Budget. Raising the Minimum Support Price (MSP) offered to farmers for crops, increased resources to irrigation and aquaculture projects, allocating Agriculture market fund of Rs 2,000 crore are likely to give the desired boost to this sector. Additionally, 100 per cent tax deduction has been provided to companies registered as farmer-producer companies with turnover of Rs 100 crore and above. Ensuring better healthcare for the poor: Spending on healthcare is not only a burden on the financial resources of the poor but also adversely impacts their earning capacity thus resulting in a double whammy on the poor. As pointed out in the Economic Survey announced recently, the Out of Pocket Expenditure (OoPE) on health remains high at 62 per cent of the total health expenditure. The proposed health insurance scheme covering 10 crore families is a step in the right direction and will help in ameliorating the hardship of the poor. Infrastructure sector continues to attract higher allocation: The total Infrastructure outlay increased from an estimated expenditure of Rs 4.94 lakh crore in 2017-18 to almost Rs 6 lakh crore, in an effort to aid employment and growth. With a view to enhance the carrying capacity of the Railways and ensuring passenger safety, capex for railways is fixed at nearly Rs 1.50 lakh crore for 2018-19.Focus on MSMEs for generating growth &amp; employment: The MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise) sector is a pillar of the economy, contributing about 45 per cent to manufacturing output and 40 per cent to exports. This sector has been rightly given due attention, being promised quick loans for resource access and employment generation. Further, lower tax rate of 25 per cent has been proposed to companies with a reported turnover up to Rs 250 crore. The proposed target of 3 lakh crore for lending under MUDRA is expected to give a boost to the sector. Strengthening the bond market: A strong bond market helps in economic growth of the nation. The government has asked Sebi to consider mandating large companies to raise 25 per cent of their debt from the bond markets. Further, it&rsquo;s proposed to consider corporate bonds with &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade ratings as eligible for investment, as opposed to the current practice of considering only &lsquo;AA&rsquo; rating eligible for investing by most regulators. This would have an impact on all investment funds such as pension funds, insurance funds and mutual funds which invest in corporate bonds across different schemes.Overall, this Budget is a laudable attempt by the government to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth as the country braces to become an economic powerhouse.(V Sriram is Chief Operating Officer at ICRA Management Consulting Services.

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Agriculture income may fall by up to 25% in the medium term because climate change will hit crop yields, making it imperative to replace power and fertiliser subsidies by direct income support and to drastically expand irrigation, the Economic Survey said.Agriculture accounts for 16% of gross domestic product and 49% of employment in India, making it crucial in the overall economy, the survey said. \"Poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, farmer distress and unrest, and larger political and social disaffection &mdash; all of which can hold back the economy.\"In recent years, farmers have suffered because of erratic monsoon rains, unseasonal showers on the eve of harvest and volatile prices, which at times dipped below the support price because of large stocks and good harvests. Lower yields because of high temperature and low rainfall due to climate change will add to their distress.The survey said the impact of climate change on agriculture was already visible. \"The government&rsquo;s laudable objective of addressing agricultural stress and doubling farmers&rsquo; incomes consequently requires radical follow-up action, including decisive efforts to bring science and technology to farmers, replacing untargeted subsidies (power and fertiliser) by direct income support, and dramatically extending irrigation but via efficient drip and sprinkler technologies,\" it said.Industry leaders and experts welcomed the suggestions.\n\t\n\n\n\n US Awasthi, the managing director of fertiliser cooperative Iffco, said the government should in the budget announce direct transfer of fertiliser subsidies to farmers instead of giving subsidies to the industry. \"This will free the farmer to buy fertiliser according to his requirement. It will also help in propagating the balanced use of fertilisers and use of micro nutrients,\" he said.The direct benefit transfer (DBT) for fertiliser subsidy was launched on a pilot basis in October 2016. Under this, the entire subsidy on various fertiliser grades is released to fertiliser companies on the basis of actual sales made by retailers to the beneficiaries.\n\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n However, Sukhpal Singh, the director-general at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development in Chandigarh, said DBT was relevant in areas where there was leakage of subsidies and where small farmers were unable to avail of it as in power subsidy and food subsidy.The survey said certain crops faced a greater risk from climate change than others. \"The clear pattern that emerges is that crops grown in rain-fed areas, pulses in both kharif and rabi, are vulnerable to weather shocks while the cereals, both rice and wheat, are relatively more immune.\"It estimated that in a year when temperatures are 1 degree higher, farmer incomes would fall by 6.2% during the kharif season and 6% during rabi in unirrigated areas. Similarly, in a year when rainfall is 100 mm less than average, incomes would fall by 15% during kharif and by 7% during the rabi season.\"Applying IPCC-predicted temperatures and projecting India&rsquo;s recent trends in precipitation, and assuming no policy responses, give rise to estimates for farm income losses of 15% to 18% on average, rising to 20-25% for unirrigated areas,\" the survey said. \"At current levels of farm income, that translates into more than Rs 3,600 per year for the median farm household.\"",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: There is robust and broad-based revival in the Indian economy that coexists with macroeconomic challenges, chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, who presented the Economic Survey 2017-18 on Monday, said at an interaction. Edited excerpts:ON FISCAL CONSOLIDATIONThis has been an unusual year because of demonetisation and GST. This is well known... There are no surprises... If activity is picking up, inflationary pressure is mounting. You would say that you should actually have a pretty healthy consolidation. So that is what the cycle would dictate for next year. However, you also have to take into account the fact that you can&rsquo;t make promises which are difficult to meet. Cycle (economic) calls for ambitious consolidation, but the political cycle calls for more modest consolidation.ON INTEREST RATESThe Indian economy could have for about a period of 18 months benefited from lower interest rates, in the period when we had really high real interest rates and the economy was weak. But, now clearly the cycle has turned, inflationary pressures have re-emerged. So, stance of monetary policy naturally has to change.ON CAPITAL MARKETSThe broader point is that we have seen around the world that when asset prices go up very much they always tend to come back and so we have to be watchful. The higher prices go, our vigilance should increase correspondingly. Indian stock market boom is very different and make no mistake because it reflects a massive portfolio reallocation by investors, households away from gold, financial savings and real estate into stocks. Part of the reason this happened is because of policy actions, so this makes the Indian stock market very interesting but also that has to be monitored very carefully. (He refrained from calling it a bubble).ON RISING CRUDE OIL PRICESWe had thought that oil would not go above $55-60 per barrel. We have been proven wrong on that and we should admit that. There are two things that have contributed to that. We thought shale oil would come back to $50-55. So far it has not come back to the same extent we wanted to because shale producers are now more concerned about profit margins than expanding activity. It was completely unforeseeable thing. The ARAMCO listing is making oil prices much higher than they otherwise should be. I don&rsquo;t want to get into geopolitics of that, but that&rsquo;s what has contributed to that. The government is committed to its policy of deregulation. We know the rule of thumb: For every $10 increase in oil prices, GDP growth comes down by 0.2% to 0.3%, the current account deficit will deteriorate by 0.4% of the GDP, or $10 million. Inflation will also be higher by 0.2% to 0.3%. So, I think we need to watch oil prices very carefully.ON ADDITIONAL BORROWINGWhatever the borrowing that has been done by the Centre and especially the states, the market has misinterpreted. In the case of the states, for example, this year about Rs 40,000 crore is going to be financed through market borrowings. This is not financing new deficit, but just a change in financing away from NSSF (National Social Security Fund) towards market borrowing and that is not new deficit. That underlying borrowing that happened reflects a certain deficit, over and above that markets have potentially misinterpreted, especially what the states have been doing.ON UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOMEThere is a lot of discussion going on about UBI&hellip; I can bet within the next two years, at least one or two states will implement UBI. (Subramanian in the Economic Survey 2016-17 had mooted the idea of universal basic income that guarantees all citizens enough income to cover their basic needs and would be easier to administer than the current anti-poverty schemes, which are plagued by waste, corruption and abuse.)ON GROWTHThere is robust and broad-based revival in the Indian economy. The direction is very good, but the growth is still below potential. When we give a range between 7 and 7.5%, it is because there are factors working both ways. Unless we get more data I don&rsquo;t want to assign probabilities to where we are going to be. There is a story of revival and that of macro challenges &mdash; both coexist. In a sense, the current macroeconomic conjecture is about both the story of revival and the story of risks. This duality of revival and risk, in some ways, reflects the current state of macroeconomic policy... If you look at the last four quarters, you will see that manufacturing export growth is about 11.3%, which is very healthy and broadly in line with where the world economy is going. So exports are driving growth, the temporary factors are receding. Private investment going forward will depend a lot on capacity utilisation and the progress under the Insolvency and Banking Code. Consumption is going to be a bit of a challenge due to rising oil prices going forward.ON DISINVESTMENTLet&rsquo;s always keep aside fiscal motivation for disinvestment and the real underlying efficiency reason for the same. I think that there is a strong case for underlying efficiency, or just stopping the bleeding. The government is aware of this&hellip;NITI Aayog came up with a list of recommendations.I think this is a classic dilemma: if PSUs are doing well you say it is national wealth, and when you are not doing well it is difficult to disinvest. The principle that we should expand strategic disinvestment for underlying micro efficiency reasons are compelling. Unviable banks have to be shrunk and (there should be) much more private sector participation in good banks.ON AGRICULTUREClimate change is a medium-term challenge. This year there are three or four distinct things that are going on in agriculture. We have actually seen a reduction in acreage under sowing both in kharif and rabi. It is not your typical surplus leading to large decline in prices. For some other crops, there have been a reduction in production. So, we need to have mechanism that would protect farmer against the downside.Last year we tried to do that in pulses with more effective procurement, effective changes in marketing, (and) post agriculture warehousing. Wage growth has not decelerated; it used to be at 7-8% until a few months ago but this year because the sowing has come down the demand of labour has come down.ON SINGLE GST RATEOver some horizon &mdash; may be 3-5 years &mdash; we can think, in principle, of having one rate, because we see the benefits of that are so compelling. In the short run, there is a case for simplification and greater rationalisation.ON GST COLLECTIONSYou are going to see a big increase over time both in people who are not paying enough and new filers. The process of compliance is going to improve quite substantially. For such a disruptive change and teething challenges, collections have been very reasonable, almost robust.",

            "articleBody": " NEW YORK: India has the potential to achieve 10 per cent growth rate, but it needs major reforms in areas in labour laws and land acquisition, former Niti Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya has said.He said Indian economy grew 7.5 cent in the first three years of the Narandra Modi government, but two major reforms - demonetisation and goods and services tax - brought the growth rate down a little.In the current fiscal, he said, India will end up at 6.5 per cent, which is also a pretty good growth rate.\"By all accounts, I have no doubt that (India) will get back to eight per cent plus (growth rate). India really today is probably the only game in the town,\" the professor of economics at the prestigious Columbia University said while addressing the inaugural \"New India\" lecture series, launched by the Consulate General of India here.The \"New India\" lecture series is inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a new India by 2022. It is an initiative of Indian Consul General Sandeep Chakrabarty.He said that although China is probably growing at 6-7 per cent but its rate us likely to decline to five in the years to come.Panagariya said that India will sustain its high growth rate for the next two decades at least with the current trajectory of reforms, unless it starts making mistakes again.He also said that India is headed to become the world's fifth largest economy and there was no doubt that the country has got the potential to do 10 per cent.\"Certainly, there is no doubt that we have got the potential to do 10 per cent.\"For India to achieve the double-digit growth, the country needs major reforms in labour and land acquisition laws. It also needs significant privatisation and a major reform of civil service, which is quite not sufficient to handle the large economy that India is now,\" Panagariya said.To a question on next budget, the former Niti Aayog Vice Chairman said that the next budget is unlikely to be different from the previous budgets.\"It would be reform-oriented budget in my view. I think there is a lot of talk about reaching the fiscal consolidation plan. Expecting that the budget will give clear indication of reforms,\" he said, adding that the agriculture sector could see more emphasis in the upcoming budget.Refuted the notion that there was a large-scale unemployment in India, Panagariya said \"Unemployment in India is not very high. Jobs are being created, but as the way policies were being adopted in India, in the end it gives very little incentive to employers to employ people in the formal sector.\"\"This is a long standing problem in India.\"Panagariya said he enjoyed his three-year term in India as the Vice Chairman of Niti Aayog, and he would have stayed longer, if he did not have a permanent job at the Columbia University or the varsity would have given him a longer leave.He described as \"scandalous\" a number of loans being given without any collaterals.\"It is scandalous. What kind of culture are we promoting? Absolutely unforgivable If one looks at the banks situation, default by the farmers are relatively small.\"The problems are all coming from large industrialists, but this government is not letting them go. This government is very tough...The Prime Minister is very tough on the corruption issue,\" he said.",

            "articleBody": "\n\nBy Mary Hallward-Driemeier &amp; Gaurav NayyarThe global economy is undergoing profound change.New technologies are impacting prospects for manufacturing-led development that has brought rapid prosperity to many parts of the world. Today, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing and the Internet of Things (IoT) are reducing the importance of low-wage labour.There is concern that Industry 4.0 &mdash;where data and automation in &lsquo;smart&rsquo; factories transform traditional manufacturing &mdash; may make it feasible for leading firms to re-shore manufacturing back to advanced economies, and closer to final consumers. China, too, is automating rapidly and is projected to be the world&rsquo;s largest user of industrial robots by 2018.The en masse migration of labourintensive manufacturing activities to poorer economies with lower labour costs such as India may, therefore, not occur. How, then, can India compete?The growth of manufacturing in India has been modest &mdash; with its share in GDP largely unchanged over the last two decades &mdash; especially when compared to the services sector. Globally, too, while India&rsquo;s share in global manufacturing production increased from 1.1% in the early 1990s to 2.8% in 2015, China&rsquo;s galloped from less than 5% to 25%.Even so, India has made greater progress in some manufacturing sectors. For example, since 1995, it has ranked among the top 10 exporters of labour-intensive goods such as textiles, apparel and leather products, jumping to fourth place in 2011.India has also maintained its comparative advantage in the export of pharmaceuticals and a range of commodity-based manufactures over the last two decades.Although the criteria for becoming amanufacturing hub are now changing, some manufacturing industries are likely to remain relatively unaffected by Industry 4.0. This includes a range of commodity-based manufactures &mdash; basic metals, wood products, paper products and food processing &mdash; which are also less traded and, therefore, subject to less international competition. They will remain feasible entry points for India.Go Hell for LeatherIndia can also remain competitive, at least for some time, in its traditionally strong areas such as the productionof textiles, apparel and leather products, which is the least automated subsector so far &mdash; as long as it combines low wages with other reforms that enable it to compete.India&rsquo;s nascent success in the export of autos and electronics may, however, be harder to scale up. The use of robots in these industries is more widespread. They require closely clustered suppliers that can provide inputs on just-in-time basis, tilting the balance in favour of established manufacturing centres.India&rsquo;s large domestic market is an asset. Foreign direct investment (FDI) to manufacture in India for India may, therefore, be less influenced by cost considerations associated with establishing export platforms. The large market will also likely continue to provide room for the domestic manufacture of lower-price goods.Take, for example, India&rsquo;s two-wheeler auto sector, which has withstood international competition by producing low-cost, durable scooters and motorcycles with ubiquitous distribution and service networks. The scope for productivity gains may be even greater for lower-price goods where India can exploit opportunities beyond the domestic market. The country&rsquo;s exports of pharmaceuticals and three-wheeler scooters to other lower-income economies, especially in Africa, is a case in point.Notwithstanding these opportunities, the heightened global competition resulting from automation technologies will raise the bar for success in export-led manufacturing. India must, therefore, prepare now to remain relevant. If it can integrate its growing labour force with substantial improvements in the business environment, logistics and other backbone services, regulatory requirements, and so on, this may reduce the incentive for firms to relocate to higher-income countries with Industry 4.0 technologies.Yet, if there is a limited window to industrialise using older technologies, reforms that improve the country&rsquo;s competitiveness and connectedness acquire greater urgency. India&rsquo;s recent rise to the top 100 in the Doing Business rankings is a step in this direction.But there is more distance to cover.Similarly, India&rsquo;s restrictions on trade in services &mdash; many of which are increasingly embodied and embedded in manufactured goods &mdash; are among the highest in the world and will need to be eased.To prepare for &lsquo;smart&rsquo; manufacturing, the diffusion of new technologies will require higher-order skills, better information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, astronger intellectual property rights (IPR) regime, and complementary professional services. Since developing the capabilities of workers, firms and supporting institutions is likely to be a gradual process, India must start planning now.No Rocket ScienceHere, too, the country can leverage some of its unique strengths. First, its world-class institutes of higher learning in engineering and management sciences have created pockets of skilled labour that can respond to changing industry demands. Second, India&rsquo;s vast diaspora in the science and technology space can facilitate the transfer of technology and skills.Third, with the increasing &lsquo;servicification&rsquo; of manufacturing &mdash; where the use of data will play an increasingly important role in optimising processes &mdash; India&rsquo;s success in software services can lay the ground for the greater integration of such services into production.Hallward-Driemeier and Nayyar are senior economic adviser and senior economist, respectively, World Bank, Washington DC",

Therefore we are preparing a detailed plan what will be going in that manufacturing,\" Prabhu said at an event organised by internet firms body IAMAI.He said that experts who are involved into manufacturing are preparing the roadmap and including all sectors where manufacturing can be promoted.The minister said if manufacturing alone is digitised it will create huge opportunity for technology firms.\"60 per cent of the $5 trillion will come from services. This includes various services which are not being even thought of at present. Like home care services have tremendous scope,\" he said.The minister said that $3 trillion may be under statement as per the plan being worked out and there are empirical evidences to back it.Prabhu said as commerce and industries minister, he is working on a strategy for international trade which will contribute $2 trillion to the economy where contribution can come from both manufacturing and services.International trade should become a driving factor for the growth of GDP, he said.\"India is not only bridging digital divide but also helping people scale up their income,\" Prabhu said.He said that another revenue contribution to the economy will be farming sector where lot of transformation can be done.",

Chinese manufacturing activity expanded in October at a slower pace than the previous month as output weakened on softer demand in the world's No. 2 economy, an official survey said Tuesday, Oct. 31. (Chinatopix via AP) New Delhi/Geneva: The World Economic Forum (WEF) has ranked India at 30th position on a global manufacturing index -- below China's 5th place but above other BRICS peers, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. Japan has been found to have the best structure of production in the Geneva-based WEF's first 'Readiness for the future of production report' and is followed by South Korea, Germany, Switzerland, China, Czech Republic, the US, Sweden, Austria and Ireland in the top 10. Among BRICS nations, Russia is ranked 35th, Brazil 41st and South Africa at 45th place. The report, which analyses development of modern industrial strategies and urges collaborative action, has categorised 100 countries into four groups -- Leading (strong current base, high level of readiness for future); High Potential (limited current base, high potential for future); Legacy (strong current base, at risk for future); or Nascent (limited current base, low level of readiness for future). India has been placed in the 'Legacy' group along with Hungary, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, Thailand and Turkey, among others. China figures among 'leading countries', while Brazil and South Africa are in 'nascent' ones. The 25 'leading' countries are in the best position to gain as production systems stand on the brink of exponential change, the WEF said in the report published ahead of its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland later this month. At the same time, no country has reached the frontier of readiness, let alone harnessed the full potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in production. About India, the 5th-largest manufacturer in the world with a total manufacturing value added of over USD 420 billion in 2016, the WEF said the country's manufacturing sector has grown by over 7 per cent per year on average in the past three decades and accounts for 16-20 per cent of India's GDP. \"Home to the second-largest population in the world and one of the fastest growing economies, the demand for Indian manufactured products is rising. \"India has room for improvement across the drivers of production, except for demand environment where is ranks in the top 5,\" the WEF said. It listed human capital and sustainable resources as the two key challenges for India and said the country needs to continue to raise the capabilities of its relatively young and fast-growing labour force. This entails upgrading education curricula, revamping vocational training programmes and improving digital skills, the WEF said, while adding that India should continue to diversify its energy sources and reduce emissions as its manufacturing sector continues to expand. It also took note of the government's 'Make in India' initiative to make the country a global manufacturing hub and of \"a significant push\" to improve key enablers and move towards a more connected economy with announcement of a USD 59 billion investment in infrastructure in 2017. In terms of scale of production, India has been ranked 9th, while for complexity it is at 48th place. For market size, India is ranked 3rd, while areas where the country is ranked poorly (90th or even lower) include female participation in labour force, trade tariffs, regulatory efficiency and sustainable resources. Overall, India is ranked better than its neighbours Sri Lanka (66th), Pakistan (74th) and Bangladesh (80th). Other countries ranked below India include Turkey, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Mauritius and the UAE. The countries ranked better than India include Singapore, Thailand, the UK, Italy, France, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Israel, the Netherlands, Denmark, the Philippines and Spain. In a separate list of the countries best positioned to capitalise on the fourth industrial revolution to transform production systems, the US has been ranked on the top, followed by Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the Netherlands in the top five. India has been ranked 44th on this list, while China is at 25th place and Russia at 43rd. However, India is ranked better than Brazil (47th) and South Africa (49th). The report has been developed in collaboration with A T Kearney and calls for new and innovative approaches to public-private collaboration are needed to accelerate transformation. \"Every country faces challenges that cannot be solved by the private sector or public sector alone. New approaches to public-private collaboration that complement traditional models are needed to help governments quickly and effectively form partnerships that unlock new value,\" it added.\n",

            "articleBody": " New Delhi: India hit back on Monday at Washington's latest legal assault on its solar power policies at the World Trade Organization, rejecting a U.S. legal claim and exploring possible new protection of India's own solar industry.Last month the United States triggered a new round of litigation at the WTO, arguing that India had failed to abide by a ruling that it had illegally discriminated against foreign suppliers of solar cells and modules.In a statement published by the WTO on Monday, India said it had changed its rules to conform with the ruling and that a U.S. claim for punitive trade sanctions was groundless.\"India underscores that the United States' request is not a valid request,\" the Indian statement said.It said Washington had skipped legal steps, failed to follow the correct WTO procedure, and omitted to mention any specific level of trade sanctions that it proposed to level on India, leaving India \"severely prejudiced\".India would be vindicated if the proper process was followed, it said.\"In view of the above, India strongly objects to the U.S. request of 19 December 2017,\" it said.Renewable energy has become an area of severe trade friction as major economies compete to dominate a sector that is expected to thrive as reliance on coal and oil dwindles.India unveiled its national solar programme in 2011, seeking to ease chronic energy shortages in Asia's third-largest economy without creating pollution.But the United States complained to the WTO in 2013, saying U.S. solar exports to India had fallen by 90 percent. The WTO judges agreed that India had broken the trade rules by requiring solar power developers to use Indian-made cells and modules.In a separate move that could protect its solar industry from global competitors, not only U.S. rivals, India told the WTO last week that it was considering the case for imposing temporary emergency tariffs on solar cells, modules and panels, after a petition from the domestic industry.So-called safeguard tariffs are permitted by the WTO if there is evidence of serious harm, or threat of serious harm, to a country's production from a sudden, unforeseen surge in imports.India said the market share of imports had increased from 86 percent in 2014-15 to 90 percent in 2017-18, with growing losses for Indian producers and a fourfold rise in inventory levels.That amounted to prima facie evidence of serious injury to Indian firms, India said in the WTO filing.

The output growth for the month under review is highest since October 2016, when these core sectors had witnessed 7.1 per cent rise. These eight industries -- coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity -- had witnessed a growth of 3.2 per cent in November 2016. The output of refinery products, steel and cement rose by 8.2 per cent, 16.6 per cent and 17.3 per cent, respectively on an annual basis in November 2017, according to the data released by the commerce and industry ministry. Crude oil and natural gas output too registered a positive growth during the month under review. On the other hand, coal output growth rate recorded a negative growth during the month. Cumulatively, the growth in the eight core sectors during April-November this fiscal slowed to 3.9 per cent as against 5.3 per cent in the same period last fiscal. A healthy growth in key sectors will have positive implications on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) as these eight segments account for about 41 per cent of the total factory output. Commenting on the data, Economic Affairs Secretary S C Garg described 6.8 per cent rise in core sector output as an impressively growth.  \"Steel and cement growth at 16.6 per cent and 17.3 per cent indicates restoration of the production in these sectors over pre-demonetisation levels. It augurs well for real sector investment,\" he said in a tweet. ",

So far this fiscal, the country has recorded a CAD of 2.4 per cent in the first quarter and 1.2 per cent in Q2.\n\n\"Based on the anticipated widening of the merchandise trade deficit, we expect the current account gap to record a sizeable deterioration to USD 12-15 billion in Q3 or 2-2.3 per cent of GDP,\" its principal economist Aditi Nayar said.\n\nThe CAD,one of the most critical factors that dictates macro stability, had come at USD 7 billion in the September quarter and USD 8 billion in the December period last year.\n\nShe said shrinkage in the March quarter will happen despite unfavourable base effect of exports growth, and expectations of import commodity prices such as crude oil, coal, steel and non-ferrous metals, to remain elevated.\n\nExpectations of widening of merchandise trade deficit is largely due to the high prices of commodity imports, it said, adding the deficit is expected to be in the double- digits for the third straight month in December despite help from rising exports.\n\nThe merchandise trade deficit came at USD 14 billion each for October and November 2017.\n\nThe agency expects a push towards completion of export orders prior to the quarter-end as well as a seasonal decline in gold imports in December, both of which are likely to soften the merchandise trade deficit relative to the levels seen in the previous two months.\n\nCommenting on the short-term future, where it expects a sharp improvement, Icra said gold imports are likely to ease in Q4, relative to Q4 of FY17, which had witnessed a restocking-led spurt.\n\nAlso, an unfavourable base effect may arrest the pace of growth in merchandise exports in Q4 from an expected 15-16 per cent in Q3, it said, reiterating that seasonal factors will keep CAD under USD 5 billion for Q4.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Business leaders in India remained largely positive, but their level of optimism has dropped to its lowest level in four years even as it has hit a two-year high in the Asia-Pacific, says a report.\n\nAccording to the latest Grant Thornton's report, Asia Pacific business optimism has hit a 2-year high, largely driven by improvements from its two biggest economies, China and Japan, and region-wide positivity on prospects for increased trade.\n\nHowever, not all trajectories are heading upwards, the report titled 'Asia Pacific: trading and thriving' stated, adding that India's optimism mostly remained positive at 75 per cent, but \"has dropped to its lowest level in four years\".\n\nAustralia and New Zealand are on the same boat too, as optimism in Australia dropped to 58 per cent from 75 per cent a year ago and New Zealand's is down to 68 per cent, the lowest in two years.\n\n\"In the last 12 months, businesses in India have had to deal with the impact of radical reforms such as demonetisation, country-wide consolidated indirect tax and a new bankruptcy regime,\" said Vishesh C Chandiok, National Managing Partner, Grant Thornton India.\n\nChandiok, however, added that \"with the largest gain of any country in the 'World Bank ease of doing business ranking' and favourable macro-economic conditions, India remains one of the few bright spots in the global economy\".\n\nGrant Thornton's International Business Report (IBR) survey data showed that India's businesses are the most positive in the region (58 per cent) when it comes to the opportunity presented by increasing spending power of the rising middle class.\n\nThe biggest threat to the region cited by businesses is the trend of ageing populations, followed by regional conflict regarding competing territorial claims and the rebalancing of China's economy.\n\n\"Businesses across the region are grappling with a range of economic, cultural and political challenges, despite their overall positive outlook. If left unaddressed, these challenges could overshadow the growth prospects the report has identified,\" said Rodger Flynn, Grant Thornton regional head for Asia-Pacific.\n",

The Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) consultancy's 2018 World Economic League Table painted an upbeat view of the global economy, boosted by cheap energy and technology prices.\n\n\tIndia's ascent is part of a trend that will see Asian economies increasingly dominate the top 10 largest economies over the next 15 years.\n\n\t\"Despite temporary setbacks ... India's economy has still caught up with that of France and the UK and in 2018 will have overtaken them both to become the world's fifth largest economy in dollar terms,\" said Douglas McWilliams, Cebr deputy chairman.\n\n\tMcWilliams said India's growth had been slowed by restrictions on high-value banknotes and a new sales tax, a view shared by economists polled by Reuters.\n\n\tChina is likely to overtake the United States as the world's No.1 economy in 2032, Cebr said.\n\n\t\"Because the impact of President Trump on trade has been less severe than expected, the USA will retain its global crown a year longer than we anticipated in the last report,\" the report said.\n\n\tWhile Britain looks set to lag behind France over the next couple of years, Cebr predicted that Brexit's effects on Britain's economy will be less than feared, allowing it to overtake France again in 2020.\n\n\tRussia was vulnerable to low oil prices and too reliant on the energy sector, and looked likely to fall to 17th place among the world's largest economies by 2032, from 11th now.\n\n\tA Reuters poll of economists in late October suggested global economic growth in 2018 looks likely to quicken slightly to 3.6 percent from 3.5 percent this year - with risks to that forecast lying on the upside.\n\n\n\t(Editing by David Milliken)\n",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Indian Railways is expected to post total revenue of Rs 1.8 lakh crore in the current fiscal year, slightly short of initial target but 10% more than what it reported last year.\n A spike in coal loading and strong showing in the passenger category are driving the performance, Railway Board&rsquo;s member-traffic Mohd Jamshed told ET. In the year ended March 31, 2017, the railways posted revenue of Rs 1.64 lakh crore.\n\nThe target set in the government&rsquo;s budget for this year was Rs 1.88 lakh crore, which has now been revised to Rs 1.8 lakh crore.\n Slower economic growth has not dented the railways&rsquo; business to the extent expected. The economy grew 6% in first half of fiscal 2018, down sharply from 7.7% in the same period last year.\n\nIt expects Rs 1.12 lakh crore of the total revenue to come from freight loading and Rs 48,000 crore from passenger traffic. The remainingRs 20,000 crore would be from non-fare revenue cell, scrappage, monetising of railway land and compensation from the finance ministry for operating loss-making strategic rail lines in Kashmir and the north eastern states.\n\nIn the last financial year, it made Rs 1.04 lakh crore by loading nearly 111 crore tonnes of freight and almostRs 46,000 crore from passenger traffic. The remainingRs 14,000 crore came from non-fare segments.\n\nIn the current financial year, the railways is expecting to load 115.5 crore tonnes of cargo.\n\nThough this would be 1 crore tonnes short of its target of 116.5 crore tonnes, the railways is hopeful of an uptick in the last quarter as loading picks up generally in February and March.\n\n&ldquo;Last year we saw unprecedented growth in March. We could expect the same this year. However, a lot depends on foggy months of December and January,&rdquo; Jamshed said.\n\nIn the non-fare segment, the railways is expecting to generateRs 2,000 crore as licencing fee from the Rail Land Development Authority, the organisation responsible for monetising railway land.\n\nDynamic pricing in select trains and the launch of several new premium trains have helped boost revenue from the passenger segment, Jamshed said.\n\nThe railways is losing Rs 800 crore a year after service charges were waived on digital ticket booking, he said.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "MUMBAI: Estimating GDP growth in short- term is a very difficult task given \"shocks\" like GST, note- ban and bank NPAs, and the Indian economy may require two years to \"consolidate\" by which time we should aim for a 7.5 per cent growth, former RBI Governor YV Reddy has said.\n\n\"In a shock, negative element is front loaded. There will be some moderation, and there can be gain. The pain is there now, the gain will come. How much gain and in what gap is the (issue),\" Reddy told a select group of reporters here over the weekend.\n\n\"My guess is it might take a couple years to consolidate. In a couple of years, we should at least aim to go back to 7.5-8 per cent (growth),\" he added.\n\n\"The shock element is tapering off. The positive aspect is yet to come, it will come,\" he said.\n Reddy said the economy was helped by a positive shock for almost three years on account of the drop in oil prices, which, he underlined, were at a third of what they were doing during his governorship.\n However, the negative shocks like implementation of the indirect taxes reform Goods and Services Tax (GST), demonetisation and also the high quantum of non-performing assets in the banks hurt the growth rate, he said.\n\nReddy, whose conservative approach to regulation is lauded and described as one of the reasons which limited the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis, said the potential output growth has come down to 7 per cent now from the 8.5 per cent levels pre-crisis.\n\nThe decline is due to both international factors, where the global economic growth has declined and also domestic ones like the negative shocks, he said.\n\nReddy said opinion is divided on how to look at these negative shocks, which he said are looked at by foreigners as \"institutional changes\" in India.\n\n\"All these three, some people take it has permanently affected potential output, whereas some others say it is a (temporary) shock.\n\n\"So the question is how much is a shock? I think there is some element of a shock, some element of permanent improvement can also be there after a lag.\"\n\nSuch shocks, he said, makes the methodology of estimating growth \"undependable\" in the short-term, he said.\n\n\"When you wait short-term, you don't get all the data. You will say this is a proportion of that. In a way, the methodology for short-term forecasting is approximation.\n\n\"And when such a shock has occurred, then the methodology itself is undependable. And therefore, whatever number comes, don't even look at it.\"\n\nIt can be noted that the Reserve Bank is expecting growth on a gross value added basis to shoot up to 7.8 per cent by the fourth quarter in order to pull up the yearly growth to 6.7 per cent, which was maintained in the last policy review on December 6.\n\nSome analysts have said the central bank is too optimistic in its expectations, while some have backed it.\n\n\"All short-term projections can be subject to more differences of opinion. I am not following short-term forecastings at all, it is not worth it,\" Reddy said.\n\nIt can be noted that the growth rate slipped to a three-year low of 5.7 per cent for the April-June quarter and accelerated to 6.3 per cent in the succeeding one.\n\nPolicy-makers say this is below the potential of the country, whose 1.3 billion people result in a huge domestic market and also its exports penetration. They want to take it up to 8 per cent and beyond in the medium term.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: Why do people continue to flog a dead horse? Probably because some people aren&rsquo;t convinced it is dead. This comment is about persistent critiques of revision in India&rsquo;s national income accounts in January 2015. That changed the base, switched from GDP at factor cost to gross value added (GVA) at market prices, altered the source and brought national accounts more in conformity with international practice. This had been building up since 2008, with contributions from several respected national income estimation experts, and was no sudden sleight of hand in January 2015. This is par for the course and revisions should occur every five years, as better data and better sources of data become available.\n There will probably be another revision soon, with base shifting from 2011-12 to 2017-18. If nothing else, transition to GST warrants that. This doesn&rsquo;t mean there are no issues with data. When a substantial chunk of the economy is informal/unorganised, that is inevitable. While this remains a problem even for full-year numbers, it is more serious for quarterly figures. In addition, national income estimates are in current or nominal rupees. These are deflated (using GDP deflator as measure of inflation) to get constant figures (with 2011-12 as base). There are issues with the GDP deflator. It could be better and will no doubt be refined over time.\n\nThus, most economists will be more comfortable discussing (a) nominal growth; and (b) full-year numbers. But when Q2 of 2017-18 figures surface, there will be hype and debate about 6.3% real GDP growth in Q2, just as there was over 5.7% in Q1.\n\nLet&rsquo;s stick to real GDP growth, with growth of 5.7% in Q1 and 6.3% in Q2. But do note, after January 2015 changes, what&rsquo;s really estimated is GVA. GDP is derived from GVA by adding taxes and subtracting subsidies. Real GVA growth was 5.6% in Q1 and 6.1% in Q2. The difference between the two may look like decimal point differences, but there is a methodological issue.\n\nTackling Transition Since GST is under implementation, if you were India&rsquo;s chief statistician, do you think you would have an enviable task if you were asked to derive GDP from GVA? When there are better indirect tax figures, these Q2 numbers are certain to be revised. Sticking with GDP, what does the full year look like? There is no particular reason for Q3 to be remarkably superior to Q2, though Q4 should be better. Therefore, 6.5% for the entire year sounds about right. Shouldn&rsquo;t India be doing better? Indeed, and it shall, as reforms introduced by the government take hold.\n\nStarting with Q1 of 2018-19 (probably even Q4 of 2017-18), growth should cross 7% and inch towards 8%. There is plenty of slack within the system, though approach towards 9% requires exports to perform better. (Q2 export numbers aren&rsquo;t very good.) Do note that measures introduced by the government are broadly supply-side. These show results with a time-lag. Give it a couple of years.\n There was never any reason for the gloom and doom that 5.7% unleashed. No one has conclusively established any link between demonetisation and growth.\n There were transient effects, but those passed soon. GST is different. Few countries have implemented GST, as opposed to VAT, and even fewer have implemented something like a dual (Union and state) GST. GST implementation is a process and it takes time. Eventually, it leads to efficiency and growth and addition to tax revenue. But in the interim, it inevitably has transition problems.\n\nOther measures have also sought to incrementally shift more of the informal/unorganised to formal/organised. Though this too increases efficiency, it does lead to an immediate shock for the informal/unorganised. Part of the challenge for CSO (Central Statistical Organisation), or anyone for that matter, is to estimate impact on informal/unorganised, not only for quarterly estimates, but also the full year.\n\nBehind national income, there is something economists call a national income identity. National income is the sum of consumption, investment, government expenditure and net exports. If growth has to pick up, one of these four has to drive that. With the evidence of Q2, generalising a bit, consumption expenditure and government expenditure have driven growth. But understandably, because of fiscal constraints, there are limits to government expenditure.\n\nWhat about net exports (meaning both exports as a plus and imports as a minus) and private investments? Based on Q2 alone, neither has done that well. However, in some segments, there is still excess capacity, there are signs of private investment recovery, though there is a legacy of stressed assets in banks. Stated differently, to use an expression economists are prone to use, there are indeed structural problems and reforms are meant to address those. This is one way to look at the problem. Another way would be sectoral.\n\nBased on Q2 again, worries would be agriculture and construction. Both have a strong employment angle. Indeed, higher growth is necessary for employment generation. There too, India has a data problem.\n\nThe gloom and doom of 5.7% was unwarranted. That is the bottom line. If you happened to fall for it, Q2 gives you a more realistic picture. From now on, the news will only get better. Expect a bit of that in the last two quarters of 2017-18, but be patient, there will be more in 2018-19.\n\nThe writer is chairman, PM&rsquo;s Economic Advisory Council. Views are personal\n\n",

            "articleBody": "By Aurodeep\n The GDP figures released on Thursday for the July-September 2017 quarter is an important data point, primarily because it was meant to be a bellwether of whether India has finally escaped the gloom of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetisation-fuelled slowdown. To that extent, it hasn&rsquo;t disappointed.\n\nAt 6.3% year-on-year, it inches above the three-year low of 5.7% in the previous quarter. The previous quarter had seen GST-related inventory destocking writ large in sharply slowing industrial, particularly manufacturing, growth.\n\nInvestment growth grew by a whimpering 1.6%, while more worryingly, private consumption, that has been the sole dynamo of India&rsquo;s growth engine, registered yet another quarter of slowdown.\n\nServices on a High\nIn all of this doom and gloom, services growth remained surprisingly resilient at near 9% levels, driven by trade, hotel and financial services. The latest GDP statistic is reassuring in parts. Manufacturing growth has predictably &mdash; and fortunately &mdash; revived to 7% from 1.2%, indicating that some of the GST blues have ebbed, and the process of &lsquo;remonetisation&rsquo; is underway.\n\nInterestingly, it comes despite the high base of 7.7% in the previous year. Private investment growth has shown some verve, measuring 4.6% growth compared to 1.6% in the previous quarter.\n\nHowever, private consumption growth, which has been the key structure that has been supporting growth so far, is in a troubled place. In current price, its growth looks strong at 9.7%. However, in real terms &mdash; that is, at 2011-12 prices &mdash; there has been a fall to 6.6% from 7% in the last quarter.\n\nThis suggests that people&rsquo;s consumption growth is falling, while prices of these goods are rising.\n\nIt doesn&rsquo;t help that the government is too fiscally hamstrung to support growth with its own consumption, and has already spent most of what it had earmarked for spending. Government consumption growth has fallen from over 17% in the last quarter to around 4% presently.\n\nOn cue, the services sector, which has been one of the brighter spots, has disappointed. Comprising roughly 65% of GDP (including construction), it has slowed down to 6.6% from nearly 8% in the previous quarter.\n\nDoes all of this still mean we are out of the woods yet? Or, more relevantly, what woods are we talking about? Probably yes, if the conversation is about demonetisation and GST, although aftershocks of these policy earthquakes are likely to be felt across the year. And probably no, if we were to consider a slightly longer time frame.\n Average GDP growth over the past couple of years &mdash; FY 2015-2017 &mdash; has been over 7.5%, a jump from less than 6% growth averaged between 2013 and 2014. Whatever caused this sharp reversal in GDP trend since 2015? And what implications does it have for the economic outlook going forward? The question is particularly germane, given that the 7.5% average growth in the last three years, in fact, masks a spectacular fall in quarterly GDP figures since the last year-and-a-half, from 9% levels to around 6% presently.\n The answer is oil. End-2014 and much of 2015 saw a tumultuous crash of global crude oil prices. Oil affects the Indian economy in a number of ways. It affects the level of inflation, household incomes, bottomline of firms and government finances, both on the side of public revenues (taxes on fuel products), as well as public spending (through fuel and fertiliser subsidies).\n\nWelcome Rehab for Banks\nThe crash in oil prices led to a bonanza windfall, shared by all these actors. Strong private consumption, supported by the government&rsquo;s welcome increase in the quality of fiscal spending to favour public investment, led to an overall rise in GDP growth.\n\nMeanwhile, little of the rest improved.\n\nCompanies and banks continue to be laden with bad debt, restraining vital corporate performance indicators from performing well. Excess capacity continues to plague most sectors. To that extent, the massive recapitalisation package for public sector banks (PSBs) recently announced will ameliorate the unfortunate tragedy of balance sheets.\n\nMeanwhile, India has been struggling to capitalise on strong global growth by increasing its exports. Rather tellingly, export as a percentage of GDP has fallen to 19%, a level last seen back in 2005, when India was supposedly a far less mature exporting nation.\n\nOn the flip side, India&rsquo;s import growth remains stubbornly strong despite the economic slowdown, defeating the correlation that dictates that fall in growth discourages citizens from importing goods from the rest of the world. Prima facie, it may suggest an element of import substitution in the economy, wherein domestic supply chains are facing disruptions.\n\nWorryingly, all these factors still very much loom on the horizon. Add to this the fact that oil prices have already started escalating, and private consumption is slowing. With the rapid departure of a decade-long loose monetary policy globally that was keeping foreign investors addicted to emerging markets like ours, economists are already predicting current account deficit to more than double by next year.\n\nSo, yes, 6.3% is a definite uptick. But as Batman is warned by Catwoman in Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s The Dark Knight Rises, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a storm coming, Mr Wayne.&rsquo;\n\n",

            "articleBody": "\n\n\tNew Delhi: The oil ministry has set up a high-level committee to help frame fuel economy rules for tractors to moderate their diesel consumption that constitutes nearly 7.7 per cent of India's annual diesel use.\n The nine-member Steering Committee, headed by an additional secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, will submit an interim report in six months and a final one on the road map for development of the norms in 15 months, a ministry order said.\n\n\tTractors are used for different applications and the average fuel consumed for each application varies. On a rotavator, they may consume 7-8 litres per house while on a trailer, they may give an efficiency of 5-7 km per litre with the load. On static application like alternator or straw reaper, it could be 6-7 litres per house.\n\n\tDiesel is the most consumed fuel in India, accounting for over 56 per cent of 82 million tonnes of petroleum products used in April-October.\n\n\tAs much as 57 per cent of diesel is used by automobiles, with trucks guzzling 28.25 per cent. Tractors, agri equipment and agri pumpsets use 13 per cent diesel while cars and SUVs use 13.15 per cent of the fuel.\n \"In view of growing dependence of the country on import of crude oil and the fact that the consumption of diesel by tractors is about 7.7 per cent, it has been felt imperative by the government to define various norms for economic usage of fuel/diesel,\" the order stated.\n\n\tThe panel will \"develop road map for fuel efficiency norms of tractors in India\" and finalise phase-wise implementation.\n\n\tAlso, it will recommend category-wise norms for tractors and define a methodology for measurement of fuel efficiency.\n It will also examine norms and regulations being followed internationally and the effectiveness and possibility of replication to suit Indian conditions.\n\n\tIt will \"consider and recommend to the appropriate government to take forward required legislation or Act or notification or suggest an amendment to an existing legislation, Act or notification for enforcement of norms and its promotion in India, if necessary\". The panel will consist of a joint secretary-level representative from the Department of Heavy Industries, the director general of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, the Director of Pune-based Automotive Research Association of India and the president of the Tractor Manufacturers Association. \n",

            "articleBody": "By Archana Chaudhary and Vrishti Beniwal\n\nIndia&rsquo;s exporters are a worried lot.\n\nFour months after India&rsquo;s biggest tax overhaul, traders are still waiting for 500 billion rupees ($7.7 billion) they say the government owes them in refunds, leaving them short of operating capital as overseas sales suffer.\n &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an alarming situation,&rdquo; said A. Sakthivel, regional chairman of the Federation of Indian Exporters Organisation in southern India. \"Our working capital is stuck, we&rsquo;re losing revenues and now we&rsquo;re having to let workers go.\" More than 10,000 workers have lost their jobs in the Tirupur export hub that employs half a million in the state of Tamil Nadu, according to Sakthivel.\n India&rsquo;s exports dipped for the first time in 15 months this October, falling 1.1 percent to $23.1 billion, even as the government tinkered with ways to simplify the hurriedly implemented nationwide goods and services tax. While last month&rsquo;s trade deficit widened the most in three years to $14 billion, exports are expected to fall further in November if prices of crude oil, India&rsquo;s biggest import, continue to climb, traders say.\n The decline in exports combined with the slowing of India&rsquo;s $2.3 trillion economy contrasts with the accelerating global economy. With elections due in key states over the next few months, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s home state of Gujarat -- India&rsquo;s second-most industrialized state with annual exports worth $60 billion -- his government faces the twin challenges of restoring business and saving informal sector jobs.\n\n\n\nNitin D. Wakankar, a spokesman in the commerce ministry, didn&rsquo;t respond to calls seeking comment.\n\nSmall, unorganized businesses -- especially in traditionally dominant textiles and jewelry sectors -- have witnessed the worst supply chain disruptions since July, exporters say. Two-thirds of India&rsquo;s exports basket comprises traditional product groups, including gems and jewelry, pharmaceuticals, textiles, engineering goods, food and fuel. In spite of extended deadlines for tax filing and large-scale reviews that eased rates for merchant exporters, the flow of cash refunds remains slow, according to traders.\n\nAlthough exports are likely to stabilize after the GST-driven distortions subside, the traditional product mix will hinder the country&rsquo;s ability to participate in the ongoing trade upturn, according to Radhika Rao, Singapore-based economist at DBS Bank.\n\n\"Idiosyncratic drags from GST-related uncertainty and the effect of duty drawback\" have added to trade headwinds, Rao wrote in a report on Nov. 22.\n\nThe government&rsquo;s efforts to address exporters&rsquo; concerns will begin to show results shortly, according to Ajay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations. But in the meantime, many of the smaller exporters had to stop accepting fresh orders for lack of funds after paying taxes, he said.\n The liquidity crunch has worsened with banks unwilling to lend exporters for GST payouts while they wait for refunds. Having to borrow more was further hurting profitability, said Ganesh Kumar Gupta, Mumbai-based chairman of Akaash Textiles Pvt. Ltd. and Vijay Silk House Group.\n\n\"GST will help the whole nation but the system is just not working,&rdquo; Gupta said. \"We&rsquo;d rather the government kept exporters out of the GST completely.\"\n\n",

            "articleBody": "\n New Delhi: Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu today exuded confidence that exports will gather momentum going forward as the economy is on course to double to USD 5 trillion and become the third largest in the world, over the next few years.\n\n\t\"Our economy shall grow from USD 2.5 trillion now to USD 5 trillion and it will become the third largest over the next few years. With such an economic growth, our international trade will also grow,\" Prabhu told World Trade Expo 2017 here in a video message.\n Earlier this week, the American brokerage a Bank of America Merrill Lynch had said projected that India would overtake Japan to become the third largest economy in the world by 2028 as it expects the nominal GDP to clip at 10 per cent over the next one decade.\n The report noted that at USD 2.26 billion the country has already overtaken Brazil and Russia to emerge as the second largest BRIC economy after China and is well on track to cross France and Britain to emerge as the world's fifth largest after Germany by 2019.\n\n\tLast year the economy closed at USD 2.26 trillion. But the report did not quantify the size of the economy by 2028 when it would be the third largest after China and the US. At around USD 5 trillion, Japan is the third largest economy now.\n\n\t\"This expo is being held at a time when the economy is growing faster than before. I am sure this expo will help foreign countries understand India and its economy better in promoting trade,\" Prabhu said.\n\n\tHis statement comes two days after his ministry said exports dipped 1.12 per cent to USD 23bn in October and trade deficit ballooned, retreating from a six-month high growth in September as shipments of textiles, pharma, leather and gems and jewellery fell.\n\n\tImports, however, grew by 7.6 per cent to USD 37.11 billion in October from USD 34.5 billion in the year-ago month. Trade deficit widened to USD 14 billion from USD 11.13 billion in October 2016.\n\n\tCumulative exports during April-October rose an anemic 9.62 per cent to USD 170.28 billion, while imports grew almost three times faster at 22.21 per cent to USD 256.43 billion, leaving a trade deficit of USD 86.14 billion.\n Addressing the event, MSME secretary Arun Kumar Panda expressed hope that trade expos like this will act as a unique platform to integrate the khadi and village industries, micro, and MSMEs in the global value chain.\n\n\tNoting that around 60 million MSMEs contribute 90 per cent to industrial production, he said \"it is time MSMEs look beyond the borders and showcase their skills and excellence to the global market.\n\n\tThe foreign trade policy aims to increase share of exports in world to 3.5 per cent from under 2 per cent, according to the commerce ministry.\n\n\t\"The commerce ministry has also highlighted the need to shift the focus to emerging sectors and promote the bottom 10 items in the list of exports,\" additional director general of foreign trade Sonia Sethi said.\nRepresentatives from over 37 countries are participating in the expo. These countries account for 17 per cent of the country's total trade.\n\n",

The global economy is also moving up,\" said Jaitly.\n\n\tAs part of the summit, Jaitley met the senior management of Morgan Stanley and addressed a gathering of senior fund managers and key financial institutional investors.\n\n\t\"How do I see the economy moving? our basic parametres are quite stable. And we grew between 7-8 per cent over the last three years, he said.\n \"Therefore, we need over the next, at least, a decade, if not more, significantly higher growth rates in order to go ahead with expansion plan of the Indian economy, Jaitley said.\n\n\tThe finance minister also assured investors of a strong banking sector in India.\n\n\t\"The combination of the IT scheme and now the large-scale recapitalisation we have announced should be put into motion expeditiously,\" he said.\n\n\tThe combination of these two steps are likely to improve the capacity of the banks, and even lend their surplus, particularly to the small and medium-scale industries which need those funds in abundance because they are the ones that are the big job creators and keep the Indian economy going, he elaborated.\n\n\tHe also clarified the often over-stated labour issues, saying these were no longer there as the negative environment of disruption of industrial activity is long over.\n\n\tHe said the labour laws are being fortified by taking the unions into consultation, and there has not been any significant labour resistance in recent times, whether it is disinvestment or privatisation, he said.\n\n\t\"We haven t encountered trade union resistance as that is concerned,\" he pointed out, adding that there are already various kinds of reforms.\n Responding to questions from investors, he said among the privatisation of public sector units (PSUs), Air India is in a very advanced stage while some of the PSUs will be kept as they are.\n\n\tThe state enterprises in the oil and some in the power sectors will be kept as PSUs.\n \"But there are many which will be privatised, he added, pointing to a list prepared by the NITI Aayog.\n\n\t\"In any case, we are going with the divestment programme very actively, said the minister.\n\n\tHe also gave the investors an update on the ongoing business reforms, and called for investments for changing the landscape of India with an accelerated pace.\nJaitley, who is on a two-day visit to Singapore, held meetings with Singapore ministers and investors.\n\n",

These units have around 20 per cent localisation,\" consul general of Russian Federation in Mumbai Andrei Zhiltsov told here over the weekend.\n He said Moscow recently signed an agreement with New Delhi for the units 5 &amp; 6, which will begin after the ongoing units 3 &amp; 4 are completed.\n\n\t\"Currently, the extent of localisation in the commissioned units is near 20 per cent but going forward we expect it to increase over 50 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\tAt present, the Russians are sourcing locally manufactured parts and equipment to the tune of around 20 per cent. \"But by the time we reach units 5 &amp; 6, we hope local sourcing will increase to nearly 50 per cent,\" Zhiltsov added.\n\n\tThe fifth and sixth units will cost about Rs 50,000 crore with half of it being funded by Russia as loan. The third and fourth units began last year and will cost Rs 39,747 crore.\n Russia has also offered India the latest \"generation 3-plus\" nuclear reactors -- the VVER-1200-powered by advanced fuel -- for the yet-to-be designated site in parallel to the ongoing 6,000-mw Kudankulam project.\n\n\t\"We expect a new site for the six reactors to be announced soon. If we do this project, it will allow us to lower the construction cost since we already have the expertise and equipment and so will not have to start afresh. Also, serial production is cheaper,\" Zhiltsov said. He said for a fast-growing economy like India there will be no substitute for nuclear power and Russia will participate in the Indian growth story. PSK BEN RSY PTP \n",

            "articleBody": "By Javier Blas\n The financiers and corporate chieftains gathered for Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s &lsquo;Davos in the Desert&rsquo; heard the same message again and again. From the crown prince down, Saudi leaders wanted no room for doubt: the initial public offering of oil giant Aramco is \"on track\" for 2018.\n\nBut beneath the disciplined message put forward in Riyadh lies a more uncertain reality. The 2018 deadline looks tight and the final shape of the deal -- exactly where it happens, how big it is and who gets to take part -- is no clearer than it was a week ago.\n There&rsquo;s a lot at stake in Saudi Arabia and beyond. Potentially the biggest equity sale in history, the IPO is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&rsquo;s ambitious reform program and intended to seed a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund to carry the Middle East&rsquo;s biggest economy through the end of the oil age. It will also mean a giant pay day for Aramco&rsquo;s Wall Street advisers including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley.\n\nSince Prince Mohammed surprised everyone in early 2016 with his promise to partially privatize the country&rsquo;s most valuable asset, Saudi officials have said the IPO would take place next year and involve both a domestic and an international listing, most likely in London or New York.\n\nAs recently as this month, Khalid Al Falih, the country&rsquo;s energy minister and a close confidant of the prince, supported the official line: the IPO will happen in 2018, both on the Tadawul, Riyadh&rsquo;s local exchange, and overseas.\n\nYet on Thursday, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, the country&rsquo;s finance minister, became the first senior official to openly discuss the possibility of forgoing the international part of the IPO -- its most important element.\n \"We have said publicly that Tadawul is for certain,&rdquo; Al-Jadaan told the Financial Times. \"Are we going to go with an international market? If we go, where are we going? And if we go, are we going public or we are going private?\"\n\nWhat&rsquo;s more, Aramco executives have started to make a distinction between their preparatory work, which they said will be completed on time for 2018, and the decision to go ahead with the IPO, which is in the hands of the royal court.\n\n&ldquo;Things are on track for 2018,&rdquo; Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser told Bloomberg at the conference. But when asked specifically if that included both the domestic and international IPO, he hedged his response. &ldquo;That decision will be decided by the shareholder, not by the company. The shareholder will make the decision regarding the venues.\"\n\nThe head of the local exchange also opened the door to a Saudi-only listing. Khalid Al Hussan said the Tadawul had the \"aspiration\" to handle the listing alone. He also warned that even if the listing only takes place in Riyadh, the timetable for a sale in 2018 \"will be very tight.\"\n\nIn a country were businessmen seldom speak publicly on government affairs, his comments were seen by many as another indication that Saudi Arabia is reconsidering its initial plan to list Aramco internationally.\n\n\"Going through the IPO process is complicated,\" Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah said in an interview in Riyadh. \"It&rsquo;s a big move even for a small company, so you can imagine when a very big company, which is so significant for the wealth of the country, is going through that process, it&rsquo;s normal that some compromises take time to be defined.&rdquo;\n\nAnd yet, the IPO is so important for Prince Mohammed, who&rsquo;s become the kingdom&rsquo;s dominant political force, that few would dare to bet against it.\n\nPrince Mohammed, often known by the acronym MBS, has said Aramco could be worth at least at $2 trillion, giving the 5 percent the country has said it could sell at a market valuation of $100 billion, dwarfing the $25 billion that Chinese group Alibaba raised in the biggest IPO to date. And with the crown prince firmly behind it, many believe that Aramco will be sold in 2018, whatever it takes.\n\nPrivately, Aramco executives and its advisers say that if the government gives the green light soon, a listing on the second half of 2018 in Riyadh is possible, but adding London or New York on top would be very difficult. A domestic sale could be enough to claim mission accomplished and save face, even if it&rsquo;s a long way from the original plan.\n \"Clearly, there are many serious problems with Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s privatization,\" said Paul Stevens, an oil expert at Chatham House think tank in London. \"The problem: it is the flagship for Vision 2030 and MBS&rsquo;s reputation.\" \n",

            "articleBody": "By: Vrishti Beniwal and Bibhudatta Pradhan\n For the first time in his three-and-a-half year rule, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing sustained discontent over his economic policies as growth slows, job losses mount and distressed farmers protest.\n Four senior members of Modi&rsquo;s Bharatiya Janata Party have hit out at the government, emboldening the country&rsquo;s weak opposition and challenging the previously unstoppable leader to find quick fixes before the 2019 national polls and a raft of state votes. And as criticism of the Modi&rsquo;s economic management intensifies, the usually loud voices of his supporters are falling silent.\n India lost its \"fastest-growing major economy\" tag as growth slipped below 6 percent in the latest quarter. The moderation was partly the result of Modi&rsquo;s boldest moves -- demonetization, as well as the chaotic introduction of the goods and services tax that continues to disrupt supply chains. As talk of a stimulus to boost growth sparked concerns of fiscal slippage, foreign investors went on selling spree and rupee started falling.\n \"The act of dissenters has the potential of snowballing out of control,\" said Sandeep Shastri, a political analyst and pro-vice chancellor at Jain University in Bengaluru. The response of the prime minister and party president Amit Shah \"is indicative of the serious attempt at damage control.\"\n\nWar of Words The criticism of Modi&rsquo;s handling of the economy is mounting, with Yashwant Sinha, former finance minister under Atal Bihari Vajpayee&rsquo;s BJP-led-government, writing a strongly-worded piece saying the economy was in a \"mess\". In an interview to Bloomberg Sinha said he was the voice of many in the party who wouldn&rsquo;t speak out of fear.\n BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha backed him. Sinha \"has shown the mirror on the economic condition of India\", he tweeted, calling it a \"matter of grave national importance.\" Arun Shourie, also a minister under Vajpayee, equated Modi&rsquo;s move to ban 86 percent of the currency in circulation to tackle unaccounted wealth with &lsquo;suicide&rsquo;. Subramanian Swamy, a former Harvard lecturer and BJP lawmaker, warned the economy was heading for a &ldquo;major depression&rdquo;. Congress leader Anand Sharma called it \"monumental mismanagement\" of the economy.\n\n\n\nModi hit back. A \"handful of people\" were trying to \"spread pessimism\" based on the growth numbers for a quarter, Modi said on Oct. 4, in a rare moment on the defensive. He added his government was fully committed to reverse the trend of slowing growth and \"ready to take decisions.\" And his ministers -- including Yashwant Sinha&rsquo;s son, Jayant Sinha -- have fallen in behind their leader.\n\n\"If he is able to resolve the immediate economic challenges, then the impact will be minimal,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Ajoy Bose, a Delhi-based author and political analyst. \"The government and the BJP are aware that public is slowly getting annoyed with them -- there is a general perception that instead of getting better, things are getting worse.\"\n\nJagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office, didn&rsquo;t respond to calls seeking comment.\n\nExpert Advice\nApart from political adversaries and party members who may have an axe to grind with him, Modi&rsquo;s ardent supporters are also showing disappointment. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of BJP, has expressed concerns on the impact of government policy on small traders.\n Modi constituted a five-member panel on Sept. 25 to advise him on economic issues, signalling an awareness of growing concerns about the prospects of the Indian economy. His finance minister, Arun Jaitley, followed it up by reducing sales tax on about two dozen items last weak to ease the GST burden and douse public resentment over a rise in prices.\n\nAnd while Modi is partly responsible for the dip in growth, he can&rsquo;t do much to revive it, said D. H. Pai Panandiker, president of New Delhi-based think tank, RPG Foundation. \"Some problems will drag on -- unemployment is not going to resolve soon and we need correction of exchange rate and reduction in interest rates. The ball is in central bank&rsquo;s court now.\"\n\nStruggling Opposition Demonetization and growth slippage didn&rsquo;t affect Modi&rsquo;s prospects in state polls earlier this year. He got a thumping victory in India&rsquo;s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. Yashwant Sinha called it \" good marketing\" and said Modi would have to rely on it again as there was hardly any time to fix India&rsquo;s problems before the 2019 polls.\n\n\"The extent to which the Modi government embraces expensive welfare programs in the 2017-2018 budget early next year will be one indicator of how worried the party is about its electoral chances,\" Sasha Riser-Kositsky, an Asia analyst with the Washington-based Eurasia Group said via email. \"While there is still time for a serious challenger to emerge, the opposition is bereft of both leadership and a compelling platform that it can present as a credible alternative.\"\n\n\n\nModi may not have the same edge in national polls. He is yet to deliver on his promise of creating enough jobs for the youth in 1.3 billion-strong country. Distressed farmers have hit the streets amid slowing agriculture growth and dwindling incomes.\n\n\"At the moment, Modi is the tallest leader and there does not seem to be any clear cut alternative,\" Bose said. \"But at the same time, if there is public anger, then the larger you are, the harder you fall.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "\n Washington: In a breakthrough, scientists have developed a new nanomaterial that uses solar energy to generate hydrogen from seawater, producing the low cost and clean-burning fuel more efficiently than existing materials.\n The advance may lead to a new source of hydrogen fuel, ease demand for fossil fuels and boost the economy of countries where sunshine and seawater are abundant.\n\n\tIt is possible to produce hydrogen to power fuel cells by extracting the gas from seawater, but the electricity required to do it makes the process costly.\n\n\tResearchers from University of Central Florida in the US developed a new catalyst that is able to not only harvest a much broader spectrum of light than other materials, but also stand up to the harsh conditions found in seawater.\n \"We've opened a new window to splitting real water, not just purified water in a lab. This really works well in seawater,\" said Yang Yang, assistant professor at UCF.\n\n\tYang developed a method of fabricating a photocatalyst composed of a hybrid material. Tiny nanocavities were chemically etched onto the surface of an ultrathin film of titanium dioxide, the most common photocatalyst.\n\n\tThose nanocavity indentations were coated with nanoflakes of molybdenum disulfide, a two-dimensional material with the thickness of a single atom.\n\n\tTypical catalysts are able to convert only a limited bandwidth of light to energy. With its new material, Yang's team is able to significantly boost the bandwidth of light that can be harvested.\n\n\tBy controlling the density of sulphur vacancy within the nanoflakes, they can produce energy from ultraviolet-visible to near-infrared light wavelengths, making it at least twice as efficient as current photocatalysts.\n\n\t\"We can absorb much more solar energy from the light than the conventional material,\" Yang said.\n\n\tIn many situations, producing a chemical fuel from solar energy is a better solution than producing electricity from solar panels, he said.\n\n\tThat electricity must be used or stored in batteries, which degrade, while hydrogen gas is easily stored and transported.\nFabricating the catalyst is relatively easy and inexpensive. Researchers are now trying to find the best way to scale up the fabrication, and further improve its performance so that it is possible to split hydrogen from wastewater.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "DHAKA: After the Centre taking a hit of Rs 26,000 crore by cutting excise duty on oil, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today nudged states to cut sales tax or VAT on petrol and diesel to provide further relief to consumers from high fuel prices.\n Jaitley, who is here on three-day official visit, said the Rs 2 per litre cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel was done to give relief from relentless increase in prices and leave more money in hands of consumers.\n\n\"Now it is up to state governments if they are concerned with the issue (to cut sales tax or VAT),\" he told reporters here.\n\nReferring to opposition ruled states, he said some state governments, particularly in Kerala and Delhi, were at the forefront of demanding a cut in duties.\n\n\"And therefore state governments must really look at their own VAT collections,\" he said.\n\nJaitley said a large part of taxes collected on petroleum products goes to states. Besides their own VAT collection, they also get 42 per cent of central duties.\n And so states must also bear a part of the impact, he said, adding that the revenues of both the Centre and state governments would be impacted by duty cuts but an upward movement in the economy would give adequate space for covering up of the lost revenue.\n\n\"When global oil prices are high, there is some kind of cushion required to be provided as far as consumers are concerned. Therefore, we have taken a conscious decision to that effect,\" he said.\n\nAsked if BJP-ruled states would also be nudged to cut VAT, he said, \"I think the states manage their finances and I am sure states are also close to their own people.\"\n\nStates that levy VAT as high as 40 per cent will \"adequately factor this concern in,\" he said.\n BJP-ruled Maharashtra levies 46.52 per cent VAT (47.64 per cent in Mumbai) on petrol, the highest in the country. Andhra Pradesh has 38.82 per cent VAT on petrol while BJP- governed Madhya Pradesh levies 38.79 per cent VAT on the fuel.\n\nBJP-led NDA governs 18 out of the 29 states.\n\nDelhi and Himachal Pradesh levy 27 per cent VAT on petrol while Punjab has 36.04 per cent VAT. Haryana levies 26.25 per cent VAT.\n\nJaitley said a lot of oil revenue to centre and states is eventually used for infrastructure and social sector.\n In New Delhi, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said states should cut sales tax or VAT on petrol and diesel by 5 per cent.\n\nJaitley, he said, will soon write to all states on the issue.\n\n\"We have proactively cut excise duty. Now it is the turn of states to reduce VAT,\" Pradhan told reporters.\n\nUnlike the Centre, states levy VAT as an ad valorem duty which rises every time there is an increase in price.\n\nThe Centre, he said, sacrificed Rs 26,000 crore in revenue in the cut in excise duty.\n\n\"States are the biggest beneficiary. They get all of the VAT collection plus they also get 42 per cent of the central excise collections. The amount remaining with the Centre is used to finance centrally sponsored schemes in states,\" he said.\n\nThe Centre had raised excise duty by Rs 11.77 per litre on petrol and Rs 13.47 a litre on diesel between November 2014 and January 2016 to take away gains arising from plummeting international oil rates.\n\nYesterday, it reduced excise duty on petrol to Rs 19.48 per litre from Rs 21.48 per litre and on diesel to Rs 15.33 a litre from Rs 17.33 previously.\n\nThis after petrol price rose by Rs 7.8 since early July to reach over three-year high of Rs 70.88 a litre in Delhi while diesel rates had risen by Rs 5.7 to touch an all-time high of Rs 59.14.\n\nPradhan said as a result of the excise duty reduction, petrol price has been cut by Rs 2.5 per litre and diesel by Rs 2.25.\n\nPetrol in Delhi now costs Rs 68.38 a litre and diesel is now priced at Rs 56.89.\n\n",

Similarly, it was aiming to provide 24X7 power to all by March, 2019.\n \"Prime Minister has said December 2018 is the target. We will do it. This is a tight target but we will do. Every household will get electricity by December 2018,\" Singh said at the launch of 'Saubhagya' scheme for providing power to all households.\n\n\"One more important target we have got, that is 24X7 power, reliable and quality power. We will take a proposal to the Prime Minister,\" he said.\n\nSingh also talked about the pre-paid model to be adopted for electricity to all households as per government plans.\n\nHe stressed on the need for developing skills for the power sector and said that \"there is need for skill development for grid and feeder maintenance\".\n He called upon the industry to invest in the power sector saying that in the coming year, the demand for electricity is going to increase in view of high growth economy.\n\n\"I appeal to the industry to come and invest. India's energy requirement is going to quadruple. You please come and invest,\" he added.\n\nThe government has been working hard to electrify all the villages in the country and also want to achieve 24X7 Power for All by March, 2019.\n In the 2015 Independence day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the government will electrify the remaining 18,452 unelectrified villages in 1,000 day. However, the power ministry is expected electrify all the inhabited villages by December this year.\n\nAccording to GARV portal, out of the 18,452 villages, 14,483 villages have been electrified so far. The electrification work is in progress for 2,981 villages while 988 villages are uninhabited.\n\nThe portal also indicates that out of the 17.92 core households in the rural areas, 13.87 crore families have got electricity connection. As many as 4.05 crore families are yet to provided electricity connection.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The government may soon unveil a package of measures to speed up growth, generate employment, lift exports and step up investment in infrastructure.\n A broad framework to boost the economy was discussed in a meeting of ministers and officials chaired by finance minister Arun Jaitley late Tuesday evening as the government grappled with a slump in growth.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi will take a final decision on the measures, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations. &ldquo;We may need to take some specific, targeted steps... It's not as if there is a course correction,&rdquo; a government official said.\n There has been concern in government circles over growth slumping to a three-year low of 5.7% in the April-June quarter with disruption due to the rollout of goods and services tax (GST) and lingering impact of demonetisation being the primary cause. A rise in the current account deficit and inflation has added to worries. Some economists have argued that the decline is structural in nature and needs to be addressed appropriately.\n\nFinance minister Jaitley is expected to consult other ministries before preparing a detailed plan that will be presented to the prime minister. The plan is expected to examine the reasons for the slowdown and the measures that can be taken to accelerate growth. A stocktaking meeting by the prime minister could not take place on Tuesday.\n\nChief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian had briefed the prime minister on the economic situation last week.\n The meeting was attended by commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu, Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar, secretaries of key economic ministries and the additional secretary to the PM.\n\nThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) called for a 100 basis point reduction in interest rates to &ldquo;inject huge growth impulse&rdquo; and urged the Centre and states to ensure that public capital investment remains elevated even as it pointed to a rebound in many sectors. A basis point is 0.01percentage point. The Reserve Bank of India is set to make its next monetary policy statement on October 4.\n\nFISCAL ESCAPE CLAUSE\nState Bank of India&rsquo;s Ecowrap said the economy has been in slowdown mode since the second quarter of FY17 and such prolonged slump cannot be called technical or transient.\n\nQuarterly growth has declined from 7.9% in first quarter of FY17 to 5.7% in first quarter of FY18. SBI group chief economic advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh said there is urgent need of a fiscal push to shore up growth. That may not be easy since the government has pledged to reduce fiscal deficit to 3.2% of GDP this year and 3% next year.\n\nEXPORTS AND JOBS WORRY\nIndia&rsquo;s exports have not picked up to the extent expected even as the global economy has rebounded. Export growth was 8.57% in the April-August period while imports rose 26.63%, worsening the trade deficit and the current account deficit.\n\nThe appreciation of the rupee has eroded India&rsquo;s exports competitiveness while teething troubles with GST have not helped. Exporters met revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia to present demands for relief. The sluggish growth has also led to worries about job creation.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The Centre is exploring ways to make it mandatory for all government departments and agencies &mdash; including services such as railways and road transport corporations &mdash; to accept digital payments at points of consumer interface, according to senior government officials.\n\nAlso on the drawing board are plans for greater integration of the online payment gateways of these state-owned agencies with official payment modes such as BHIM and Bharat QR code, the officials cited above told ET. The government is also considering incentives for citizens opting for digital payments.\n According to a senior official, the government may launch a big-ticket campaign on Gandhi Jayanti to announce some of these measures to achieve its goal of a cashless economy. The campaign will run till Republic Day (January 26).\n\n&ldquo;Government payments account for a huge percentage of overall transactions, and if these can be done digitally, electronic payments will see massive growth,&rdquo; said the official.\n\nLast week, at an internal review meeting of the ministry of electronics and IT, which has been given the mandate of promoting digital payments, union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asked officials to roll out the campaign from October 2.\n\nThe details of the proposals are being discussed by the inter-ministerial committee on digital payments.\n\n&ldquo;We have decided to equip all our ticket counters to accept digital payments. Under the new guidelines, Bharat QR code will be put up at all 14 lakh reservation counters across the country. We are targetting to make half the transactions at ticket counters digitally enabled,&rdquo; a top Railway Board official told ET.\n\n&ldquo;The same will be done for freight bookings too. Already, 90% of payments for freight are cashfree,&rdquo; he added.\n\n\n Indian Railways sells passenger tickets worth Rs 52,000 crore every year and 60% of these are through the online booking portal. The rest are sold at reservation counters, mostly in cash.\n &ldquo;One of the ideas is how to make Bharat QR code a universally accepted payment infrastructure,&rdquo; said another official. The person added, however, that a lot of background work may be required as Bharat QR code still doesn&rsquo;t accept payments from people without a debit or credit card.\n\n&ldquo;Digital is still not the primary mode of payment. Lots of ideas are being discussed on how to reduce dependence on cash, but they are still to be finalised,&rdquo; said the official.\n\nOne of the proposals being discussed includes integration of BHIM and UPI with all online payment options of government departments and public sector undertakings (PSUs).\n\nAll points of government-public interface, such as bus, train and metro ticket counters and passport offices, may be asked to accept payments through Bharat QR code. All utility bills, such as electricity and water, may have to print Bharat QR code as a prominent payment option.\n\nAnother proposal includes incentivising state road transport corporations to shift to digital payments and push them to offer discounts, along with a missive to all ministries and PSUs to promote digital payments.\n\nAccording to a senior roads ministry official, the government is planning to make RFID toll tags mandatory for all cars from October.\n &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll also equip all toll lanes to accept digital payments. The focus is to have electronic toll collection, but we&rsquo;ll also be displaying Bharat QR code for people who want to pay through BHIM app,&rdquo; said the official.\n Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which currently sees a majority of its card recharges and token sales through cash, is also focusing on digital payments.\n\n&ldquo;We have enabled all recharges to be made online or through cards. Consumers can even do it through banking apps. Cash handling is difficult, so it&rsquo;s better to be as cash-free as possible,&rdquo; the DMRC spokesperson said.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: A troop standoff along the border with China isn&rsquo;t the only worry for Indian policy makers.\n The weaker yuan is intensifying a flood of cheap Chinese goods into the country, threatening to hurt India&rsquo;s struggling factories and blow out its biggest bilateral trade deficit. So authorities should take steps to support domestic companies as well as curb gains in the rupee, said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, the nation&rsquo;s biggest lender and one of its top currency traders.\n India must \"reduce dependence on such frivolous Chinese imports,\" Ghosh said. Failing to do so would erode competitiveness at Indian companies and put at risk Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s flagship &lsquo;Make in India&rsquo; campaign, he said.\n The comments follow years of US threats to brand China a currency manipulator and come as Indian and Chinese soldiers face off in a remote area of the Himalayas. The risks to India&rsquo;s economy are more pronounced as a new national sales tax disrupts supply chains. Factory output contracted in June for the first time in four years, official data show, mirroring subdued private surveys. That stands to only burnish the appeal of inexpensive Chinese imports.\n India mainly ships electronic products, engineering goods and chemicals from China, its biggest trading partner, with whom its trade deficit has ballooned nine-fold over the past decade to $49 billion in 2016. This figure was about $51 billion for the fiscal year through March 31, on imports of $61.3 billion.\n India&rsquo;s central bank does not comment on day-to-day currency fluctuations and doesn&rsquo;t target a particular exchange rate for the rupee. But it has been intervening in the currency market to curtail the rupee&rsquo;s gains, traders say.\n\nThe rupee has strengthened 6 per cent versus the US dollar this year, while the yuan has gained 4 per cent. China&rsquo;s currency has weakened some 2 per cent against the rupee, extending last year&rsquo;s 4 per cent decline, the steepest fall among 10 major Asian currencies.\n\nThese rupee gains could trigger expectations of further appreciation, lulling importers into leaving their currency exposures unhedged, Ghosh warned. At least 40 per cent of current portfolios aren&rsquo;t protected against exchange-rate swings, according to State Bank of India projections.\n\n&ldquo;If this trend of rupee appreciation continues, thereby making goods from China cheaper, our imports from China could very well exceed the level of $61.3 billion attained in financial year to March 2017,\" Ghosh said.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "MUMBAI: India Inc reported a revival in year-on-year sales growth in the June quarter albeit amid pressure on profits and profitability. The trend is expected to continue since the next two quarters will reflect gradual stability in business after the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) on July 1 and expected higher demand due to the festival season and a good monsoon.\n\nHowever, firm input costs including those of raw materials and staff as a percentage of sales, along with a rising interest burden relative to operating profit may affect profitability.\n\nA sample of 1,024 companies excluding those in the banking, finance, and oil and gas sectors reported the highest sales growth in five quarters of 5.6% year-on-year. However, operating profit growth slowed to 3.5% after staying above 6% in the previous five quarters. Growth in net profit at 10.6% was the slowest in four quarters. After including oil and gas sector companies, the sample size increased to 1,043 and sales growth improved to 9.7% while net profit growth was just 1.7% in the June quarter.\n\n While top line growth shows a gradual recovery, input costs seem to be inching up. This is unlike a few quarters ago when companies were able to implement cost efficiencies, thereby protecting margins while sales growth was under pressure.\n\nFor the sample excluding oil and gas companies, raw material costs as a percentage of sales inched up to 31% in the June quarter from 30.6% in the year-ago period. After falling to 30% in the December 2015 quarter, the ratio has remained at around 31%.\n\nThe staff cost relative to sales was 14.7% in the June quarter compared with 14.9% a year ago. It has increased significantly from 11.8% three years ago.\n\nGood Monsoon may Spur Spending\nAnother cost component that has recorded an increase over the years is interest relative to operating profit (EBIT). The ratio was at 26.5%, the highest since the June 2014 quarter, when it was 22.1%.\n On the sector front, companies from the automobile, capital gods, cement, construction, consumer goods and textile sectors reported growth in net profit at the aggregate level. On the other hand, pharma, power, realty, retail, steel, telecom sectors reported a decline in profit.\n\nThe satisfactory monsoon in several parts of the country and higher sowing activity should support rural spending in the quarters to come.\n The festive season in the September and the December quarter will add more momentum to consumption demand. Industrial demand may, however, remain tepid considering there aren&rsquo;t any major signs of capital expenditure and efforts by debt-laden companies to seek financial restructuring. \n",

Except for Sun Pharma&rsquo;s Dilip Shanghvi, all the billionaires have minted money.\n Mukesh Ambani, who owns to oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries, has seen addition of a staggering $13 billion to his wealth, while Adani group&rsquo;s Gautam Adani, Wipro&rsquo;s Azim Premji and RK Damani &ndash; owner of recently listed Avenue Supermarts &ndash; have seen their wealth swell by anywhere between $3-4 billion this calendar, Bloomberg data showed.\n Shares of Reliance Industries have been ruling at a nine-year high. At last count, the company commanded a market capitalisation of Rs 5,25,000 crore.\n\n&ldquo;Following many years of investment lull in the core business, a grandiose $20 billion push in highly competitive projects has begun to yield results; notably, US ethane with an estimated RoCE of 18 per cent; mega PX project (2.2MMT) and the forthcoming integrated petcoke gasification plant with combined RoCE of 17 per cent. Commissioning of these projects will turn around FCF and double profits in 5 years,&rdquo; brokerage Edelweiss Securities said in a note.\n\n&ldquo;Successful launch of Reliance Jio enhances our confidence on the group. Moreover, RIL&rsquo;s organised retail business has pleasantly surprised us with robust profit growth,&rdquo; the brokerage said.\n\nAzim Premji, who promotes Wipro and has stake in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance (4 per cent) and whose trust Azim Premji Trust has small stakes in NCC (2.47 per cent), Jubilant FoodWorks (2.32 per cent, Schneider Electric (2.01 per cent) Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals (1.53 per cent) and JM Financial (2.40 per cent) has seen his wealth rise by $3.8 billion to $16 billion this year.\n\nIn June this year, Gautam Adani said his company would start work on the $16.5 billion Carmichael coal project in Australia after its board approved the investment. The project was stalled due to local protest on its likely environment impact, especially on the Great Barrier Reef. Adani&rsquo;s Australian unit in May reached an agreement on royalty payments to the Queensland government.\n\nRadhakishan Damani, whose company Avenue Supermarts have soared 205 per cent on the bourses since its listing in March this year, has seen his fortunes rise by $3.46 billion this year to $5.36 billion.\n Uday Kotak, who promotes the Kotak Mahindra Bank, has seen his wealth swell by $3.22 billion to $10.3 billion.

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The World Bank will help draw up a granular makeover blueprint for the Indian Railways, which is investing Rs 5 lakh crore to transform itself from a colonial-era mass transporter into a strategic platform underpinning growth in Asia&rsquo;s third-biggest economy.\n The multilateral lending agency would partner the 164-year-old railroad network, the world&rsquo;s fourth longest, to help the state transporter with investment and planning, digitisation and technology development, besides establishing a Railway University and the Rail Tariff Authority.\n\nThe bank, which has earlier worked with the Railways for financing the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor Project, will provide advisory services and programme management consultancy for this transformation exercise for 2-3 years.\n\n\"We needed this arrangement to build our capacity and deliver projects on a mission mode. World Bank&rsquo;s expertise would be a great gain,\" a top rail ministry official said.\n Rail minister Suresh Prabhu has drawn up an ambitious plan to transform Railways with an investment of Rs 5 lakh crore in the next four years. For this year, the Railways would spend Rs 1.31 lakh crore to augment capacity.\n\nOn the planning front, the World Bank has proposed to set up an organisation for creating detailed forecasting models, traffic optimization and planning.\n\nLONG-TERM INFRA PLAN\n\"Further, an infrastructure plan for the next 10-15 years, after a detailed analysis on freight and passenger growth expected in India, is also envisaged to be created. The bank would be drawing that up as well,&rdquo; the official said.\n\nIn line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s Digital India programme, the Railways wants to roll out a &lsquo;digital enterprise&rsquo; for which the bank will help integrate architecture and database management across its IT applications.\n\nET View: Sensible!\nIt would be sensible for Railways to tap multilateral funding. Resources should be leveraged from National Investment and Infrastructure Fund. The way ahead is to plan modular projects, which can generate cash reasonably quickly. Railways need to keep a close tab on borrowings, given that operating ratio is in high nineties (over 90% of revenue earmarked for routine expenses). So, resource allocation and prioritising expenditure is important. Hence the rationale to access global expertise for programme management and attendant advisory services. It would optimise resource usage.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Noting that he had carried demonetisation &ldquo;on his shoulders&rdquo;, PM Narendra Modi asked the government&rsquo;s senior most bureaucrats at a recent interaction to do all they can to make the goods and services tax (GST) a success by minutely examining its impact on their departments.\n\nThe reference to his singular role in making demonetisation a success in terms of ensuring the government did not face a popular backlash could have reflected a touch of conceit had it not been for the near unanimity in BJP and among senior ministers that &ldquo;notebandi&rdquo; rode on Modi&rsquo;s credibility.\n Since assuming office, Modi has gradually ramped up the scale of his ambitions after a sedate start. He has mixed an incremental approach with bold measures such as surgical strikes on terror launch pads in September 2016, which broke traditional limitations of confronting Pakistan under a nuclear umbrella.\n The radical decision to scrap high value currency was, by some counts, even more fraught as it ran the risk of stalling the economy, triggering public discontent and angering an entrenched black money-political nexus.\n\nBJP netas believe the PM&rsquo;s popular standing helped lend crucial weight to the government&rsquo;s argument that demonetisation was aimed at tax evaders and uncovering illegal hoards.\n\nWith around 20 months to go before the next Lok Sabha polls, Modi has taken on his biggest political challenge that is likely to occupy the government&rsquo;s attention for much of this year. GST&rsquo;s success can strongly embellish his image as a decisive leader and able implementer while unmet expectations can extract a steep cost.\n\nOfficials said the PM has been determined to make GST work, going over the big picture and minutiae in scores of briefings and appraisals. He did the same while monitoring the effects of demonetisation &mdash; describing his labours as &ldquo;khopdi khapa raha hoon (wracking my brains)&rdquo; at a public meeting &mdash; and is banking on India&rsquo;s biggest tax recast to accelerate the pace of the economy.\n\nUnlike demonetisation, which was shrouded in secrecy, GST has been subject to protracted and tortuous negotiations in full public gaze. Its scope is larger and more lasting and is seen as part of measures that include, but do not stop, at demonetisation.\n The reform has been clothed in the promise that higher compliance and digitisation will deliver low inflation, bigger welfare budgets and moderate tax rates.\n\nThe prime minister will be keenly aware that these are big promises to keep.\n\nThe expectation that GST will deliver cleaner and more efficient growth is key to reversing the current deceleration in the economy in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "\n\n\tIn an exclusive interview with ET Now, P Chidambaram, Former FM says the anti-profiteering clause will lead to tax harassments and is likely to be repealed by the next government that comes to power\n\t\n\tEdited excerpts:\n\t\n\tYou have said this is the dawn of new era, the turn of a century as far as tax payers are concerned. You can hate the GST. You can love it. You can ignore it. But by all accounts, this is a momentous occasion for the Indian economy. It is a big event. Do you regret not to be able to sign it off even though you served as finance minister for various terms?\n\t\n\tI cannot rewrite history. Those who should regret are those who stalled it for seven years. I am happy that the idea that was conceived by the UPA is taking shape, however, imperfect it may be. I am happy that I was able to roll out that, I was able to move GST to a point where it could have been rolled out in about year or so. So overall, I am happy.\n\t\n\tYou are happy overall because eventually an idea that you believe is good for the Indian economy is going to roll out, but what is it that the present government could do or what is that the Finance Minister Jaitley could do to drum up consensus that perhaps the UPA or you could not.\n\t\n\tWell firstly, they have an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha. We did not. Never did.\n\t\n\tBut there was a bargain between states and centre as well.\n\t\n\tLet us start with that. You bargain from a position of strength that you are a government with an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha and therefore bills can be passed in the Lok Sabha, number one. Number two, the consensus was built over a period of time say under Mr Sushil Modi as chairman, then Mr Asim Dasgupta as chairman. State finance minister&rsquo;s council was built from that consensus. In fact, somebody has written that the Modi-Jaitley pair stands on the shoulders of previous PM-FM pairs. So over a period of time, it becomes easier to tie up. The initial consensus building was a difficult part and the UPA steered the GST process to a large extent. We just could not clinch it on the last mile.\n\t\n\tWhat you are essentially saying is this is almost like a baton relay and this is the last lap that the BJP has been able to run. I know you are critical of the Modi government&rsquo;s policies. You have pulled them up. You have criticised them when warranted and you have also praised it when necessary. Where do you believe the credit for rolling out the GST lies? Who will you give credit to?\n\t\n\tI cannot yet give full credit because the GST that will be rolled out from the 1st of Jully is an imperfect GST. They were in great hurry to roll it out on 1st July, ignoring well meaning advice to defer it by two or three months. I suggested we roll it out on October 1. And then too many compromises have been made which have added to the imperfections in the GST and travelling round the country I am absolutely convinced that businesses are not ready, businesses are uncertain. They are apprehensive and in course of time, these imperfections will become visible.\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\n\tI agree with you that imperfections will become visible, but can we ever be fully prepared for a reform like the GST? When you say this is an imperfect GST with its flaws, to begin with will you refute me when I say that perfection cannot be the enemy of good and for all practical purposes, this is the beginning of the GST. We will perhaps improve along the way.\n\t\n\tIf they had put in harder work, if they had taken the opposition parties into confidence, if they had persuaded the opposition party leaders in Parliament to talk to the state governments run by those opposition parties, we could have had a much better GST day after tomorrow. They spoke to the state governments but they did not speak to the leaders of the political parties who are running those governments.\n\t\n\tBut do not the state governments have to be taken into confidence, after all, they are the ones who are giving up a lot of space?\n\t\n\tOf course, they have to be taken into confidence. To make it a more perfect GST, it was necessary to take into confidence the leaders of the political parties who are running the state governments like Congress, CPI(M), SP at that time.\n\t\n\tSo you believe there was a crisis of confidence in the centre while they were reaching out to the states but these were congress. A lot of these governments were Congress run governments. So in some sense the congress party was on board?\n\t\n\tBJP somehow shuns the idea of talking to the Congress.\n\t\n\tBut a lot of these governments and most decisions in the council have been taken by consensus. Very few things have ever been put to vote. In that sense, the Congress has been on board?\n\t\n\tConsensus hides the fact that there are dissenting voices and you have now heard the most powerful dissenting voice from Bengal. Please remember Mr Amit Mitra shares the state finance minister&rsquo;s council and his government is dissenting. His government is boycotting the inaugural function therefore consensus hides the fact that there is dissent.\n\t\n\tWhile there is dissent and while the GST will be a reality, what took the GST so long? Was it political optics, political compulsions, economic fallacy - GST has been in the making for over a decade?\n\t\n\tIt gathered momentum only in about 2006-2007 or so. Then we had the international financial crisis in 2008 which was the main preoccupation of the central government for at least a year or so when Mr Mukherjee was the Finance Minister. It gathered steam again when Mr Mukherjeet introduced the GST constitution amendment bill and I tried to take it forward but the BJP simply stalled it. Between August 2012 and May 2014, the BJP simply refused to let us move forward.\n\t\n\tAnd so there was no GST.\n\t\n\tWe lost 18 months that way.\n\t\n\tYou are a grassroot politician. You go back to your constituency. do you believe a utopian GST the one that the economists propagate is ever going to be possible in this country -- a transparent one tax one India?\n\t\n\tI am not pleading for a utopian GST but the obvious wrinkles could have been removed. For example, number one, we had pleaded for a three rate GST standard rate, a demerit rate, and a concessional rate. We now have almost six or seven rates zero, 3, 5, 12, 18, 28, 40. With cesses added, such a plethora of rates is a deep flaw. The second is the diarchy &ndash; a little more persuasion, a little more discussion, a little more bringing the leaders of the political parties and not simply state finance ministers together holding consultations could have avoided this diarchy.\n\t\n\tYou know how the diarchy is going to work. All tax payers below Rs 1.5 crore turnover will be divided into two categories -- 90% for the states, 10% for the centre and then anyone with the turnover of Rs 1.5 crore will be divided again in the two categories 50% for the states, 50% for the centre. And who will be my tax administrator -- centre or state? Will decide GST in what way? By a lottery. I do not know, by a random number. I do not know and then the worst is if I am doing business in more than one state, I have to register in every state which means if I have a turnover say of more than Rs 1.5 crore in each of my 10 states, now for all I know, the lottery could pick me and put me under the state government, the 50% that goes to the state government which means I will have 10 state governments administering the tax for me. It is quite mind boggling, people are not willing to look into details. I think the diarchy is the second problem.\n\t\n\tThe third problem is that the multifarious taxes and the diarchy and the compromises that you made have still left the large amount of discretion in the tax administrator. Fitments are liable to be interpreted differently. Mr Veerappa Moily asked a very apt question -- biscuit cap, chocolate or biscuit it is because you treat chocolates and biscuits differently the question arises. If you treated chocolates and biscuits the same as far as GST is concerned, this question will not arise. Similarly, too much is left to the discretion of tax administrators. It is quite possible that one state administrator will decide one way and other state administrator will decide another way. And the worst is the anti-profiteering provision.\n\t\n\tI will come to anti-profiteering&hellip;\n\t\n\tThat is draconian measure that was intended to please the CBEC officials and I think it is a grave mistake.\n\t \n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\t\n\tThe wrinkles that you spoke about in the GST, will you not agree with me that they reflect the will of the states who were part of the GST Council, the states who were trying to protect their fiscal turf. In some sense, it is also the will of the Congress Party represented by those states?\n\t\n\tWhich means the states do not believe in the heart of their heart. They do not believe that GST is a more efficient tax. It will capture nearly all transactions and will eventually bring us more revenue. If you do not share that belief, then you are not a votary of GST, you are simply going along with some kind of change the system. You must believe that GST will capture nearly all commercial transactions. You must believe that GST is more efficient tax. You must believe that it will bring you larger revenue.\n\t\n\tIs there also a disconnect between the central leadership of most opposition parties?\n\t\n\tThere is.\n\t\n\tWhy so?\n\t\n\tBecause of the nature of politics, the structure of political parties. Central leadership is weaker today than it was a few years ago and therefore the central leaders can only do so much to bring their state leaderships on board and each state depending on whether it is manufacturing state or a consuming state has different priorities. But I think that they have brought the leaders of the political parties around the table, parallel with discussions with state finance ministers and if the prime minister, the finance minister had engaged the leaders of political parties, so many of these wrinkles could have been ironed out.\n\t\n\tI will turn focus and talk to you specifically about the economic gains from the GST and however imperfect this will be, I am certain that you agree with me when I say this is going to be definitely an improvement over the present messy maze of taxes that exists in India. There were accounts of one of&hellip;\n\t\n\tWell a lot of people think that one large mess is being replaced by a small mess.\n\t\n\tA smaller mess is better than a large mess.\n\t\n\tWell a smaller mess is indeed better than a large mess but a mess is a mess.\n\t\n\tWill that mess allude to economic gains? There were various kinds of projections made that there will be a 1.5-2% GDP growth and about 0.9-0.8% addition in the short term. What are the economic gains that you envisage from the GST and do not say none?\n\t\n\tI am not saying none, why do you anticipate my answer? These are purely speculative numbers. I believe GST is a more efficient tax because it captures nearly all transactions which were outside one tax net or the other and it avoids cascading of taxes. If you administer one tax rather than a dozen taxes; excise duty, service tax, VAT, luxury tax, octroi, entry tax etc, it makes for a far simpler administration and the finance minister of states have a much better control over the tax administration and tax collection.\n\t\n\tClearly, GST itself is a gain for India. Now what it will bring in terms of GDP growth I cannot say. In the initial stages, there will be attempts to avoid GST, for example, people will try to keep their turnover below Rs 20 lakh to get out of the tax net. People will try to, you know the Indian jugaad way of trying to find some way out of the GST. Initially, there will be a few gains but in the long run GST should, if all goes well, if things fall in place, if some of the wrinkles that I spoke about are ironed out in the course of time and the states become more confident of administering GST, it should add to GDP growth.\n\t\n\tLet us talk about the anti-profiteering clause that you seem to be very perturbed about. The whole idea of anti-profiteering is that the benefits should be passed on and it should not be inflationary and the consumer should stand to gain. Why are you objecting to it?\n\t This is a complete ignorance of economics. Tax is not the only thing that makes up costs, tax on goods and price of goods are two different matters. Input cost can go up, transport cost can go up, simply competition can drive down prices, lack of competition can drive up prices, increased demand can drive up prices. If there are internationally traded goods, imports can dampen prices, a fall in imports can increase prices. It is absurd to assume that the element of tax will decide at what price I sell my goods. It is one element and if the element of tax falls, it does not mean there should be a corresponding reduction in prices. This reflects something which I have always said that this government just does not believe in a market economy. This government does not believe in market forces. It pretends to be business friendly, it is certainly not faithful to the market idea.\n\t\n\tWhen you say that tax is one of the components of cost but the government has to take care of even that one component which is under its control?\n\t\n\tCompetition will take care of it. If you do not pass on the benefits of input tax credit or lower tax rate to the consumer in the same market with the same product and I see an opportunity, I will reduce my prices.\n\t\n\tAre you scared that this could lead to tax harassment?\n\t\n\tOf course it will. In fact, it is in a way pandering to the CBEC. The officials of CBEC revolted when they had to share the so called tax sovereignty with the state governments which is why this clumsy arrangement of 50% for states and 50% for centre, 90% for states and 10% for centre. Be that as it may, therefore they have given them this anti profiteering weapon. It is completely outdated, contrary to all principles of economics, it should go and take it from me the next government whoever it is will repeal this clause.\n\t\n\tThat is a strong statement that this clause will be repealed.\n\t\n\tIt should be repealed by them, if they do not, it will be repealed by the next government. There is a Competition Commission, there is a consumer forum, they will address these issues of anti competitive practices.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The statistics ministry is set to change the base year of national accounts to 2017-18 from 2011-12 after completion of the household consumer expenditure survey and labour force data by the end of 2018.\n \"My ministry has planned to revise the base year of National Accounts Statistics to 2017-18. The preparatory work for this huge exercise has been started,\" Statistics Minister D V Sadananda Gowda told reporters while addressing a press conference on the government's performance in last three years.\n Elaborating on this, Chief Statistician T C A Anant said, \"Once the results of employment survey and household consumer expenditure survey come out then base year can be changed. Those are critical inputs into the base revision\".\n He also expressed hope for the economy growing at faster pace in April-June quarter on the back of good Monsoon and policy steps.\n\nAnant said that the new labour force survey and household consumer expenditure survey will be available by 2018.\n\nHe informed that the household consumer expenditure survey is taking place in 2017-18 and it will be completed by end of June 2018.\n\nOn the labour force survey, he said, \"We expect to release results of labour force (employment) survey from December 2018 for which the work was started in April, 2017\".\n Earlier in 2015, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) under the Statistics Ministry had changed the base year for tabulating the Gross Domestic Product or size of economy to 2011-12 from 2004-05.\n Last month, the CSO has changed the base of Index of Industrial Production (IIP), which measures factory output, to 2011-12 from 2004-05. Besides, the base year of Wholesale Price Index (WPI) has also been changed to 2011-12 from 2004- 05.\n\nThe minister also told reporters that CSO is planning to to develop a portal for collecting data, which will considerably reduce the time lag in release of the monthly index from the current 42 days.\n\nHe also said, \"We are exploring 'development of a fact- sheet on Indian economy'. This aims at providing a national fact-sheet, wherein various sources in ministries will provide quarterly data on 100 important indicators of Indian economy through a dynamic user-friendly dashboard. Such a national fact-sheet will facilitate decision making at the senior levels of the government\".\n\nAccording to the minister, the ministry is also exploring the possibility of conducting an annual survey of services sector, similar to the Annual Survey of Industries.\n\nAnant told reporters that the household expenditure survey will also consider online spending by the families.\n\nThe minister was of the view that the ministry's effort on infrastructure project monitoring resulted in the reduction of cost overruns from 19 per cent in March 2014 to 11.2 per cent in January 2017.\n\nIn 2017-18, NSSO will undertake surveys on household consumer expenditure and household consumer expenditure on education and health, he further said.\n\nIn 2018, surveys on disability, and Sanitation, hygiene and housing have been planned. To assess the conditions of farmers and villagers, a situation assessment survey of agricultural households, and a debt &amp; investment survey are proposed to be undertaken in 2019, he added.\n\nOn the spending under the members of Parliament local area development (MPLAD) scheme, he said 90 per cent of the funds are utilised under the MPLAD scheme across the country.\n\nUnder the MPLAD scheme, the MPs get Rs five crore per annum for various developmental works in their constituencies.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today hinted that the tax rate on hybrid cars will not be reviewed, saying the industry demands were not in sync with a study conducted by tax officers.\n The council had fixed 43 per cent tax (28 per cent GST plus 15 per cent cess) on hybrid cars, a rate that industry felt was too high for the fuel efficient vehicles.\n\n\"We have done a detailed study on auto industry demand and a paper has been made which will be circulated among members. And, if necessary, it would come up for discussion. The fact that is being presented (by the industry), according to the paper, is not correct,\" Jaitley told reporters.\n\nThe GST Council, chaired by the Union Finance Minister and having state counterparts as members, today lowered tax rates on 66 of the 133 items demanded by various sections of the industry.\n\nThe council in its previous two meetings had put almost all good and services in the tax brackets of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent as it prepares to roll out the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1.\n\nJaitley said the weighted average of all the rates decided by the council is significantly lower than the present tax incidence.\n\nAsked if there would be any further revision of rates, the minister said the fitment committee and the GST Council have gone into the depth of all the cases and whatever rates have been decided are based on \"informed reasons\" and \"detailed discussions\".\n\n\"These broadly are the final rates... just because somebody raises an issue does not mean you have to grant it,\" he said.\n\nThe automakers in their demand to the GST Council had asked it to reduce the tax rate on hybrid vehicles to 18 per cent, arguing that they are much more efficient and eco- friendly but require scale and volume to become economically viable.\n\nAs per the proposed rates under the GST regime, hybrid vehicles have been put in the same category as big petrol and diesel luxury cars attracting 28 per cent rate with a cess of 15 per cent.\n\nThe tax incidence on hybrid vehicles will go up to 43 per cent from the current effective tax rate of 30.3 per cent.\n\nAt present, hybrid vehicles attract excise duty of 12.5 per cent, similar to entry-level small cars such as Tata Nano or Maruti Alto.\n\nEven though hybrid cars are exempt from infrastructure cess, there is a 1 per cent National Calamity Contingent Duty, 2 per cent Central Sales Tax and 12.5 per cent VAT, which takes the total incidence to 30.3 per cent.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "New Delhi: While the economy is growing at just over 7 per cent per year, jobs increased by just 1.1 per cent last year, according to a recently-released report covering eight key sectors of the non-farm economy. An earlier report had pegged joblessness at a five year high of 5 per cent in 2015, and under-employment at a staggering 35 per cent of the over-15 years labour force.\n Seen in this context, the government is facing a growing employment crisis which its various initiatives are unable to address.\n\nBoth reports are based on large surveys carried out by the Labour Bureau. Job growth is tracked by a revamped quarterly survey of over 10,000 units while unemployment is recorded in an annual survey of 7.8 lakh people. The new quarterly survey started in April 2016 and replaced an earlier one which covered certain export-oriented sectors.\n\n\n\nProviding decent jobs was one of the most popular promises which swept the Modi-led BJP to office in 2014 and helped it win several state elections.\n\nMost recently, Yogi Adityanath too had promised to address the jobs situation in UP after being anointed the chief minister following BJP's dramatic victory in the state assembly elections.UP itself has an estimated 1 crore unemployed, according to the report. Recent reports of several IT and BPO majors shedding jobs have added to the worries of people, especially urban middle-class families which had been riding the IT boom. Global slowdown in IT services and components and new visa restrictions are thought to be behind this.\n\nSeveral other indicators explain this painful situation. Gross credit given to industry has grown by just 6.7% in the past three years, the index of industrial production has inched up by just 6% and growth in gross fixed capital formation slipped to an alarmingly low 0.6% in January this year compared to 6.1% last year.\n A total of 2.3 lakh jobs were added to the eight sectors covered in the quarterly survey including manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation and restaurants, ITBPO, education and health.\n\nNearly half of the new jobs added were in education and health. Both these sectors are known for low paying jobs. Construction and the hospitalityfood sectors showed loss of jobs, the most serious ones, amounting to a dip of nearly 7%, is in construction.\n\nOne usually neglected aspect of India's unemployment crisis is of under-employment or concealed unemployment. This is of two types -not finding work for full year and work at very low wages. The Labour Bureau's 2016 report on unemployment paints a dire picture of both fronts.\n\nOnly 61% of people in the workforce were found to have year-round jobs with 34% working only 6-11 months even though they were willing to work for 12 months.\n\nThe report also revealed that 68% households were earning only Rs 10,000 per month or less. In all, nearly 16 crore people in the workforce were under-employed in this manner.\n\n",

The strength is the same in 2017 as in the late 80s,&rdquo; Pronob Sen, former chief statistician and chairman of the National Statistical Commission told TOI.\n &ldquo;It is difficult to retain good statisticians and the quality of those entering the Indian Statistical Service has declined,&rdquo; said Sen. He said good statisticians are lapped up by financial services firms or prefer to go abroad.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need to overhaul the way statistics is taught at universities and called for a relook at the incentive structure to attract top notch statisticians for government duties.\n\nEconomists say key macroeconomic indicators need to be revised at a faster pace to reflect changes in the economy.\n\nThey point out that the revision to IIP and the wholesale price index unveiled on Friday is already six years late and work has to start immediately to shift to a new base year.\n\nThe report suggests the government will have to tackle the resource crunch on a war footing to get reliable and credible statistics.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "\n New York: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has asserted that the government was giving top priority to addressing the issue of bad loans while acknowledging that the problem of non-performing assets was \"adversely impacting\" the Indian banking system.\n\n\tSpeaking at the Council on Foreign Relations here, Jaitley termed the resolution of the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) as the \"one very big challenge\" going forward and the government's \"top priority\" at the moment.\n\n\tHe said the magnitude of the NPAs problem was that essentially it was about 20 to 30 big accounts.\n \"It's not a problem spread over hundreds of thousands of accounts...And it's not impossible for a large economy like India to resolve 20 to 30 accounts. So it's not an insurmountable problem. I think it's just persisted too long, but it's certainly adversely impacting us,\" he said.\n\n\t\"So if you were to ask me, there are a series of reforms/changes which we've successfully made. This is one hurdle which we are now required to jump, and that's where our current focus is,\" he said yesterday.\n\n\tHowever, Jaitley said there was one constraint the government was facing.\n\n\t\"It's not a constraint on the leadership quality in the bank, but it's a constraint on the environment in which the bank bureaucracy functions. I have seen that the banks are not bold enough to take their decisions because...our anti- corruption law is still a pre-liberalisation law,\" he said.\n\n\tJaitley emphasised that one of the fundamental flaws in the anti-corruption law has been that erroneous decision- making, which may be taking hair cuts in order to settle, gets identified as an act of corruption.\n\n\tThe parliamentary committee has unanimously recommended that this be corrected, he said.\n\n\t\"And this is at the final stage now. The recommendation of a larger consensus parliamentary committee has come. Hopefully, in the next session we will take this up,\" he said.\n\n\t\"The bank bureaucracy is going to be -- or, for that matter, any bureaucracy or a public servant dealing with economic decisions, then they can decide on commercial considerations rather than be constrained as to the future consequences of their action itself,\" Jaitley said.\n\n\t\"So the decision between a possible commercial decision being treated as an act of corruption, I think that the law has to eliminate that possibility,\" he said.\n The Reserve Bank of India has come out with several guidelines and schemes under which the banks have been empowered, Jaitley said.\n\n\tOutlining these schemes, Jaitley said there was an insolvency law in place and there was another action which the government has in the pipeline in order to resolve this.\n\n\t\"Essentially, it would also mean that the defaulting companies will have to find partners, will have to go in for either change of managements, they'll have to get investors. And some precipitative action will be taken. This may also involve some hair cuts by the banks, which would be a bona fide commercial consideration,\" Jailtey said.\n\n\tHe noted that Indian banks, particularly public sector banks, have conventionally lent for both infrastructure and industry, rather than just retail lending.\n\n\t\"Now, during the boom period and thereafter, there was lending in several sectors. And because of the global downturn and those sectors being impacted, you found an adverse impact on some of those sectors,\" he said.\n Further, he stressed that as a combined impact of the GST, demonetisation and several other steps, the government has taken, revenues in India are increasing quite rapidly.\n\n\t\"In fact, in the last three years, despite global slowdown, India has consistently seen 15 to 18 per cent annual revenue growth, which is quite significant.\n\"And therefore, I do see over the next several years this revenue growth, particularly as the result of GST and the anti-evasion measures we've been taking, rapidly increasing,\" he said.

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Having seen a \"modest setback\" due to demonetisation last fiscal, the Indian economy will claw back to 7.2 per cent growth this financial year and rise further to 7.5 per cent in 2018-19, says a World Bank report.\n In its report on South Asian Economy, the World Bank said that \"significant risks\" to economic growth could emanate from fallout of demonetisation on small and informal economy, stress in the financial sector and uncertainty in global environment.\n Also, a rapid increase in oil and other commodity prices could have a negative implication for the economy, it added.\n\nThe country's economic growth is expected to see an uptick at 7.2 per cent this fiscal and further accelerate to 7.5 per cent in 2018-19, the report said.\n The growth slowed down to 6.8 per cent in 2016-17 due to a combination of weak investments and the impact of demonetisation, the World Bank said, adding that timely and smooth implementation of the GST could prove to be a significant \"upside risk\" to economic activity in 2017-18.\n\nAs per the report, the economic growth is projected to increase gradually to 7.7 per cent by 2019-20, underpinned by a recovery in private investments, which are expected to be crowded in by the recent increase in public capex and an improvement in the investment climate.\n\n\"India's economic momentum suffered a modest setback due to demonetisation, while the poor and vulnerable likely witnessed a larger negative shock. The economy is expected to recover and growth will gradually accelerate to 7.7 per cent by 2019-20,\" it said.\n\nThe demonetisation, the World Bank said, caused an immediate cash crunch, and activity in cash reliant sectors was affected.\n\nThe GDP growth slowed to 7 per cent during the third quarter of 2016-17, from 7.3 per cent during the first half of the fiscal.\n\nIndia's fiscal, inflation and external conditions are expected to remain stable, the US-based multilateral lending agency said, adding that the centre will continue to consolidate modestly, while retaining the push towards infrastructure spending.\n\n\"Inflation will stabilise, supported by favourable weather and structural reforms. Normal monsoons have so far offset increases in petroleum prices,\" it said.\n\nReferring to the external factor, it said exchange rate has appreciated, partly reflecting expectations of a narrowing inflation gap between India and the US and limited external vulnerabilities as the current account deficit is expected to remain below 2 per cent of the GDP and fully financed by FDI inflows.\n\nIt said challenges to India's favourable growth outlook could stem from continued uncertainties in the global environment, including rising global protectionism and a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy, which could further delay a meaningful recovery of external demand.\n\nIt said there is a great uncertainty about the extent to which demonetisation caused small, informal firms to exit and shed jobs. Also, private investment continues to face several impediments in the form of corporate debt overhang, stress in the financial sector, excess capacity and regulatory and policy challenges.\n\n",

The JSPL Chairman also says all the developed countries follow the GST model and that it would be good for the country.\n\nEdited excerpts:\n\nWhat are you expecting from GST?\n\nWe are hoping that GST would make things easier, we see so many times the trucks standing at the state borders. All those things will stop and the movement of goods will become faster. All the developed countries follow the GST model. I feel it would be good for the country.\n\nWe are talking at a time when the Indian government has decided to do away with the minimum import price for steel. However, they should have anti-dumping duties on a few steel products. If you had to advice the government, the commerce ministry on this. what would you say?\n We appreciate the efforts of the Government of India for protecting the steel industry at various times. The government brought out minimum import price and most of those have been replaced by anti-dumping duties which is the right step and we really appreciate this effort of the government which has saved the Indian industry.\n\nThe Finance Minister has also alluded to a comprehensive policy framework to take care of the bad loans. The NPAs are one black hole that we have in the economy and it is going to impact a lot of companies including yours. What would your advice to the government be? How can this framework be a major success?\n\nDefinitely because a lot of industries have really suffered a huge setback at the cancellation of 2G licences or due to cancelation of all the coal blocks. So all the power plants, steel plants that were based on these coal blocks have really been ruined. So to expect things to be normal for them is very difficult. It is not because of their fault that they are in this position. The government has to realise that and on a case by case basis, they must help out these companies because after all these companies have set up large power plants, steel plants or cement plants. Whatever their genuine concerns are, those must be addressed and the banks also have to be very understanding and helpful.\n\nDo you think a policy framework would be the right way to go ahead because no bank will take a haircut or no corporate will take a haircut but if everybody sits together and decide on a onetime settlement or a haircut, they can move forward?\n\nRight. And whatever needs to be done should be done fast because sometimes banks for the fear of problems later on, stops doing anything. If the banks get together and decide and the government also approves it, it will be done faster. It is very important to have clear cut policies and banks and the government also must help out the companies who without any fault of theirs are in these problems today.\n\nDo you think companies will also be ready to sell assets at a cheaper value?\n\nOf course. Companies have been doing whatever they can. We have sold whatever we could sell and now just have our core assets.\n\nWhat about all these reports that you are in talks with JSW? Would like to say anything on that?\n\nSo, that is progressing well. We are selling our 1000 megawatt power plant to JSW and that is going well. It takes a long time to get all the permissions, clearances.\n\nBut anything about the valuations that you can tell us?\n\nValuation is a complicated formula depending on how much PPAs we have, what kind of return we can offer to them. So it is anyway between Rs 4000 crore to Rs 6000 crore.\n\nWhat kind of a timeline are both of you brothers targeting?\n\nBy June next year.\n\nThat will really help the banks as well because if you get about Rs 4000-5000 crore\n\nBut actually banks are not in any kind of problem in case of JSPL. No bank is going to lose even a single paisa. JSPL has always taken care of its commitments. Obviously, there is some delay in certain payments but all the banks have been getting their repayments, their interest payments. There&rsquo;s just a couple of months delay in the system.\n\n",

GDP growth was 7.3 percent in the previous quarter.\n\nChief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian last month said the official GDP figures may not fully reflect the \"real and significant hardships\" experienced by the informal sector, in which an estimated nine out of 10 Indian workers are employed.\n\nBut the pain, according to Centre, will be short-lived.\n Earlier, Paris-based think tank OECD today cut India's growth forecast to 7 per cent for 2016-17 in view of demonetisation, but said the pace will accelerate to 7.3 per cent in the next fiscal.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had in February last year projected the country's economy to expand at 7.4 per cent in 2016-17.\n \"India has been a star performer in gloomy times. We do not have many cases of 7 per cent growth... It is a top reformer among all the G-20 countries,\" OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria told reporters here.\n\nThe organisation forecast the country's economic growth to rise further to 7.7 per cent in 2018-19.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW YORK: The exact dollar value of Saudi Aramco may be up for debate, but the listing of the world's biggest company will be priceless for the kingdom's markets.\n The highly-anticipated share sale has become emblematic of Saudi Arabia's push to transform its economy and open its doors to more foreign capital. Whatever you think of the valuations involved -be it the $2 trillion once suggested by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or the $400 billion estimate said to have been made by consultant Wood Mackenzie -the offering has the potential to make waves in markets from Tokyo to Toronto.\n\nAramco's &ldquo;partial privatisation will bring much attention on Saudi Arabia,\" said Michael Bolliger, the Zurich-based head of emerging-market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management, which has clients worth $2.1 trillion. Here's a look at how Aramco's listing may impact markets:\n\nSTOCK MARKETS Saudi Arabia's domestic stock exchange, known as the Tadawul, has a total market capitalisation of about $440 billion, making it the largest in the Middle East. A sale of just 5% of Aramco could raise more than $100 billion, according to some estimates. That would crown it as the biggest listing ever but also mean absorption of the whole deal on the local exchange would be near impossible.\n\n\n\nSTOCK INDEXES The largest IPO in history will have an impact even beyond where it's listed, rippling through the benchmark stock gauges tracked by investors globally.Saudi Arabia expects MSCI Emerging Markets Index inclusion in the near future, the exchange's chief executive officer said on Sunday.\n\nAssuming a 5% float, Aramco alone would account for about 2.4% of the gauge, according to estimates by Mohamad Al Hajj, a Dubai-based equity strategist.\n\nOIL PRICES\nThe key to Aramco's IPO price -and the success of its offering-will be the value of crude. Even with the global shift to cleaner fuels, oil is expected to continue providing about a third of world energy for the next two decades.\n\nCURRENCIES\nForeign reserves held by the Saudi Monetary Agency have dropped $200 billion since August 2014 to $528 billion at the end of Dec, as the kingdom used savings to shore up public finance.\n\n",

Diesel use, which accounts for about 40 percent of total fuel demand in India, dropped 7.8 percent to 5.8 million tons, the biggest decline since September. Gasoline consumption fell the most since June.\n\n\n Expansion in the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing major economy is under pressure after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November withdrew high-value currency notes in a country where almost all consumer payments are in cash. Growth in gross domestic product may slow to 6.5 percent in the year through March from 7.9 percent the previous year, according to an Economic Survey presented by the finance minister&rsquo;s advisers.\n\n&ldquo;This decline in demand is due to demonetization,&rdquo; according to Tushar Tarun Bansal, director at Ivy Global Energy. &ldquo;I would expect this decline to be a one off and dissipate from February. This should result in a slower demand growth for diesel in the first quarter in 2017.&rdquo;\n\nPetcoke consumption fell for the first time in more than a year, declining about 9.9 percent to 1.95 million tons. Gasoline consumption fell 0.6 percent to 1.8 million tons. Liquefied petroleum gas use expanded 16.4 percent to 2 million tons, while jet fuel demand increased 17.8 percent to 627,000 tons.\n\n",

Perhaps testing how far he would go.\n\n\tDespite being leaders of only about 13% of the world's Muslims who are Shia, Iran's leadership has been able to give the dominant Sunnis a run for their money.

Iran has roped in Russia for the pitiless strikes, and therein lies the rub for Trump. If he tears up the Iranian deal, will he still be able to romance Putin?\n Trump sees Islamic State as a clear and distinct threat. He wants Russia to help him knock out IS. IS is all Sunni. Not a single Shia has been suspected of bombings in the US or Europe since 9/11. In Trump's mind every Syrian refugee, almost invariably Sunni, is a threat.\n\n\tTrump has also to make nice with Israel. Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and alter ego, is an orthodox Jew, who has, wonder of wonders, been given charge of Israeli-Palestinian relations. Guess who he's going to support? The Saudis have proven to be reliable friends of the Israelis, so they cannot be jettisoned either.\n\n\tIn this combustible mix of the US, Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia lies the future of the world's oil. The current oil price is $54 a barrel, double what it was a year ago. Average price for 2016: $43. Will prices keep rising, hold steady or fall?\n The US Energy Administration Agency claims that the country has proven shale oil reserves of about 20 billion barrels, a figure dwarfed by Canadian and Venezuelan oil sands reserves of 350 billion barrels. With Trump approving the Keystone pipeline, expect 800,000 barrels of Canadian oil to gush daily through America in a few years. America is awash in oil.\n\n\tA huge fall in demand at the world's biggest consumer, the US, made the oil-producing cartel Opec's inventory stack up. And up. Prices fell through the floor. Saudi Arabia which has traditionally called the shots at Opec pushed for a cut. But increasingly Iran, and its ally Iraq, wield more influence.\n\n\tFinally each got what it was looking for. Opec would reduce its output by 1.2 million barrels a day by January 2017, with the Saudis cutting by half a million barrels to 10 million a day. Sanction-starved Iran pushed to increase its quota to 3.8 million a day. Crude jumped to $50 a barrel.\n\n\tChina is an oil producing wannabe. It has shale oil reserves equivalent to those of the US, and has begun drilling for them in earnest. There then seems to be a glut of oil in the world.\n In case Trump lets the Iran deal be, and with the world economy picking up steadily, oil should hover around $60 a barrel in 2017. If Trump does not honour the deal, Iran could not be sanctioned, and it would continue producing oil at new levels. Once again, oil should stay the same barring a cataclysmic event such as an attack on Iran.\n\n\tWould oil go lower than today in the rest of 2017? Unlikely, because Keystone won't kick in for a few years, and so too Chinese oil. With production steady and demand relatively so, expect oil not to dip.\n\n\tWhat are the implications for India? The EIA sent a considerable team to India that estimated its shale oil resources at 4 billion barrels, and posted its methodology on its web site. I have not seen any equivalent Indian study. Hydraulic fracturing is a complex process but easily learned. India should forthwith tap its shale resources.\n While oil prices remain relatively low, the government must think about deregulating the sector and letting wholesale prices be reflected at the pump. Gouging oil for tax makes for easy money. It also makes the government lazy in mopping up the right kind of money. If we are a tax noncompliant society, whose fault is it? Why isn't tax collection as foolproof as counting votes are?\n\n\tFinally, New Delhi has done a hash of a job by abandoning old friends like Russia and failing to cultivate new ones like America. All prime ministers want to run foreign policy, but no prime minister since Nehru has wanted to own it like Modi. The minister for foreign affairs has been reduced to being the minister for twitter affairs.\n Construction magnates, builders, real estate moguls have taken over a shell-shocked Washington. With Trump, politics is all about personal chemistry. Why not send the external affairs minister to Washington as ambassador? She is quite capable of striking a rapport with the Trumpians. Easy access to American oil and gas, as well as to discovery and drilling knowhow, should top her agenda.\n\n\tThe writer is an energy expert\n\n",

In a country where 25-30 per cent of the economy is informal, GDP is bound to be affected,\" he said.\n The Centre has been under constant attack from the Opposition and economists since Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes shall be discontinued from the circulation by the end of 2016.\n\nThe government insists that the step was taken to control black economy and terror funding in the country.\n\nGoyal criticised the Opposition and made a veiled attack on West Bengal. \"In the entire country, there is only one state, which despite two years of persuasion by central government, has not yet agreed to join the 24/7 power-for-all,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed on transparency in the regulatory process, insisting that policy makers and regulators must work together.\n \"Regulators should be open about their working. Orders should be available in public domain so that others can benchmark their business processes to whatever is decided by regulators,\" he said. He also stressed on the simplicity of regulations so that the common man could understand the process better.\n Earlier in the day finance minister Arun Jaitley said in a separate event in Gandhinagar that the government has been working towards ease of doing business. Several steps are being taken to ensure that.\n\nMany foreign investors have been demanding that the Indian government eases the regulatory environment in the country. To some extent, the current government has been able to do so and big ticket litigation in taxation, especially around transfer pricing, have come down drastically.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The government has made absolutely no concession in the way tax authorities deal with political parties, and they will be treated the same way as other offenders if they violate the law, finance minister Arun Jaitley said during the ET Awards ceremony.\n &ldquo;Whatever was the existing system, which has existed for the last 15 years, is continuing and if somebody creates a political party for the purposes of channelising funds, obviously the law will step in,&rdquo; Jaitley said at a panel discussion before an audience of India&rsquo;s biggest business leaders, bankers and CEOs. &ldquo;Hopefully, for the future, political funding will have to be more transparent.&rdquo;\n\nAlso Read: How demonetisation has dealt a body blow to the Big Fat Indian wedding\n Jaitley also said the economy had a lot to gain from digitisation of payments and the withdrawal of high-value bank notes. In this he was strongly supported by Power Minister Piyush Goyal, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari.\n Goyal said demonetisation had triggered a big change in the mindset of Indians. &ldquo;People realise that it doesn&rsquo;t pay to be dishonest,&rdquo; he said.\n He said demonetisation and the shift in thinking that it was bringing about was altering the way people did business and also had a positive impact on revenue collection by state power distribution companies.\n\nAlso Read: Less-cash economy and uniform GST top government priorities, says FM Arun Jaitley\n The minister said he had interacted extensively with the trading community and had received positive feedback from the younger generation. He said the youth are pleased by the country&rsquo;s new environment that&rsquo;s resulted in a level playing field. The shortage of new currency notes has disrupted many sections of the Indian economy, particularly those in the informal sector where deals are struck primarily in cash. Prabhu said a digital revolution was round the corner, but such events do not occur without any disruption.\n\nHe said demonetisation was part of the larger digital revolution strategy, for which a small price had to be paid in the interest of bigger rewards ahead.\n &ldquo;Let us look at little larger picture. We were the largest economy till the first industrial revolution, then came the second one, took us even behind, the third one we missed out. The fourth revolution is going to be the digital revolution and if we can actually embrace it, can ride it and not just see it passing by, we could be the real winners,&rdquo; he said.\n\nAlso Read: Ramanagara district in Karnataka hit with drought in crop and cash\n\nOpposition parties have staunchly opposed the government&rsquo;s move, arguing that the common man has been hit, but Prabhu said rival political parties can play a more constructive role. Prabhu said opposition parties will oppose, but they can also propose, and the government prefers the latter.\n Gadkari, who won the ET Award in the business reformer category for turning around the highways sector, said the government was in a strong position to deal with demonetisation. The minister said he was optimistic about infrastructure projects and the funding available to them. He also made a strong pitch for effective decision making by officials.\n\nGadkari emphasised the need for fasttrack decisions by the administration. He said officials should not delay decisions and added that action should be taken against those who do so.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: India&rsquo;s fuel demand surged 6.7% in October after declining in September, aided by a sharp rise in petrol and diesel consumption.\n The fuel consumption rose 7.8% in the seven months through October this year, according to the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), an oil ministry&rsquo;s arm. A fast expanding Indian economy and a relatively lower fuel prices have boosted demand for oil in India.\n\nIn October, the demand for all oil products rose to 16.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) from 15.5 MMT a year ago.\n\nSeptember was the only month demand for petroleum products fell this year, about 2%. The consumption of petrol fell about 3.5% while that of diesel shrank about 11.5% in September mainly due to the rise in prices and higher base in the same month previous year, PPAC said in its monthly commentary.\n\nPetrol consumption rose 13.8% to 2.1 million tonnes in October. The demand for diesel, which accounts for 40% of all fuels consumed in the country, climbed 5.1% to 6.7 million tonnes. New car purchases, fuelled by the festive season, helped boost demand for petrol and diesel in October.\n\nThe consumption of kerosene, mostly used by rural poor for lighting and cooking, fell by a third in a year to 380,000 metric tonnes in October. The consumption dramatically shrank in just a month from September this year when it was 501,000 tonnes or 31% higher. This is mainly a result of the Centre&rsquo;s decision to cut 5% allocation of subsidized kerosene to states every quarter and some voluntary cuts taken by some states as supply of electricity and cooking gas rise across the country.\n\nThe demand for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), mostly used as cooking gas in millions of Indian homes, expanded 10% in October, as the government drive to take cleaner fuel to more homes intensified. State firms have just completed giving away 1 crore fresh connections to poor households this fiscal year. This addition over an effective base of about 17 crore domestic cooking consumers is expected to give a big boost to LPG consumption.\n\nThe demand for Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) also climbed 9% as a festive season drove up air traffic.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "In an interview with ET Now, AK Sharma, Director-Finance, IOC, talks about the petroleum sector. Edited excerpts: \n\nET Now: Indian petroleum demand at 11%, highest in a decade. What do you think is driving this?\n\nAK Sharma: The growth in the petroleum sector is more driven by the growth in the Indian economy when there is a possibility, and everybody is seeing there is a growth in the Indian economy. The petroleum sector has to be the driving force behind the growth.\n\nSecondly, the lower petroleum prices they have also contributed in the growth particularly the petrol growth, the change in the customers preference from diesel to petrol is driving the growth in the petrol.\n\nET Now: Indian oil companies are still dominating about 97% of the fuel marketing sector how is the overall space growing and within that how much is the IOC space?\n\nAK Sharma: The way the growth is seen in the petroleum sector there is space available for everybody, including the Indian oil and the private sector. We see that with the growth being there and IOC being the dominant player, we will continue to play the role of a dominant player, though there will be space for others also.\n\nAs you can see the way the demand is growing in the country there will be deficit of the petroleum products in the years to come.\n\nET Now: Your EBITDA ex-Paradip would essentially be a very healthy number with crude having recovered almost $10-$11 as well from the lows are these realistic assumptions?\n\nAK Sharma: One is that you have touch upon the crude oil prices, I will say yes the crude oil price the expectation is that these are going to remain somewhere around $50 to that say reasonable assumptions and with that assumption and also assuming that the cracks that is the difference between the crude oil prices and the petroleum product prices. The cracks are going to be in the range of $10 to $11.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the GRMs could be above the level of the $5 in the year and both the assumptions being there but the only thing is that the cracks which if you see the last year particularly in case of the petrol the cracks were very high, very good. As far as diesel was concerned, these were extremely volatile and now the situation is reverse now the cracks on the diesels are fairly okay $10 to $11 while on the petrol are $6 to $7.\n Things keep on changing. It is a international market. It is difficult to make any assumption particularly on the cracks, but with cracks being 10 to 11 and the crude being at this price the GRMs could be good.\n\nET Now: If all of these factors are taken and near normal assumptions for the rest of the year, do you think Rs 10,000 crore of EBITDA Ex-paradip is a realistic possibility for IOC in FY17?\n\nAK Sharma: I would not like to predict on the profits of the company. But yes, I would like to say with the commissioning of the Paradip with the various efficiency improvements measures which were taken by IOC in last one year, particularly the improvement in by more than 1.5% and the drastic improvement in the energy efficiency and the reduction in the cost of the crude by way of adopting various measures for procurements, I think there should be good sign for improvement in the profitability of the company.\n\nWhile it will be difficult for me to predict on the profits, it depends on various sectors, international markets, cracks, crude prices. But I see there are positive developments and IOC definitely should be doing better.\n\nET Now: Highlight for us your borrowing cost. You know by how much have they come down in the last few quarters and what is the outlook now going forward?\n\nAK Sharma: I would like to say that the reduction in the borrowing cost which was almost Rs 3,500 crore last year and has come down to Rs 3,000 crore in the year 15-16.\n\nThe reduction is primarily driven by the reduction in the working capital requirements for the company which is again is a factor of the reduction in the crude oil prices. Working capital requirements have come down.\n\nAnother factor which plays the role is the reduction in the under recovery and our outstanding dues from the government have also come down significantly as a result of the government policies on early reimbursement of the under recoveries on kerosene and LPG to us.\n\nGoing forward, I see the borrowings levels to remain rather lower and the interest cost to be slightly lower than what we have seen.\n\nET Now: Your GRMs of $5.5 to $6 to a barrel in FY17 to FY18 is that a fair estimate?\n\nAK Sharma: As I said earlier, it is difficult to actually predict the GRM because and the profitability because there are various factors as I said the most important factor is the crack between the crude and the product price which is so volatile.\n\nIf the cracks remain in the range of $10 to $11 and crude prices remain at around $50 then probably yes 5 should be doable, 5 plus should be doable but a lot depends on how the cracks move in the international market and what are the timings of those movement of the cracks and the crude prices.\n\nET Now: Government has allowed 25 paisa per litre per month on kerosene as well until March 2017, if I am not wrong. How do you see this impact and do you see the possibility of this continuing post March 2017 or will there be a pause after that because this is an unprecedented step as we all know?\n\nAK Sharma: Yes, this is an unprecedented step but it was long awaited actually and if the step has been taken by government I think they must be having something in mind for this.\n\nThis eventually does not affect the oil companies because ultimately the under recoveries on the government will come down so I think if the decision has been taken by the government they must have given a thoughtful thinking to this and may be a part of the larger reform process which the government has been undertaking for last two years.\n\nET Now: Updates on the Paradip refinery because almost everybody believes that the breakeven GRM will be lower than Bhatinda or Bina and this will help you massive in your margins FY18 onwards can you give us some colour there?\n\nAK Sharma: Paradip is a coastal refinery, which is ideal for any refinery. It will have all the benefits of processing heavy to very heavy crudes and the entirely its high sulphur crude. It will be able to process. Definitely it will have the advantage over the other refineries and it is the most modern state of art refinery in the country.\n\nIt has the best of the technology so we are quite confident that the refinery will turn out to be a very good GRM. It will give a big boost to the IOC&rsquo;s profitability.\n\nWe will have to give this year for the refinery to get stabilised because one after the another unit are getting commissioned and by the year end on an average refinery should be running at more than 70% on an year average while by the end of the year it may go more than 80. But on average basis it should be running at 70% but it is runs on an average more than 90% or 100%.\n\nThe full potential of the Paradip in terms of the GRM will be visible on the Indian oil balance sheet, Indian oil profitability and I am quite hopeful for that.\n\n",

Aviation turbine fuel consumption grew 20% as lower prices and holiday travels boosted air traffic. Except for kerosene and naphtha, the consumption of all other petroleum products went up during the month.\n\nDomestic output of oil and gas, however, did not pick up. In May, local crude oil production declined 3.3% to 3.1 million metric tonnes from a year ago. Natural gas production fell 6.9% to 2,656 million metric standard cubic meters. Increasing gas demand in the country was met by increased import of liquefied natural gas. India imported 2082 MMSCM of LNG, 43% more than it did a year ago.\n\nThe government has set a target to bring down oil imports to 67% of total consumption by 2022.\n\nAccording to the Petroleum Planning &amp; Analysis Cell&rsquo;s estimate, India&rsquo;s crude oil import will increase 2% to $66 billion in 2016-17 from $64 billion in the previous financial year considering crude oil price of $45 per barrel for the Indian basket and an exchange rate of Rs 67 to a dollar for the remaining part of this fiscal.\n\nThe prices of Brent crude averaged $46.88 per barrel in May, compared to $41.48 in April. The Indian basket crude oil averaged $44.97 per barrel in May, significantly higher than $39.85 a barrel in the previous month.\n\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Crude oil surged 1.06 per cent to Rs 3,432 per barrel in futures market today as speculators engaged in creating speculative positions, taking positive cues from Asian markets.\n At Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for delivery in June contract was trading higher by Rs 36 or 1.06 per cent to Rs 3,432 per barrel in a business turnover of 2,608 lots.\n\nLikewise, the oil for delivery in July gained Rs 33 or 0.96 per cent to Rs 3,484 per barrel in 157 lots.\n Analysts said speculative positions created by traders after crude prices extended gains to multi-month highs in Asia today following another drop in the US supplies and the prospect of further disruptions to output from key producer in Nigeria, mainly influenced crude futures here.\n The commodity has almost doubled since hitting near 13-year low at the start of the year as a global supply glut eased thanks chiefly to a weakening dollar, signs of a pick-up in the world economy and falling production from Nigeria and Canada.\n\nYesterday, the Department of Energy said the US commercial stocks fell much more than expected in the week to June 3, fanning talk that demand is improving in the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nMeanwhile, West Texas Intermediate gained 32 cents or 0.62 per cent to USD 51.55, its highest since July, while global benchmark Brent advanced 22 cents or 0.42 per cent to USD 52.73 a barrel, its highest since October.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: With just two days to go before Prime Minister Narendra Modi completes his second year in office, &lsquo;Acche Din&rsquo; still looks distant for equity investors.\n\nData compiled by ETMarkets.com showed investors of 15 top Indian corporate houses have cumulatively lost 17 per cent of their wealth ever since Modi took over as the 15th Prime Minister of India on May 26, 2014.\n\nAs of today, these 15 corporate houses have combined market value in excess of Rs 31 lakh crore, which is about one-third of BSE&rsquo;s current market capitalisation at Rs 96 lakh crore.\n\nThe combined market wealth of these corporate houses stood at Rs 37.44 lakh crore the day Modi took oath as PM and Rs 36.5 lakh crore at the end of his first year in office.\n Leading corporate houses such as Ambanis, Adanis, Jindals, Anil Agarwal&rsquo;s Vedanta and Anil Ambani&rsquo;s Adag have seen up to 51 per cent erosion in their market values ever since Modi took office.\n\nA slump in commodity prices globally and risk-off trade in emerging markets were main culprits behind the poor show. Earnings growth, too, took a hit due to delay in key reforms on the government side.\n\n\n\n&ldquo;Valuations were bid up very high initially in the hope that major changes would be unleashed by the new government. They were factoring in expected earnings growth before hand,&rdquo; said Siddharth Oberoi, founder at Prudent Equity.\n\nFour listed companies of Gautam Adani-led Adani group (including Adani Transmission) have a total market capitalisation of Rs 57,150 crore today, down 51 per cent from Rs 1,17,388 crore that three group firms enjoyed on May 26, 2014. Anil Ambani&rsquo;s Adag group saw a 44 per cent plunge in the group&rsquo;s market value to Rs 49,081 crore.\n\nThe public sector firms witnessed a 26 per cent fall in their combined market cap to Rs 13.19 lakh crore in these two years.\n\nAmong the commodity-focused groups, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance group witnessed a 15 per cent fall in market value, Om Prakash Jindal&rsquo;s Jindal group saw a 31 per cent squeeze, while Anil Agarwal&rsquo;s Vedanta group has seen its combined market cap shrink 43 per cent to Rs 1.22 lakh crore. For Agarwal, the value was lower than the Rs 1.68 lakh crore market cap that the group commanded before the Modi Euphoria kicked in.\n &ldquo;There has been a deceleration in the global economy in last two years with frequent downward revisions of growth forecasts by various rating agencies across the globe. In the same period, the US has delivered better corporate earnings than most emerging markets, which have been plagued by negative earnings growth, largely due to a crash in commodities,&rdquo; Dharmesh Kant, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Securities, told ETMarkets.com.\n\nThe BSE Sensex gained a mere 2 per cent during the period. Kant said the underperformance of the index can be attributed mainly to global headwinds and to some extent slow pace of reforms, particularly those that can throw up instant results, such as the GST.\n\n&ldquo;With the fiscal position in a shambles and consumer inflation in double digits, the present government inherited an economy whose macro fundamentals were doddering and India was on the verge of a ratings downgrade to junk status. The country's progress from those macro-economic depths has been a Herculean achievement over a short span of two years,&rdquo; Ajay Bodke, CEO &amp; Chief Portfolio Manager, Prabhudas Lilladher, told ETMarkets.com.\n\nSome corporate biggies still managed to raise their valuations through these challenges.\n\nThe most valued Tata group has seen a 9.5 per cent rise in market value to Rs 7,83,748 crore during the two-year period. Sunil Mittal&rsquo;s Bharti Enterprises has seen a 16 per cent rise in market capitalisation, Ajay Piramal&rsquo;s companies have gained 109 per cent, BK Birla firms 43 per cent and KK Birla group 21 per cent.\n\n&ldquo;All the ingredients for a strong long-term upward move are in place and the arrival of monsoon will act as the trigger for a takeoff,&rdquo; Bodke said.\n\nKant said given the vulnerability of the market to global shocks, the government has done a remarkable job in managing the currency war and effectively utilising the benefits of falling crude prices to prevent a collapse of the market.\n\n",

India&rsquo;s oil demand grew by 300,000 barrels a day last year, double the average rate in the previous decade, according to a report by The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies this month. China&rsquo;s growth has slowed to 300,000 barrels from an average 500,000 barrels in the decade to 2013 as the government moves the economy away from heavy industry.\n Since the turn of the century, China has guzzled oil as its economy expanded, helping drive up crude prices to above $100 a barrel. A slowdown in this growth in the past few years and a surge in production from the US to Russia and Saudi Arabia sent prices crashing to below $30 a barrel, pummeling oil-producing nations&rsquo; economies.\n &ldquo;In this new era of slower Chinese growth, a new contender has emerged: India,&rdquo; Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects, and Anupama Sen, senior research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, wrote in the report.\n\n&ldquo;Structural and policy-driven changes are underway which could result in India&rsquo;s oil demand &lsquo;taking off &rsquo; in a similar way to China&rsquo;s during the late 1990s.&rdquo; As living standards improve, Indians are buying more cars and the government is looking to boost the share of manufacturing in the country&rsquo;s gross domestic product, which traditionally has been services-led.\n\n",

After the sale, the government will continue to hold a majority stake of 69.96 per cent in the firm.\n\nNTPC stake sale is part of the government's disinvestment programme through which it aims to raise Rs 69,500 crore in the fiscal year ending March 31.\n\n\"We will reassess the level of government support incorporated in the company's ratings only if the government's shareholding falls below 50 per cent or if there are other indicators of a change in the relationship between the government and NTPC,\" Tyagi said.\n\nMoody's, however, said NTPC's rating could come under downward pressure if there are unfavourable regulatory developments such as tariff reductions, which could negatively affect the company's financial position.\n\nFurthermore, a rating downgrade could result if the government reduces its interest in NTPC to below 50 per cent or any indication of weakening government support\n\n",

            "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Crude oil prices are unlikely to bounce back soon, but domestic fund managers hope for a quick turnaround in crude oil prices, as they feel they have a positive correlation with the equity market.\n\n&ldquo;In 2016, oil prices and the equity market will get positively correlated in India, which means if oil prices will go up, domestic equity market will go up too,&rdquo; S Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC, said at the ET Roundtable.\n\n&ldquo;In the near term, when oil prices go up, the requisite assets need not be sold and that will stop FII selling, leading to a rally in the equity market,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If crude prices were to go up from $38 to $60, that phase will be marked by improvement in asset prices all over the world,&rdquo; Naren said.\n\nFor minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets\n A fall in crude oil prices was considered good for the Indian market, because of the macroeconomic benefits that it could accrue besides reducing input cost burden for India Inc, leading to earnings expansion\n\nBut, despite falling crude oil prices, the Indian market could not really do much in 2015. In fact it has given negative returns so far in 2015. One of the reasons for the fall in the market across the globe, including India, was the fall in crude oil prices due to a supply glut, as well as uncertainty over the rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nCrude oil prices have declined more than 40 per cent so far in 2015 and about 15 per cent in the past one month alone. Come 2016, analysts are expecting a recovery in crude oil prices to support global growth as well as equity markets.\n Other analysts too say a fall in crude oil prices is not entirely good for equity markets across the world, and since India is not entirely decoupled, it will face the consequences. However, it may act as a boon for the economy as it still forms a major component of our import bill.\n\n&ldquo;What we missed out is one part of the global commodity meltdown, which was a gain in India due to a fall in crude oil prices. The other part is that when oil prices were high, the oil-producing countries invested a lot of assets across the world,&rdquo; Naren said.\n\n&ldquo;With the fall in oil prices, they were forced to sell some of their assets and that selloff led to lower returns in most markets across the world,&rdquo; he said.\n\nA lot of selling that happened across the world was due to redemption pressure on funds in key markets, especially in emerging markets. Oil exploration is a capital-extensive business, and most companies have invested heavily on that.\n None of the oil producers have blinked in terms of production cuts to support prices. Lifting of sanctions on Iran has further complicated matters for producers, as its supplies will now join the market, experts pointed out.\n\n&ldquo;The recently released projections by IMF are in line with our target of sub-$30 level for crude oil sometime in 2016. The lifting of the 40-year-old ban on oil exports by the US administration has also triggered a dip in prices,&rdquo; said Tarun Dang, Managing Partner, Trend-Wise Capital Management.\n\n&ldquo;This has led to the narrowing of the spread between WTI and Brent (the two globally dominant crude oil benchmarks) prices, with the latter dipping to move towards parity with the former,&rdquo; he said.\n\nCrude prices are trading below the breakeven point for most oil producers. This is going to discourage further exploration, and may even trigger writeoff of big loans.\n\nNaren said in most parts of the world, the economic recovery has been without any capital expenditure, but shale gas production in the US was one area which has been capital extensive.\n\n&ldquo;As you created a zero per cent return environment, people wanted to get returns. So they chose a category of high-yield funds but with the fall in oil price, that category did very badly in 2015. This combination led the markets down in 2015,&rdquo; he said.\n\nBrent crude touched $35.98 on Tuesday, its lowest since July 2004, after an unexpected fall in US crude inventories. It hovered around its 11-year low as supplies continued to exceed demand.\n\nAccording to a recent report by International Monetary Fund, crude oil prices could go down by another $5 to $15 a barrel from current level after a resurgence in Iranian oil exports next year.\n\nBut analysts say at current levels, crude oil has got a strong support, and in all probability, it should bounce back as the prices are close to the tipping point.\n\n&ldquo;I see a lot of volatility in crude prices for sure. At this moment, it is anybody&rsquo;s guess. But I would say there is still a lot of scope for oil prices to drift further lower, though I do not see $5-15 a barrel fall,&rdquo; said Vandana Hari, Editorial Director, Platts.\n\n\"I do feel that we are getting closer to the tipping point. Historically, $38 has been a strong support for crude prices. If you go even longer back in history, $30 should be the support level,&rdquo; she said.\n\n",

            "articleBody": "PARIS: India&rsquo;s ambitious renewable energy push, which include a seven-fold increase in generation capacity, is unlikely to help bridge the country&rsquo;s huge development deficit. Its development needs are real. It is not just the 400 million people without access to electricity and hundreds of million more who are underserved compared to global averages of electricity consumption, who present a challenge for the Indian government. The government has said that it intends to ensure that all households have electricity by 2022. This electricity for all drive apart, there will be a surge in demand for energy as India industrialises, builds infrastructure, and urbanises. Access to energy is central to this enterprise of achieving sustained economic growth and eradicating poverty.\n Foreclosing the option of using coal doesn&rsquo;t look like much of an option for India. &ldquo;Coal will continue to be the mainstay of India&rsquo;s energy basket. But we are prepared to look at options,&rdquo; says Environment Secretary Lavasa.\n India&rsquo;s top environment official is not obfuscating the issue when he says that India is open to options. New Delhi has proposed an ambitious ramp up of renewable energy capacity&mdash;from about 40GW to 175 GW in eight years. An ambition that translates in the climate plans submitted to the UN ahead of the Paris meet to ensuring that by 2030, 40% of the country&rsquo;s installed power generation capacity would be non-fossil fuels. New Delhi is working to put together an alliance of some 120-odd countries with high solar energy potential to make the large-scale use of solar energy economically viable.\n\nThese efforts are expected to reduce the share of coal in generation from its current level of 61% to 57% in 2031, while solar which at present accounts for 1% of the total will increase to 10%.\n\nPolicy makers and experts show wide divergences in projections on the surge in energy demand. They argue that is difficult to determine the range of this surge with any level of precision as India&rsquo;s needs are unpredictable. The government is looking at augmenting manufacturing on a large scale through the Make in India plank, increased urbanization and a push for setting up as many as 100 smart cities, and most of the country&rsquo;s infrastructure is yet to be built&mdash;all this makes India&rsquo;s energy requirements big but also unpredictable. India&rsquo;s current generation capacity is 230GW, this is projected to increase to 820-870GW by 2030.\n &ldquo;The big question for an economy like ours is: where will the electricity come from?&rdquo; asks environment secretary Ashok Lavasa. Drawing on the INDCs, senior fellow at the Delhi-based think tank Centre for Policy Research, Navroz Dubash says that India could add as much renewable energy as the entire size of its grid by 2030. &ldquo;But even this huge renewable energy addition would likely not substitute for a great deal more coal, because our overall needs are going to grow even more. This said, there are a lot of uncertainties about just how much energy we need in future.&rdquo;\n\nThe uncertainty of India&rsquo;s energy needs makes it difficult to quantify how much more coal would need to be used. Dubash says, &ldquo;much depends on whether we manage to radically restructure our economy to be more energy efficiency, which would be good from an energy security and air pollution point of view, and also bring about reduced greenhouse gas emissions.&rdquo; Experts agree that all efforts notwithstanding coal will remain the mainstay of the energy basket.\n\nSenior officials dealing with climate issues argue that across the world, for most part fossil fuels are the mainstay of energy systems. &ldquo;All established economies grew on fossil fuel. Now with climate change, we are attempting to do things differently. But in making choices, economies like India cannot lose sight of the overwhelming development deficit its people face,&rdquo; Lavasa explained.\n\nBut it is not just India. Benjamin Sporton, Chief Executive, World Coal Association points to the countries like the United States and Germany, where coal will continue to be a significant energy source. &ldquo;According to the US Environment Protection Agency, the share of coal in electricity in the US will be at 27% after 15 years of implementing the Clean Power Plan.\n\nToday, share of coal is between 33% and 35%. Coal is not going away.&rdquo; Indian negotiators stress they are not seeking the right to pollute, which is how continuing with the use of coal is being increasingly viewed. India&rsquo;s objection emanates out the real dilemma of balancing needs of development and ensuring rapid economic growth with addressing climate change and ensuring ecological sustainability. They argue that India is cognisant of the need to reduce emissions.\n\n\nThis correspondent is in Paris at the invitation of Climate Action Network South Asia, an NGO.\n\n",

With a similar population to China, you can only imagine the growth that will take place.\"\n\nHe said Modi government's vision, is to transform India from a USD 2 trillion economy to USD 20 trillion economy and he is confident that this vision can be made into a reality with a learning from the UK and with a strong and outstanding partnership.\n\nThe UK has come to recognise India is a country bringing meaningful opportunity and there is huge potential for collaboration across the sectors including health care, education, defence and manufacturing, he said.\n\n",

Two bodies were later found, it said. It gave no details on the cause of the blast.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency reported that the mine's owner was being questioned by police.\n China's mines are the world's deadliest. There has been a dramatic drop in accidental deaths in recent years, partly as a result of improved safety measures but also because of falling coal production levels as the slowing economy reduces demand. \n",
