        "articleBody": "Tata Motors on Wednesday said it is expecting policy continuity in the forthcoming Union Budget and also said that there is a need for more players in the charging infra space for faster adoption of electric mobility in the country. The new NDA government at the Centre is likely to present the Union Budget next month. The Central Government has been presenting the Union Budget on February 1 in recent years. However, in February this year, the government could only present an interim Budget due to 2024 being the election year.  So, as far as the budget expectation is concerned, the government has been very crystal clear and supportive of accelerated penetration of electric mobility in the country. We have the entire schemes such as GST and PLI, among others.  So what we would expect (in the Union Budget) is that the policy continues till this (electric vehicle) industry becomes self-sufficient,  Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Managing Director Shailesh Chandra told reporters here. It (the policy) should also continue till 15-20 per cent penetration level is reached in the electric vehicle space, he said, and added that there should be a stronger focus on policy support towards charging infrastructure, which is one of the   barriers  for electric vehicle penetration. He said that oil marketing companies have been given subsidies for installing 2000 chargers in the next 18 months or so, and emphasized that there can be more private participation in this space.  We need more and more players, more professionally managed to lead this journey. We should remove the bottlenecks which are there to install chargers from the community level or even to get access to connections from Discoms while installing a public charger,  Chandra added.",

        "articleBody": "A record $1.8 trillion pumped into clean energy in 2023 globally may still not be enough to meet the COP28 target of tripling renewables capacity by 2030, consulting firm EY said on Thursday. Besides building assets to generate clean energy, the other challenge faced by companies is getting their projects hooked up to the electric grid, which is struggling to integrate new wind, solar and battery power. WHY IT'S IMPORTANTGrowth in solar and wind power pushed renewable generation to a record 30% of global electricity production in 2023, up slightly from 29.4% in 2022. Most of the addition came from China, a country EY sees as one of the leaders in renewable energy development, alongside the U.S. and Germany. A report by the International Energy Agency earlier this month, however, showed that climate plans taken up by different countries, besides 14 of a total of 194 nations, are not yet in line to meet the target. Investors face higher capital costs due to a steep interest rate environment.  The sector should prepare for two or three years (at least) of more constrained financing and raised expectations from investors,  EY stated. Battery energy storage systems could play a vital role in a more volatile grid, the report says. The deployment is forecast to quadruple to 572 gigawatts (GW) or 1,848 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by 2030, much of which would be adopted at grid-scale, it adds.

        "articleBody": "India has been ranked 63rd on a global Energy Transition Index released on Wednesday by the World Economic Forum, which said the country has shown significant improvement across energy equity, security and sustainability. European nations dominated the top ranks with Sweden topping the index, followed by Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and France in the top five.  China was ranked 20th.  The improvement shown by India and some other developing countries such as China and Brazil assumes significance as 83 per cent of countries have moved backwards from last year in at least one of the three energy system performance dimensions -- security, equity and sustainability.  Taking note of various initiatives taken in India, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said the country is leading the way in creating outcomes that can be replicated elsewhere.  It said the governments can also consider creating awareness and policy interventions, such as guidelines for energy-efficient built infrastructure and incentives for retrofitting, to shape an enabling environment for accelerated adoption.   The developing world has an opportunity to rewrite the rules and show the way to successfully transform energy demand -- an example of reverse innovation is frugal, scalable innovation originating in developed countries and then scaled across the world,  it added.  On the role of China and India, the WEF said that with roughly a third of the global population, these two countries will play a critical role.   Both have experienced progress in renewable energy buildout, energy access improvements and energy security. However, the phase-down trajectory of coal will be a major driver of emissions. Additionally, these countries are in a strong position for green tech manufacturing,  the WEF said.  Globally, the report said the energy transition to a more equitable, secure and sustainable energy system is still progressing but has lost momentum in the face of increasing uncertainty worldwide.  While 107 of the 120 countries benchmarked in the report demonstrated progress on their energy transition journeys in the past decade, the overall pace of the transition has slowed and balancing its different facets remains a key challenge.   While innovation growth has slowed, countries like China and India are leading in developing new energy solutions and technologies,  it added.  The WEF also lauded the strides made by India in its clean energy infrastructure, with renewable energy and biomass comprising 42 per cent of its power generation capacity, making it the fourth-largest renewables market globally.  With annual investments nearing USD 10 billion, India is driving the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the production of green hydrogen.   However, the significant dependence on coal in both China and India continues to be a major factor in their emission intensity,  it said.  Emerging and developing Asia, including populous nations like India and China, showed an 8 per cent improvement in ETI scores over the past decade, mainly in reducing energy intensity.  The WEF also noted India's focus on leveraging energy for income generation and supporting microenterprises through the productive use of renewable energy sources.   There is also a strong emphasis on ensuring the affordability and economic viability of these solutions, underscoring India's commitment to promoting sustainable energy practices that benefit local communities and drive economic growth,  it added.  India's per capita emissions, at 1.7 tonnes of CO2, are already 60 per cent lower than the global average of 4.4 tonnes of CO2 per capita.   However, there is still a need to decouple growth from energy demand. This requires significant investment in energy efficiency, particularly during the development of new infrastructure and manufacturing capacity,  it said while noting that India has been taking multiple initiatives in this regard.",

According to CRISIL Ratings, the key growth driver for renewables is demand for sustainable energy transition. \u201cThe government\u2019s target is driving up auctions, which has created a strong pipeline. India saw auctions of 35 GW in fiscal 2024, the highest ever in a single fiscal, resulting in a strong pipeline of 75 GW. This will primarily drive implementation of 50 GW capacity over the next two fiscals,\u201d it said.Further, the need for improved physical connectivity in the roads sector has led to healthy awarding over the past few fiscal years, barring the last one. \u201cStrengthened order books of road developers, at 2.5 times of revenue, will support 11% growth in highway construction, which is seen at 12,500 km per year over the next two fiscals,\u201d it added.CRISIL Ratings said the real estate sector is expected to see 8-10% jump in demand for commercial office space this fiscal and the next while demand for residential real estate will sustain at 8-12% this fiscal and the next, aided by favourable affordability.\u201cThe primary drivers of the same will be global capability centres eyeing India\u2019s large talent pool and competitive rentals, as well as healthy demand from domestic sectors,\u201d it added.As per the CRISIL Ratings, cumulatively over Rs 2 lakh crore of equity capital has been deployed in these sectors over the past two fiscals driven by strong investor participation.\u201cA key enabler here has been the emergence of vehicles such as infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The capital inflows from investors have helped improve credit profiles of private players, thus strengthening their ability to fund future growth,\u201d it added.However, there are some risks to watch out for as the growth momentum could be impacted if these play out in a meaningful way, it said.\u201cIn renewables, timely commissioning of storage and storage-linked capacities remains a key risk given their higher tariffs compared with the usual renewable capacities,\u201d it said.Similarly, the moderation in government budgetary allocation to the roads sector could be a risk. \u201cAmendments in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) toll model concession agreement have been made to increase private participation. However, improvement in traffic estimation accuracy and increase in willingness of lenders to fund BOT toll projects will bear watching,\u201d it cautioned. \u201cIn real estate, while reduction in inventory in recent years has added to the resilience of the sector, discipline in new launches and, consequently, the impact on inventory going ahead will remain monitorable,\u201d it added.",

ReNew Power got the highest award with a nod to construct 600 megawatts or half the total capacity on offer through the tender. The remainder of the tender is split between the two other players.As part of the project, it is compulsory to install an energy storage system with a minimum capacity of 100 megawatt hour for every 100 megawatt of project capacity.As per the agreement the developer must supply energy corresponding to a maximum of 4,000 kilowatt hours per megawatt of the contracted capacity daily during the cumulative number of peak hours as per the schedule provided by the buying entity.While the power purchase agreement for sale of the power by ACME will be signed with SECI, the agency could enter back-to-back agreements with other offtakers such as state-owned power distribution companies.The projects have to be connected to the inter-state transmission system through which the power will be evacuated from the production site.Gurugram-based ACME Group, founded by Manoj Upadhyay, has a large portfolio of solar power projects with almost 10 gigawatts of such projects under construction as per its website. The website also states that the company has 1.5 gigawatts of operational solar power projects.",

        "articleBody": "The imperative of circular bioeconomy for driving sustainable consumption and production found special attention under the Environment, Climate and Sustainability Working Group (ECSWG) in India\u2019s G20 presidency. The circular bioeconomy presents a promising strategy for producing bioenergy and biomaterials, offering a sustainable solution that addresses the interconnected challenges of energy and the environment. Current challenges and opportunities in India's Bioenergy landscapeThe G20 nations currently account for over 70% of global energy consumption. However, share of energy generated from waste (including biobased feedstocks) contribute to a meagre 7% of the total final energy consumption. Considering the imminent threat arising from climate change there is an urgent need to accelerate sustainable sources like biomass to meet the growing demand for energy and materials. India\u2019s share of bioenergy in total energy mix is higher than that of other G20 countries, however majority of the usage happens in a very inefficient manner. There is significant reliance on dried cow dung, straw or stubbles and woody biomass obtained from non-forest land or post-consumer wood waste. As per an assessment by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India is estimated to generate 774 million tonnes of biomass from agricultural fields, out which nearly 230 million tonnes have been estimated to be surplus. These are often left unattended or burnt in fields leading to significant local air pollution in the form of particulate matter causing damages to human health. As per MNRE, India has a total livestock population of 536 million, out of which around 300 million consists of bovines (including cattle, buffalo, yak, etc). With an average dung of 5 kg per animal, the average dung generation is estimated at 540 million tonnes per annum. Unattended manure is a major source of methane emission which has significant global warming potential. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), annually adult cattle can emit 1 kg of methane although these values may be highly variable as it depends a lot on the ambient weather condition and tend vary over seasons and across geographies. Market mechanisms for driving sustainable practices: The Green Credit ProgramMarket based incentive mechanism are often advocated as drivers of productive utilization of bio-based residues that can help mitigate air pollution while creating opportunities of augmenting sustainable materials. For example, economic utilization of agri-residue can prevent release of particulates from open burning thereby prevention of air pollution borne disease and enhancing quality of life, while the use of digestates from biogas plants in agriculture that contributes to improved soil structure, improved water infiltration and greater water-holding capacity, better nutrients retention of plants etc. Just as carbon markets played a crucial role in driving emission reductions and offering cost-effective solutions to mitigate climate change, similar instruments can also help in catalysing adoption of sustainable practices that can go beyond carbon markets.The good news is that a market mechanism in the form of Green Credit was announced by India in 2023, with an objective to reward and incentivize entities for positive environmental contributions beyond carbon through the price discovery of various environmental goods and services. Green Credit program encompasses eight key types of activities including tree plantation, water management, sustainable agriculture, waste management, air pollution reduction, etc. Green credit programme however is completely voluntary and there is no demand for green credit in the domestic market as of now. While the methodology for the forestry sector have been developed and currently at a pilot phase, there had not been much discussion on developing robust methodologies for tapping opportunities in sectors related to agriculture, transport, waste management, air pollution reduction. Developing robust methodologies for sectoral integrationThe imperative of accelerating circular bioeconomy and energy transition warrants urgent attention for drawing a robust methodology that can help capture these benefits. The benefit of utilization of biomass residues for biogas production on these environmental goods and services, based on the circular bioeconomy principles, can be best understood through available and established scientific studies. Careful examination of scientific findings will help in setting benchmarks and further creating opportunities for fungibility. The aspect of fungibility becomes extremely crucial when interventions like biogas has positive repel effect on other sectors including agriculture, transport, and residential sector. An investment in biogas project not only helps in avoided emission, but also helps in generation of other benefits including production of bioproducts. These products will provide differential benefits across various sectors. The larger questions that need considerable deliberations are how a developer can reap the cross sectoral benefits, the way it is to be harmonized across sectors, and how the benefits can be distributed across various beneficiaries. Another issue of particularly relevance will be the potential variability of benefits that are contingent to ambient conditions and benchmarking them. For example, the benefit of applying a quantity of digestate, a byproduct of a biogas plant, across different soils may vary significantly. The imperative of a robust third-party monitoring and review framework becomes extremely crucial for the overall success. This warrants a considerable consultation with the scientific community and practitioners for arriving at a consensus on acceptable estimates of benefits and sharing.Fostering collaboration for technological advancements and financial supportWhile Green Credit offers potential benefits, it's not a cure-all for advancing the circular bioeconomy. Success in this endeavour hinges on several factors, including technological advancements and financial support. Collaboration between industry and academia, spanning geographical boundaries, is crucial for scaling up research and development efforts, particularly focusing on enhancing productivity and product quality. Establishing uniform incentive structures is essential to attract investments and promote sustainable products in the market.Addressing the diverse stakeholders involved requires coordinated efforts across government agencies spanning various sectors such as trade, finance, environment, science and technology, agriculture, transport, and energy. Given the complexity of the challenges across sectors, a central agency is needed to lead and maintain balance in the process. A concerted push in this direction, supported by robust engagement and discussions on the identified issues, will create numerous opportunities for stakeholders while aiding their journey towards sustainability.(The author is Associate Director, Resource Efficiency & Governance, TERI)",

The AMC's goal is to make EV charging stations a necessary feature in the blueprints for all new constructions.Meanwhile, the corporation has issued tenders for 81 new charging points across the city which would be located in strategic locations such as Kankaria Kids City, Navrangpura Multilevel Parking, and under flyovers. Currently, there are over 15 charging stations on AMC-owned premises. We are stepping up our efforts to promote electric vehicles (EVs) in the city. Our plans include facilitating private entities to establish charging facilities at 81 locations across Ahmedabad,  a senior AMC official told TOI.AMC is also planning to convert its entire vehicle fleet to EVs, including providing e-cars to its officials. This highlights their strong commitment to an all-electric transportation system.To boost the adoption of EV infrastructure, the AMC is offering incentives for installing charging stations in common areas of older residential societies and providing a complete exemption on vehicle tax for newly purchased electric vehicles.This initiative is aligned with the Gujarat Electric Policy 2021, which offers subsidies ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 1.50 lakh for electric vehicles and their charging stations.An amendment to the Comprehensive General Development Control Regulations (CGDCR) to mandate EV charging stations in new buildings is currently under review.This strategy ensures that residential societies undergoing redevelopment will be equipped with EV charging infrastructure, promoting a sustainable future.Efforts are also underway to expand the public e-charging network and foster partnerships with private entities to enhance the accessibility of EV charging facilities.In a related development, ITC Sonar and ITC Royal Bengal inaugurated a state-of-the-art EV charging station on World Environment Day. The station includes both AC and DC chargers and can accommodate up to three vehicles simultaneously.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his third term with a weakened mandate, wants India to embrace a new \u201cgreen era\u201d at the forefront of climate diplomacy and clean technology.To succeed, he\u2019ll need to balance those ambitions against a need to sustain growth and satisfy rapidly accelerating electricity demand, leaning on a fraying power system still heavily dependent on coal.Modi, who has cast himself as climate champion for much of the past decade, will be under pressure to make faster progress toward existing green targets, including pledges to hit net zero by 2070, install a mammoth 500 gigawatts of non-fossil energy by the end of the decade, and corral a global alliance on solar power that aims to secure $1 trillion in investment.But significant expansion in clean energy \u2014 India added over 100 GW of renewable capacity during past 10 years of Modi\u2019s government \u2014 has not been enough to satisfy steep demand growth and the limitations of the country\u2019s transmission and distribution networks.With energy security a priority, coal still accounts for roughly three-quarters of output today and its use continues to rise. India plans to add close to 90 GW of coal projects by 2032 \u2014 about 63% more than the existing blueprint, published in May 2023.New Delhi has expanded coal mining to a record, extended the lives of power plants and pressed for the softening of language around fossil fuels at international climate talks. State miner Coal India Ltd., which until the pandemic was planning to diversify into solar power, is now prioritizing the spending of record sums to expand fossil fuel output.This is unlikely to ease under a new government.According to Ashwini Swain, fellow at New Delhi-based research organization Sustainable Futures Collaborative, a more fragile and fractious coalition could be prompted to push for projects that spread largesse and earn political support. \u201cProtecting the fossil ecosystem may seem to be aligned with the objective,\u201d he said.Of course, India\u2019s green ambition is real and the country, among the most climate-vulnerable globally, has been experiencing more frequent instances of extreme heat and drought. A pro-poor, pro-growth agenda does not need to rely on coal, which has shown itself to be costlier and less reliable than cleaner alternatives, said independent power analyst Alexander Hogeveen Rutter, who is based in Bengaluru. \u201cThere is a real opportunity for the new government to radically rethink its strategy by doubling down on renewable energy and storage rather than on investments in new, uneconomic and unreliable coal plants,\u201d he said.But the investment requirements are steep, especially when it comes to infrastructure changes that will underpin a transition, from overhauling mobility in sprawling cities to power networks. In 2022, India\u2019s electricity planners calculated that in order to reach India\u2019s renewable goals, the cost of laying new cables alone would be around 2.4 trillion rupees ($29 billion). Renewable projects are still often built in barren areas, far from demand centers in cities and industrial hubs, where the power is consumed. Meanwhile, the fragile financial health of distribution companies connecting homes or factories regularly deprive them of reliable supplies. A 3-trillion rupee project led by the power ministry will go some way to fixing profitability, thanks to initiatives like smart metering, but progress is slow.One potential change for the next five years will be the role of local parties, which may ease centralization and bring regional interests up the agenda, climate analysts and researchers said \u2014 and that includes spreading green manufacturing and clean energy benefits.\u201cA coalition government should allow more states to make claims on the growing green economy in India,\u201d said Rohit Chandra, assistant professor at the IIT Delhi School of Public Policy. \u201cThe last decade saw most of this activity in four or five states, including Gujarat and Rajasthan.\u201dThose two states \u2014 also bastions of support for Modi\u2019s party \u2014 do enjoy the lowest cost of energy generation, but poorer regions will now have a greater political role, potentially pulling investments to less affluent areas.\u201cIf we see more decentralization and more state-led growth, you could see some of these transition policies being intertwined with bread and butter economic aspirations, including health and education,\u201d said Shayak Sengupta, energy and climate fellow with the Climate at Observer Research Foundation America.",

India did not formally sign these agreements as domestic approval processes are still underway and will be completed after the formation of the new government,  the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement. Talks for these pacts concluded in November last year. The process of government formation is on at present in India as the Lok Sabha elections got over this week. In November last year, the IPEF declared a substantial conclusion of negotiations for a Clean Economy, Fair Economy, and the overarching agreement on the IPEF for Prosperity post which the member countries completed a legal review of the text for these agreements and domestic approval processes. These agreements will enter into force after at least five IPEF partners complete their internal legal procedures for ratification, acceptance or approval.  Today, IPEF members signed these agreements which are first-of-their-kind approaches to addressing 21st-century challenges and strengthening economic engagement across a critical region. India actively participated in the signing proceedings and the ministerial deliberations,  it said. ",

        "description": "Azerbaijan, the host of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 29), is aiming to shield the annual talks from geopolitical tensions by proposing a two-week COP truce. This initiative, inspired by the Olympic truce, is intended to unite countries in a collaborative effort to address the pressing issue of climate change. Hikmet Hajiyev, foreign policy adviser to Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, highlighted the current global geopolitical polarization as reminiscent of the Cold War era, making consensus-building on climate action challenging.",

        "articleBody": "Baku (Azerbaijan): Azerbaijan, the host of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 29), has set a lofty goal of ring-fencing the annual talks from geopolitical strife.The incoming presidency is proposing a two-week moratorium, COP truce, modelled on the Olympic truce, to bring all countries together to work in the spirit of cooperation and collaboration to tackle the existential crisis that is climate change. According to Hikmet Hajiyev, foreign policy adviser to Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, the geopolitical polarisation that the world is seeing is a throwback to the Cold War era. In a way, it is a worse manifestation of the Cold War conundrum,  Hajiyev told visiting journalists on Wednesday.  Unfortunately, the world is divided by recent developments, and under these circumstances reaching the goal through consensus is very difficult.  110775930The Azerbaijani view of the climate issue is that it is  the wizard on the political and geopolitical issues , and while countries could be on opposing sides of issues, climate change is an issue that puts every country on the same side, because it affects everybody, everywhere in the world. No one is immune, it affects everybody, everywhere, therefore, we need an inclusive process that builds a unanimous global approach on the issue,  the senior Azerbaijani official said. The COP truce is one way of leaving the geopolitical polarisation at the door to focus on working together in a common endeavour.  It's like the Olympics truce. So, during the period of the COP, all cannons should stop, and we should work on the climate issue. Not because of us, but because of our children and grandchildren,  said Hajiyev.Hajiyev appeared not to rule out the inclusion of the idea in the negotiated agreement at Baku.working to build coalition What is clear from the foreign adviser's emphasis is that the idea of a COP truce will be an important element of the COP29 presidency's Action Agenda. The idea is to get a buy-in to the idea from a sizable number of countries. The Azerbaijan team is already working on building a coalition around the idea, and is talking to different countries and the United Nations.  We have had positive reactions. I think there will be a lot of like-minded countries that will support it. It will be an open-ended process allowing countries to join in at different points,  said Hajiyev.What gives the Azerbaijani official the confidence that it will be able to pull off the truce is the experience of striking a peace deal with its neighbour Armenia. The Action Agenda refers to a set of priorities and sectors that the host identifies to mobilise action by bringing together non-party stakeholders, such as businesses, academia, intergovernmental agencies, and state and local government representatives.The Action Agenda is aimed at encouraging efforts to tackle climate change, as well as giving a signal to negotiators on the extent of the willingness and commitment of different stakeholders to take on measures to deal with climate change. Another item on the presidency's list is a global stock take of the declarations and pledges made under the Action Agenda. Last year, countries completed the first global stock take under the Paris Agreement, which included an evaluation of all the climate commitments made by countries in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs). It also included measures that countries agreed to take and incorporate in their next round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Assessment of Action AgendaAzerbaijan is proposing undertaking a somewhat similar assessment of the Action Agenda.  This is taking the stock-taking approach, streamlining everything to see what has been achieved and what has not,  said Hajiyev.  We will also work with the countries that initiated declarations and initiatives to establish what are the next steps under these declarations and initiatives, determine the measure of success, identify where the emphasis needs to be, or what adjustments need to be made. He cautioned that this is an idea still under development and that it is  a little too early to say  if the stock take would culminate in a report. Agenda Being finalisedThe COP29 presidency is still in the process of finalising its agenda.  As you know, it was only in December that it was agreed that Azerbaijan would host COP29,  said Hajiyev. Unlike most countries that host the annual UN climate talks, Azerbaijan has less than a year to prepare for the November meeting. The host country rotates among the five United Nations regional groups (Africa, Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin American and the Caribbean, and Western European and Others).Within the regional group, the decision on the host is taken by the member countries of the designated region. The 2024 meet, or COP29, was designated to be held in Eastern Europe. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made a consensus decision on the COP29 host virtually impossible, with Russia blocking offers by EU member states putting Bulgaria out of reckoning. Offers by traditional Russian allies, Serbia and Moldova, too were blocked by Russia, as the two countries moved into closer partnership with the EU.

Among many initiatives of Delhi government, mohalla bus service scheme and the second edition of the policies on electric vehicles and solar power are awaiting approval. Additionally, road development work at 341 locations under the Dilli Gramoday Abhiyan, redevelopment of New Delhi Municipal Council's Shivaji Stadium bus terminal, repair work at Kamla Market opposite New Delhi Railway Station and the opening of a 3km cycle track in Nehru Park are among work that is pending. Solar Policy, EVs on priority listArvind Kejriwal- led Delhi government had announced the Delhi Solar Policy, 2023, that aims to help consumers with monthly electricity usage exceeding 400 units to achieve zero bills through the installation of rooftop solar plants. The government is expected to soon launch a portal to assist interested individuals in installing rooftop panels on their homes, reported ToI quoting an official.   110767355 Addtionally, government is also expected to expedite work on a revised policy to promote electric vehicles, which will include attractive subsidy features.The Delhi government has completed talks with two companies to operate app-based premium buses equipped with air conditioning, reclining seats and WiFi.  The state govt was waiting for the elections to be over to roll out the scheme and now the right time has come,  said the official.Repair and maintaince on cards of Delhi government:Once the election code is lifted, the Public Works Department (PWD) plans to prioritise projects such as flyover maintenance, starting with the one at Sarita Vihar before moving on to others. Minor projects like maintenance of buildings and waterproofing of courts and hospitals are also pending, ToI's reported added further. Earlier this year, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi proposed various projects to the Delhi Development Authority regarding roads, drainage systems and streetlights in villages under the Dilli Gramoday Abhiyan. The majority of these works were recommended in villages in Najafgarh and Narela and in the south and west zones.According to PWD officials, they will follow up with the traffic police to obtain approval for the Sarita Vihar flyover repair work, and once this is acquired, will begin the work of replacing the extension joints.  DDA has sanctioned 349 projects costing Rs 407.1 crore and, till March 11, tenders had been floated for 344 of them,\u201d an MCD official revealed to ToI. \u201cAfter that, due to MCC imposition, the process for inviting agencies to implement the projects was put on hold except for eight of them. Now that the elections are over, we hope to speed up the work in the villages,  the official added. Revamp of the decades-old Kamla Market is also on the list, including painting the 73-year-old clock tower and the entrance of the complex.  In March, we approved the project to restore and revamp the market to its original glory. While some basic work was initiated, restoration of the fa\u00e7ade and parking area can begin only once MCC is lifted,  said an official.The maintenance of Mandi Road and the decongestion of the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road is also expected to gain momentum and, in addition, PWD will now resume work on the pending proposal for land acquisition.

        "articleBody": "India will have to invest as much as $385 billion to meet its target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030, but coal will remain a key source of electricity generation for the next decade, Moody's Ratings said on Thursday. India, a major greenhouse gas emitter, has said it aims to ramp up non-fossil fuel capacity set by 50 GW each year to help meet its 500 GW target. It missed its target of 175 GW by 2022. Moody's, however, estimates an annual capacity addition of around 44 GW will help achieve that target. For that, India will have to spend $190 billion to $215 billion on capacity over the next six to seven years and another $150 billion to $170 billion for transmission and distribution, the credit ratings agency estimates.  The sizable pipelines of announced projects will likely keep financial leverage of rated renewable power companies high over the next two to three years, a credit negative, but leverage of government related issuers is likely to remain moderate over the same period,  Moody's said. India's strong policy support has boosted the renewable energy share to around 43% in its power capacity mix in fiscal 2023-24, attracting private sector investments. Adani Group, through Adani Green Energy, aims to generate 45 GW of renewable power by 2030 as it strives to become the country's first integrated renewable energy player. Continued policy backing will facilitate significant progress toward India's 2030 transition and 2070 net-zero targets, said Moody's. However, despite the steady growth in renewable energy, most of which will likely be solar power, Moody's expects coal will play a significant role in electricity generation for the next eight to ten years.  We expect India to add 40GW-50GW of coal-based capacity over the next five to six years to help meet power demand, which is likely to grow by 5%-6% annually over this period. ",

We are witnessing a positive trend in the renewable sector's workforce. The renewable energy sector is more than just about green energy, it is about fostering a resilient and engaged workforce passionate about making a difference. The decline in attrition rates is a testament to the fact that employees are not only finding meaningful careers but are also deeply engaged and motivated by their impactful work,  TeamLease Services CSO Staffing Subburathinam P said. The insights of the report are based on internal data analysis of renewable energy companies that TeamLease Services works with. The data further found that attrition rate has decreased to 33.5 per cent in FY24, compared to 38.8 per cent in 2022-23.

        "articleBody": "The third edition of the Modi government's flagship electric vehicle incentive scheme FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) with an outlay of about Rs 10,000 crore is likely to be rolled out within the first 100 days of the new government taking charge next month, a senior official said.The scheme will offer financial incentives to electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers as well as government-owned buses, the official told ET.However, a final decision on whether to include electric cars, including for institutional buyers such as taxi aggregators, in the FAME 3 scheme is yet to be taken, the official added.  110508375\u201cThe proposed scheme mirrors the FAME 2 which lapsed in March 2024. It will be sent for approval to the Union cabinet shortly after the new government takes charge in June,\u201d the official said. FAME 2 had offered a 15% subsidy on the sale price of electric scooters sold in the country.FAME 3 will take forward the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS), which was introduced when FAME 2 ended on March 31, as a temporary plan till the general elections were over. With a total allocation of Rs 500 crore, EMPS is aimed at supporting sales of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers for four months till July.The FAME scheme was launched to encourage local manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles by extending demand incentives to end customers.\u201cSince it (FAME-3) will be a new scheme, all companies seeking incentives on sale of electric vehicles would have to apply for fresh certification,  the official said.According to the proposal being considered, FAME 3 is initially expected to be valid for sales made over a two-year period instead of five years under FAME 2.The government had incentivised purchase of 7,000 electric buses under FAME 2. The new scheme is likely to increase the number of electric buses subsidised for purchase by State Transport Undertakings (STUs).FAME 3, however, is likely to keep out of its scope subsidies for electric cars, even for commercial operations. Deliberations are underway on whether electric cars need any subsidy in the country,  the official cited above said, adding the current proposal for FAME 3 suggests offering incentives for electric cars priced at less than Rs 15 lakh, similar to FAME 2.Hybrid cars may also get support under FAME 3, subject to adhering to the price cap, if passenger cars are included in the scheme. \u201cThe government is also bringing in fresh guidelines in the new scheme and companies seeking to avail benefits would have to seek re-certification,  a second official said. Under EMPS, the government extends incentives of up to Rs 10,000 per electric two-wheeler (down from Rs 22,500 in FAME 2), and up to Rs 50,000 per electric three-wheeler (down from Rs 111,505). Both categories get incentives of Rs 5,000 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). EMPS is aimed at supporting sales of 372,215 EVs including electric two-wheelers (3,33,387) and three-wheelers (38,828). To encourage adoption of latest technologies, incentive benefits are being given to only vehicles fitted with advanced batteries. ",

Maybe this year we have to have an FPO. Our requirement is in this fiscal,  Das said. However, since the FPO will need government approval and to avoid long holiday months, it might materialise in the first half of 2025-26, he said.Separately, in March, the lender's board had approved a proposal of Rs 24,200-crore borrowing for 2024-25. The amount will be raised through taxable bonds, green taxable bonds, perpetual debt instruments, green masala bonds, green foreign currency bonds and external commercial borrowings, among others.Das emphasised the need for a defined green taxonomy in the country which could encourage interest in green bonds, and for corporate governance culture to be encouraged for it to be accounted for while lending and borrowing.GIFT IFSCThe lender plans to start operations through its subsidiary IREDA Global Green Energy Finance IFSC Ltd in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City, Gujarat this fiscal.  Initially, we are going to largely focus on our existing customers with whom we have a two to two and a half decades of mature banking relationship,  Das said.GIFT City operations would initially involve mostly solar modules manufacturing projects and green hydrogen and its derivatives. Green hydrogen and its derivatives have a tremendous potential for exports, he said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Ministry of Heavy Industries will hold a second round of meeting with stakeholders in a  month or two  to issue draft guidelines for the new electric vehicle (EV) policy that has been framed to attract global automakers like Tesla to set up manufacturing operations in India, a senior official said on Monday. Automakers wishing to avail of incentives under the policy will have to invest afresh as per the new norms, and old investments will not be considered, the official said.  This has been told to Vietnam's electric carmaker Vinfast, which in February this year had said it would invest USD 500 million (Rs 4,000 crore) in Tamil Nadu over a period of five years, according to the official.  In a significant move aimed at revolutionising the EV landscape in India, the government approved the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI) on March 15, 2024.  The first stakeholders' meeting was held in April in which an advisor representing Tesla -- The Asia Group (TAG) -- had also attended.   We have got a lot of representations. We have studied them so maybe in a month or two we may have the second consultative meeting. The task before us is to issue guidelines,  the official explained.  Stating that the government wants to issue them through a consultative process, the official said,  We will make the draft guidelines and will circulate those amongst the possible applicants and again call a consultative meeting.   Asked whether Tesla will be invited for the second consultative meeting, he said,  We will invite everyone, whoever wants to come is welcome .  He said eligible firms under the SPMEPCI can import at a reduced duty, provided they invest USD 500 million in greenfield investment.   On March 15, the scheme was notified and it was written that within 120 days or more the government will open the window and publish its guidelines.   Therefore, on July 31 or later when the window will be opened it will remain open for 120 days or more. During the window opening period, companies can apply. So, companies will apply and we will evaluate their applications,  a senior official said.  The official said Vinfast asked whether their old investments will count and the government has said it would not be counted.   They said they will stop more investments in that case until the scheme comes out. We said okay,  the official said, adding that there are no commitments and only the actual investment will be counted under the scheme.  He explained that it is a five-year scheme so the window can be opened again in the future.  Under the policy, the official said when the automobile manufacturers apply for the scheme, the government will give them an eligibility certificate.   Whatever is written in PLI auto scheme criteria will be followed in the scheme. Investment means establishment of plant and machinery, establishing charging infrastructure and assets,  the official said.  He clarified that the assets need not be within the premises of the company's plant but they should be owned by the company.  The official further said royalty will not qualify as investment under the scheme.   Royalty on import of technology will not qualify as part of investment. So, Bosch had an issue with that,  the official said, on discussions during the first consultations.  As per the new policy, companies that would set up manufacturing facilities for EV passenger cars with a minimum investment of Rs 4,150 crore (USD 500 million) in India will be allowed to import a limited number of cars at lower customs/import duty of 15 per cent on vehicles costing USD 35,000 and above for five years from the date of issuance of the approval letter by the government.  The manufacturing facilities will have to be made operational within three years from the date of issuance of approval letter by the Ministry of Heavy Industries and achieve minimum domestic value addition (DVA) of 25 per cent within the same period and a minimum DVA of 50 per cent within five years from the date of issuance of the approval letter by MHI.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Earth observation data can generate over USD 3 trillion in economic benefits globally and help eliminate two gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2030, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum. Earth observation data refers to the collection, analysis, and presentation of information about the Earth's physical, chemical, and biological systems using remote sensing technologies.  The report, created in partnership with Deloitte and endorsed by industry and climate leaders, emphasised that EO data is a crucial tool for economic growth and sustainability.  While certain sectors like agriculture, energy, and finance are expected to benefit the most from EO data, nearly all industries can gain insights to improve operations and reduce environmental impact.  For example, farmers can use EO data to enhance crop yield and sustainability practices, while insurance companies can better understand and mitigate environmental risks.  The report predicted that the global value of EO data could grow from USD 266 billion at present to over USD 700 billion by 2030. This could lead to a cumulative USD 3.8 trillion contribution to global GDP and help eliminate 2 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually - equivalent to the estimated combined annual emissions of 476 million gasoline-powered cars.  The Asia Pacific region is poised to capture the largest share of EO's value by 2030, reaching a potential value of USD 315 billion, while Africa and South America are positioned to realise the largest percentage growth.  However, challenges such as limited awareness, talent shortage, and fragmented standards hinder the widespread adoption of EO data. To fully realise its potential, collaborative efforts and informed policies are needed to stimulate demand, advance technology, and establish key standards, the report said.   Earth observation is a vital component of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,  said Jeremy Jurgens, Managing Director and Head of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution at the World Economic Forum.  It converges with artificial intelligence, digital twins and climate technology to offer a powerful toolset for economic prosperity and sustainable growth.    Earth data can play an instrumental role in helping organizations understand their impacts and dependencies on nature, comply with sustainability regulations and shape strategies that contribute to a nature-positive and net-zero economy,  said Jennifer Steinmann, Deloitte Global Sustainability leader.",

        "articleBody": "G7 environment ministers committed on Tuesday to ramp up the production and deployment of battery storage technology, an essential component for increasing renewable energy and combating climate change.Here is how and why batteries play a vital role in the energy transition: Growing demand Batteries have been central to the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) but are also critical to wind and solar power because of the intermittent nature of these energy sources.Surplus electricity must be stored in batteries to stabilise distribution regardless of peaks in demand, or breaks in supply at night or during low winds. Battery deployment in the energy sector last year increased more than 130 percent from 2022, according to a report released last week by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The main markets are China, the European Union and the United States. Following closely are Britain, South Korea, Japan and developing nations in Africa, where solar and storage technology is seen as the gateway to energy access.Six-fold goal To triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030 -- a goal set at the UN climate conference in December -- the IEA says a six-fold increase in battery storage will be necessary.Clean energy is essential to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and to hope to keep the international target of restricting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The total storage capacity required to achieve this target is an estimated 1,500 gigawatts by 2030.Of this, 1,200 GW will need to be supplied by batteries.Cost challenges In less than 15 years, the cost of batteries has fallen by 90 percent. The combination of solar PV and batteries is today competitive with new coal plants in India. And just in the next few years, it will be cheaper than new coal in China and gas-fired power in the United States,  IEA chief Fatih Birol said last week.  But still the pace is not fast enough to reach our goals in terms of climate change and energy security. Costs will have to come down further, he said, while calling for supply chains to be diversified. Most batteries are currently produced by China. But some 40 percent of planned battery manufacturing projects are in the United States and Europe, according to the IEA. If those projects are realised, they would be nearly sufficient to meet the needs of those countries.Metal matters Another thorny issue is the availability of critical metals like lithium and cobalt that are essential to make batteries.Experts say the development chemical alternatives could complement the dominant lithium-ion technology. Transition in the technology will reduce the amount of lithium  needed, said Brent Wanner, head of the IEA's power sector unit, adding,  this includes shifting to sodium-ion batteries . Beyond 2030, high-density solid-state batteries that offer a longer lifespan are expected to become commercially available. There are other storage options, although not as widely applicable or available as batteries.Pumped storage hydropower has long been used in the hydroelectric sector.The transformation of electricity into hydrogen, which can be stored and transported, is a new technology expected to become more readily available. Be flexible Renewable energy is not entirely reliant on storage and measures can be taken to improve the flexibility of its production to meet demands. Industry and governments are gearing up for the transition. The European Union's Energy Regulators Agency called on member states in September to asses their  flexibility potential  based on estimates that renewables will need to double by 2030. Such a rise requires greater  flexibility  in grids, meaning energy can be stored and distributed consistently despite fluctuating production and demand. The G7 said Tuesday it would not only support more production and use of battery storage, but promote technological advancements in the sector as well as grid infrastructure.",

        "articleBody": "Majority of occupiers in India prefer at least half of their office portfolio to be powered by renewable sources by 2030 to align with broader net zero carbon (NZC) goals, according to a JLL study. Around 43% of these occupiers are based in Delhi, followed by 27% in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai at 17% and 13%, respectively.Banking and finance sectors are the most likely to demand on-site renewable power sources for green spaces, followed by the construction, manufacturing, and consultancy industries, showed the study.Around 33% occupiers believe that on-site renewable energy will become non-negotiable for their organizations by 2030. Furthermore, 87% expect more than half of their energy needs to be met by renewables. Respondents also recognize that there exists a significant demand-supply gap for sustainable buildings, with demand projected to surpass supply.\u201cInvestors and occupiers are increasingly recognizing the importance of prioritizing green energy sources in their office portfolios, emphasizing the need for a well-crafted and thoughtful renewable energy strategy,\u201d said Radha Dhir, CEO & Country Head, India, JLL.She believes the real estate sector has a good opportunity to become a key player in the electricity infrastructure and shape the future of renewable energy, thereby advancing aspirations for a greener and more sustainable future.The Asia Pacific (APAC) region, particularly countries like Australia, China, Vietnam, and India, according to her, is at the forefront of this transition towards sustainable energy. These countries have collectively contributed to around 60% of the global increase in renewable energy capacity in recent years.Transitioning to renewable energy is a critical step for the real estate industry to redefine buildings as active contributors through on-site renewable energy generation.\u201cThis trend extends beyond India, with real estate asset owners and occupiers across the Asia Pacific region increasingly demanding renewable energy and on-site renewable power sources,\u201d said Kamya Miglani, Head of ESG Research, Asia Pacific, JLL.According to her, by strategically choosing renewable energy sources and investing in buildings that are ready to actively engage with renewables-powered grids, there is significant scope to reduce long-term energy costs, while achieving sustainability goals within real estate portfolios.Embracing renewable energy is not only crucial but also viewed as a vital step for the real estate industry's transformation into active contributors to sustainability. Currently, less than 50% of occupiers in India meet their energy needs with renewable sources, but an impressive six out of ten aim to increase that to 90% by 2030. Collaboration between landlords and occupiers will play a pivotal role in meeting the growing demand for sustainable buildings.",

        "articleBody": "Harnessing renewable energy could revolutionise food security in the mountainous region of the Hindu Kush Himalayas, experts, including from India, said here on Tuesday. The remarks were made at a regional conference titled  Advancing Productive Uses of Renewable Energy in Agriculture in the Hindu Kush Himalayas  and hosted by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICOMOD) in collaboration with the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre, Nepal.  Over 100 participants, including development partners, civil society members, environmental experts, private sector representatives and government officials from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan attended the conference, according to a press release issued by the ICIMOD.   Rising temperatures are compounding the risks to food security in the mountains of the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH). Traditional irrigation methods and limited access to energy are hindering agricultural productivity in these high-altitude regions,  the experts pointed out.  The Hindu Kush Himalayas is a region that extends 3,500 km over Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan.  Clean energy - hydro, solar, biomass and wind - is abundant in the Hindu Kush Himalayas, the release said.  With rising temperatures compounding the risks to food security, experts argue that it's crucial that agriculture, which provides one-fifth of the region's gross domestic product, embrace renewables' potential to transform yields, and food security, and to transition away from polluting energy sources, it said.  During the conference, India's Dr Nitin Goel elaborated on how solar energy could be used for installing cold storage systems, a mechanism he developed in India. Another Indian expert, Prof Abid Haleem, demonstrated the relevance of Artificial Intelligence in agriculture such as weather forecasting and employing efficient paste plant control systems.  Niraj Shrestha of Nepal gave a presentation on solar thermal applications in Nepal's agriculture sector.  The participants at the conference explored the potential of renewable energy sources to transform mountain farming. The event brought together stakeholders to discuss strategies for scaling up these solutions for mountain communities in the HKH region, the release said.  In her keynote speech, Shabnam Shivakoti Aryal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, underscored the crucial role renewable energy could play in enhancing productivity in the agriculture sector.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Karnataka and Gujarat continue to lead the race to clean energy transition, but states like Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh need to step up efforts, according to a new report released on Tuesday. The joint report by research organisation, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), and clean energy think tank Ember evaluates the clean electricity transition preparedness at the sub-national level. The report's authors said Karnataka and Gujarat continue their strong performance across dimensions, effectively integrating renewable energy sources into their power sectors, making strong strides in decarbonisation. But states like Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh need to improve. While these states are in the early stages of their transition, they now need to focus on increasing renewable energy deployment, enhancing short term market participation and strengthening their distribution companies. The report launch coincides with a spell of intense heat wave sweeping parts of India, leading to the Ministry of Power preparing for a projected peak power demand of 260 gigawatts. Harsh summers also offer the chance to utilise more clean energy like solar power. Although, this requires preparedness of states to transition to clean sources of electricity.  Cyclical weather conditions coupled with faster economic activity is pushing India's peak electricity demand higher every year. While the central government is taking steps to integrate more renewable energy into the grid, states, too, need to be prepared to do so. Gauging sub-national progress now requires constant monitoring of several parameters at the state level. A purely national overview can often overshadow subtle intricacies at the state level, which may stymie the country's electricity transition,  the report's contributing author, Vibhuti Garg, Director, South Asia, IEEFA, said. While the national-level progress towards electricity transition is progressing well, it is far more uneven at the state level.  Some states have developed progressive steps, such as boosting decentralised renewable energy deployment, promoting solar pumps for agricultural needs, and enhancing storage solutions to ensure more renewable energy in their electricity systems. But, the transition to clean electricity is still in its infancy in many states.  These states should look to accelerate efforts to access benefits of a transition to clean electricity and to ensure they are not left too far behind the better-performing states,  the report's contributing author, Aditya Lolla, Asia Programme Director, Ember, said. One of the striking findings from the analysis for the 2024 report is that several states are exhibiting preparedness to embrace electricity transition. They perform well in the  Readiness and Performance of the Power Ecosystem  and  Market Enablers  dimensions but need to improve in the  Decarbonisation  dimension.  Delhi's power system is well-prepared for decarbonisation, while Odisha has robust market enablers to support decarbonisation in the power sector. However, their actual decarbonisation progress so far does not match their strengths in these aspects, highlighting the importance of performing well in both dimensions to effectively achieve decarbonisation goals,  co-author Neshwin Rodrigues, Electricity Policy Analyst, Ember, said. The report also notes that state-level decarbonisation can be further accelerated by strengthening the power ecosystem and having right enablers. Some states that are decarbonising well also lack the right market enablers, others struggle with the readiness of their power ecosystems. Kerala, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Maharashtra all exhibited considerable progress in certain aspects but also lower performance in other aspects. For example, Kerala and Punjab need to improve when it comes to market enablers for decarbonisation, while Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra need to focus on the readiness of their power ecosystems, according to co-author Tanya Rana, Energy Analyst, IEEFA.  Despite achieving relative success in decarbonising the sector thus far, states must address deficiencies in readiness and market enablers to sustain their momentum,  says Saloni Sachdeva Michael, Energy Specialist, India Clean Energy Transition, IEEFA. The report recognises the considerable efforts that states are making towards transitioning to clean electricity and recommends some key steps to accelerate the pace of transition.  We recommend the strengthening of state-level regulatory ecosystems. This not only ensures compliance but also promotes growth, data tracking and monitoring, and a conducive environment for business,  Michael said.  India has formulated many central and state-level policy schemes to reinforce its goal of energy independence by supporting various reforms and regulatory interventions across the value chain. However, actual implementation has not been adequate and transparent,  she added. The report also calls for a need to shift focus from national-level to state-level studies to understand the nuances of the electricity transition in India fully.  Each state faces unique challenges in decarbonising its power system, necessitating tailored policy interventions. By tracking decarbonisation progress, assessing the power system's readiness for transition, and monitoring the advancement of market enablers, state-specific challenges and potential interventions can be better understood,  Rodrigues said.",

        "articleBody": "The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking to leverage the household rooftop solar scheme to boost its grassroots outreach in its bid for a third term under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In the manifesto for 2024 Lok Sabha polls, BJP has outlined its vision for India's energy independence by 2047, emphasizing a strategic focus on electric mobility, charging infrastructure, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. This goal is set to coincide with the country's centenary celebration of independence from British colonial rule. We will achieve energy independence for Bharat by 2047 and reduce petroleum imports through a mix of electric mobility, network of charging stations, renewable energy production and improving energy efficiency,  read the manifesto.Having already positioned India at the forefront of the global energy transition with a target of achieving 300 GW of solar power capacity by 2030, the BJP's manifesto also includes plans to establish a center of excellence for clean energy. This initiative aims to bolster India's manufacturing capabilities in solar, wind, and green hydrogen, signaling a challenge to China's current dominance in the clean energy sector.The household rooftop solar scheme, a recent addition to the government's initiatives, provides subsidies for installing solar units and offers up to 300 units of free power per month to households. This program is part of a broader effort by the Modi government to ensure energy access for the underprivileged. Previous schemes such as 'Ujjwala,' which provides free LPG connections to women heading poor households, and initiatives for village electrification have already yielded positive outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for many beneficiaries. We will enable homes across Bharat to run devices like Electric Stoves, Fan, AC, TV among others and also enable EV charging through solar energy,  BJP said in its manifesto.The manifesto further commits to investing in emerging clean energy technologies like green hydrogen, as well as supporting nuclear power, ethanol, and bio-gas programs. These endeavors are not only aimed at advancing India's energy transition but also at benefiting farmers through sustainable energy solutions. Additionally, the party underscores the importance of developing smart grid infrastructure and fostering public-private partnerships to expand battery storage capacity, crucial for maintaining grid stability as renewable energy capacity grows.",

        "articleBody": "Built along a stretch of salt flats in southern India, the Tuticorin power plant epitomizes a quagmire for the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy: how to provide reliable energy to 1.4 billion people.For starters, the 1,050-megawatt coal plant, one of the region\u2019s largest, was supposed to shut down. Opened four decades ago, the facility is too cramped to install retrofits to meet the government\u2019s pollution norms, prompting India\u2019s power ministry to plan its closure by 2022. Yet the facility continues to run at full blast, clocking 90% utilization in February. Aging boilers guzzle coal from mines nearly 2,000 kilometers away \u2014 a transport distance that only adds to the nation\u2019s emissions footprint. Electricity consumption in India is growing at the fastest rate of any major economy, driven by rising temperatures and incomes, which have pushed up sales of power-intensive appliances like air conditioners. That explosive equation has exposed the country\u2019s teetering grid. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to rapidly build out solar and wind generation to replace polluting fossil fuels, his administration hasn\u2019t been able to keep up with demand, giving a second life to old, inefficient coal plants like the one in Tuticorin.In recent months, Modi has green-lit a fresh wave of power station development and extended the lifespan of many existing coal assets. It\u2019s a decision that puts India at odds with global allies who\u2019re shunning the fuel on climate grounds, threatening Modi\u2019s ambitions to curb air pollution and reduce the world\u2019s third-largest share of greenhouse gas emissions.Those dynamics will also hand the nation a crucial role in dictating the speed of the world\u2019s retreat from coal. Demand in China, currently the top consumer, probably peaked last year and the rate of future growth will increasingly be driven by India and Southeast Asia\u2019s rising economies, according to the International Energy Agency.\u201cThe message is clear to both the international and domestic audiences: We\u2019re all in for climate actions, but India\u2019s domestic interests will take priority,\u201d said Ashwini K. Swain, a fellow at Sustainable Futures Collaborative, a climate think tank in New Delhi.India\u2019s power ministry and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp., which runs the Tuticorin coal plant, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.India has a long way to go to ensure reliable and affordable electricity. In Oct. 2021, the country was hit by a massive coal and power crisis, just as the economy began to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. Years of weak demand had led to sluggish growth in mining, transportation and power generation capacities.Soon after the situation improved, officials realized the crisis wasn\u2019t a blip. Energy demand rose to a new high the following summer, causing the worst supply shortages in eight years. In 2023, even though that squeeze eased at the national level, Maharashtra, one of India\u2019s most industrialized states and home to its financial capital Mumbai, faced an alarming 10% peak deficit in August.While shortages raised expectations that the country would accelerate the shift to green energy, India\u2019s response was exactly the opposite. Officials pushed for more mining, abandoned plans to retire old power plants, raised targets to add coal-fired electricity and successfully lobbied international forums to adopt resolutions that wouldn\u2019t hinder fossil fuel use.\u201cAs a country, we should play to our strength, and coal is our strength,\u201d said Prakash Tiwari, a former operations director at state-run NTPC Ltd., the nation\u2019s largest power producer.Alternative energy solutions haven\u2019t yet caught on for financial, political and safety reasons.More than 35 miles from Tuticorin, a dusty road leads to two solar power plants surrounded by sprawling wind parks. Ayana Renewable Power, which runs one of the facilities, sees a future in renewable power with energy storage to serve industrial users. That trend is rising in India, although far from becoming a source of mass power supplies. Solar accounted for 6% of generation in 2023, according to Bloomberg calculations based on power ministry data.State-run power producer NLC India Ltd., which runs the other plant, is committing more than twice as much money to expanding mining, coal and lignite-fired power capacity than to building renewables, according to Chairman M. Prasanna Kumar.Natural gas, pushed by producers as a less-polluting alternative to coal, has also struggled to compete. Nearly 25 gigawatts of gas-fired power capacity has been idling for years, priced out by other power sources, including coal. India doesn\u2019t have enough domestically produced subsidized fuel to run the plants and operating these assets on imported liquefied natural gas is often too costly in India\u2019s price-competitive electricity market.Building hydropower dams is also fraught. Most of India\u2019s potential there is locked in the fragile Himalayan region, where frequent extreme weather events, such as flash floods, jeopardize projects. The risks have galvanized local opposition against large dams, delaying plans by years and adding to costs that have rendered many of them unpalatable.Nuclear power has seen a revival in many parts of the world for its low-emissions energy. But there, too, the industry in India has moved too slowly to make a mark and questions about safety persist. The nation\u2019s nuclear liability law holds vendors and suppliers responsible for accidents. Many are still haunted by the Bhopal gas tragedy of 1984, which killed thousands of people exposed to toxic chemicals.Consider Kudankulam, about 90 miles south of Tuticorin. The site hosts two reactors of 1 gigawatt each and four more are being added. In the nearby village of Idinthakarai, 52-year-old Mildred, who goes by one name, has been at the forefront of protesting the plant\u2019s construction. She\u2019s traveled across the country to discuss the risks of nuclear energy. \u201cWhy can\u2019t these be our main source of energy?\u201d the activist asked on a recent day, pointing to a few rotating wind turbines near her home.In 2008, India struck an agreement with the US to share nuclear technology and fuel, clearing the runway for new projects. India has also signed deals with foreign reactor suppliers, including General Electric-Hitachi, Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Areva SA, which later transfered the project to state-run peer Electricite de France SA. GE-Hitachi has since backed out, citing the liability law. In the western state of Maharashtra, India had planned to build the world\u2019s largest nuclear power plant, a mammoth 9.6 gigawatts facility near sprawling Alphonso mango orchards. But locals resisted selling their land when Kiran Dixit, then an executive director of the state monopoly Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd., visited the area.They thought prices were too low and worried that the plan would harm the livelihood of fishermen and the mango trees. The company tried to put those fears to rest and the land was eventually acquired, Dixit said. Still, the Jaitapur project has yet to significantly break ground as the two sides continue to discuss terms of the deal.",

        "articleBody": "South East Asia is  woefully off track  on green investments to reduce emissions and needs new policies and financial mechanisms to help bridge the gap, the global consultancy Bain & Company said on Monday. With energy consumption in the region expected to grow 40% this decade, climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions remain on the rise, with the region still dependent on fossil fuels, said an annual report compiled by Bain, green investment group GenZero, Standard Chartered Bank and Temasek. While green investment grew 20% last year, it is way short of the $1.5 trillion required this decade, and emissions in the 10 countries in the region could overshoot their 2030 pledges by 32% if they continue on their current trajectory, it warned.  We believe that an acceleration of effort by countries, corporates and investors is imperative as Southeast Asia remains woefully off-track,  said Kimberly Tan, GenZero's managing director. Clean energy accounts for just 10% of total supplies, and fossil fuel subsidies are around five times higher than renewable investments. High capital costs, as well as uncertain grid and tariff regulations, have also made it harder to finance renewable projects. The report said 60% of the region's coal-fired power plants were relatively new, meaning that they are still tied into long-term purchasing agreements and investment return commitments, making them far harder to shut down.  There is over $1 trillion of unrecovered capital in young coal plants and that's predominantly in Asia,  said Tim Gould, chief energy economist at the International Energy Agency.  It doesn't allow much room for renewables to grow ... so there is a need for creative financing approaches,  he told a conference in Singapore. Meanwhile, only four of the 10 countries in the region - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam - have made progress in putting a price on carbon. The report called for more policies and incentives, greater regional cooperation and a sustained focus on technologies that are already deployable.  The good news is that Southeast Asia is very early on its decarbonisation journey so benefits from having many levers to reduce emissions today,  said Tan.  Many of these are low-hanging fruit.  The report identified 13  investable ideas  that could bring in $150 billion in revenues by 2030, including sustainable agriculture and utility-scale renewable energy plants. South East Asia is the second worst performing region when it comes to renewables investment, behind only Sub-Saharan Africa, according to an April report by Singapore's Economic Development Board and the McKinsey consultancy. The report said annual solar installations needed to rise from the current rate of 5 gigawatts to 35 GW over the 2030-2050 period if regional net-zero pledges are to be met.  We have all the resources, but the 'unlock' isn't happening yet,  said Vishal Agarwal, a McKinsey senior partner. ",

However, industry experts said there is a need to add at least 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for the next six years to meet the ambitious target of 500 GW of renewables by 2030. According to the data, India's installed renewable energy capacity is 143.64 GW as of March 31, 2024, excluding 47 GW of large hydropower capacity (each plant is more than 25 GW or above). They pointed out that renewable energy capacity stood at around 190 GW, including large hydro projects, and therefore, India needs to add 310 GW in the next six years or at an average of 50 GW per annum.  Union Power and Renewable Energy Minister RK Singh, in a recent interview with PTI, said,  You see, my installed capacity of RE is about 190 GW, I have 103 GW under construction, that makes it 290 GW. I have 72 GW under bids, so I am already at about 360 GW. I will reach it (target of renewable energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030) before time as I reach all my targets . Besides, the MNRE is also targeting bidding of around 50 GW of renewable energy projects per annum to meet the ambitious target of 500 GW. The data showed that solar installations of 12.78GW led the renewable energy capacity addition of 15.27 GW in 2023-24, followed by 2.27 GW of wind energy. Among the renewable energy capacity, the total solar installed capacity tops the chart at 81.81GW, followed by about 46 GW of wind energy, 9.43 GW of biomass cogeneration and 5 GW of small hydro (up to 25 MW capacity each). Among the states, Gujarat and Rajasthan have the largest renewable energy capacities of about 27GW each, followed by Tamil Nadu at about 22 GW, Karnataka at about 21 GW and Maharashtra at about 17 GW. Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have installed renewable energy capacity of about 11 GW each.",

        "articleBody": "Global investors are increasingly moving away from the renewable energy sector funds this year due to concerns over the sector's growth prospects and uncertainty over policies in a U.S. election year, fund data show. Renewable energy sector funds witnessed steady inflows in the past few years, bolstered by consumers willingness to pay more for environmentally sustainable products and services and supportive policies in the United States and Europe. Now, however, the dampening impact of high interest rates on investment and uncertainty over future energy policies are challenging the renewable energy sector. BY THE NUMBERSLSEG Lipper data shows funds that invest in renewable energy stocks had an outflow of $4.8 billion in the first quarter of the year, marking the largest quarterly withdrawal to date. The Handelsbanken Hallbar Energi (A1 SEK) saw the biggest first-quarter outflows of $458 million, followed by iShares Global Clean Energy ETF and Ninety One Global Environment Fund R Acc GBP with $335 million and $226 million, respectively. The S&P Global Clean Energy index, comprised of major solar and wind power companies and other renewables-related businesses, is down nearly 10% this year, while the oil and gas-heavy S&P 500 Energy Index is up 16.3%. WHY IT'S IMPORTANTGlobal renewable energy capacity is expanding at a pace well short of what is needed to meet targets agreed at last year's COP28 climate summit in Dubai and dwindling investor interest could hinder progress towards achieving climate objectives. The world's top wind power groups, Siemens Energy , Orsted and Vestas, are forecasting a dire year for an industry buffeted by regulatory delays, equipment problems and rising costs. In the United States, many solar, wind and energy storage projects have benefited from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022. Now there is concern Donald Trump could undo some of the tax breaks and pivot back to supporting fossil fuel production if he wins November's election. KEY QUOTES With conventional energy having its own bull run, I think the alternative funds will struggle for the foreseeable future, and we shall see what the election brings,  said Matt Willer, managing director of capital markets at Phoenix Capital Group Holdings.",

        "articleBody": "The Technology Development Board (TDB) under the science & technology ministry has partnered with a private entity to establish a commercial plant for recycling lithium-ion batteries (LIB) and e-waste using indigenous technology in Uttarakhand. This move aims to enhance circularity and lessen the country's reliance on imported critical mineral resources.Presently, a large portion of LIBs, about 95%, end up in landfills without recycling, while only 5% undergo the process. The lithium-ion battery recycling market is expected to grow significantly, reaching close to $15 billion by 2030, showing a compound annual growth rate of 21.6%. In 2021, the market size was $3.8 billion. Improper disposal of LIBs through landfilling and incineration poses environmental and health risks. Effective recycling will not only provide secondary raw materials for cell manufacturing domestically but also help in averting health hazards.Moreover, e-waste poses a substantial challenge, with approximately 78% of it not being collected in India. This results in valuable secondary raw materials like gold, silver, copper, and rare earth elements being left in dump yards or landfills. India is currently the third-largest generator of e-waste globally.The Technology Development Board recently sealed a deal with Remine India Private Limited to establish the recycling plant in Sitarganj, Uttarakhand, with a total project cost of Rs 15 crore. TDB has committed financial assistance of Rs 7.5 crore towards the project, emphasizing a significant step towards sustainable development and environmental responsibility.TDB's Secretary, Rajesh Kumar Pathak, said that the board's support will facilitate informal recyclers to collaborate with formal recyclers, promoting a circular economy. The indigenous technology utilized for the plant is developed by the Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology (CMET) based in Hyderabad.",

        "articleBody": "Coal is projected to continue as the backbone of the Indian energy system until the next two decades and its phase-down will require active policies on critical minerals, according to a report by the Indian Institute of Management (IIM)- Ahmedabad.The report asserted that net zero is not possible without substantial nuclear power and renewable energy generation by 2070.The report, titled 'Synchronising energy transitions towards a possible Net Zero for India: Affordable and Clean Energy for All,' was released on Wednesday.The report was launched by Prof Ajay Kumar Sood, Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA), to the Government of India in the presence of dignitaries Dr V K Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog; Dr A. K. Mohanty, Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC); and other senior officials.To achieve net-zero energy systems by 2070, the report mentioned that the electricity sector will need to decarbonise well before that. There is no silver bullet to achieve net-zero. The transition needs multiple pathways to be adopted with the co-existence of myriad technologies in our energy basket. Coal is projected to continue until the next two decades as the backbone of the Indian energy system,  it said.The report said India's emissions would range between 0.56 btCO2 (billion-tonne of carbon dioxide) and 1.0 btCO2 in 2070. It is expected that the remaining gap in emissions will be offset through sequestration in forestry and tree cover as envisaged in our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),  the report mentioned. Clean, affordable electricity at low levelized cost of electricity (for consumers) can be achieved in net-zero pathways, especially with a focus on nuclear power and renewable power. Widespread electrification of end-use sectors, i.e. up to 47-52 per cent of the electricity share in Total Final Electricity Consumption (TFEC), compared to 18% at present,  it said.The report was prepared by IIM Ahmedabad as part of a study project which was sanctioned in November 2021 by the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India with part-funding (one-third) from Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL)Prof Ajay Sood stated in his opening remarks that the report is a comprehensive study, bringing together aspects from all sectors of power generation in one place, providing a holistic view of the Indian energy sector and throwing light on the potential pathways for a development-led transition to net zero.Dr Anil Kakodkar, former Chairman, AEC, welcomed the study as the need of the hour, which is an energy transitions study done from India's perspective. He also highlighted the need for the development of technologies for low-cost hydrogen production. ",

Implemented by the Ministry of Heavy Industries, the new scheme has come into effect from April 1 after the end of the FAME scheme on March 31..The govt had earlier said that subsidies under the second phase of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India (FAME-II) programme scheme will be eligible for e-vehicles sold till March 31, or till the time funds are available.The new INR 500 crore scheme has thus came into force from Monday and continue till the end of July. Named as Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme 2024 (EMPS 2024), the new scheme will offer support of up to INR 10,000 per two-wheeler for about 3.33 lakh two-wheelers.For small three-wheelers (e-rickshaw and e-carts), the new scheme has provision for up to INR 25,000 subsidy for over 41,000 such vehicles.The financial support will be up to INR 50,000 in case of a large three-wheeler.The EMPS 2024, a limited fund scheme of INR 500 crore for four months, aims to boost the adoption of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers from April 1 to July 31, 2024. The Heavy Industries Ministry unveiled this initiative on March 13 to propel green mobility and enhance the EV manufacturing ecosystem. The scheme targets supporting 3,72,215 EVs, specifically prioritizing vehicles equipped with advanced batteries for incentives. Aligned with the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, EMPS 2024 focuses on fostering a competitive and resilient EV manufacturing industry in India. The adoption of the Phased Manufacturing Programme under this scheme promotes domestic manufacturing and strengthens the EV supply chain, paving the way for increased employment opportunities across the value chain.",

Nation-building impulse is as relevant now as it was earlier. There are major energy transitions, digital transitions in the form of AI and machine learning, and supply chain transitions that we are facing today. But, India is uniquely placed because we can invest in each of these transitions today because of the geopolitical advantages that our country has,  he said. He said that by 2030, the Tata Group will move to 70 per cent green energy. Chandrasekaran said the priorities of the conglomerate are simplification, synergy, sustainability, supply chain transformation and digital transformation.  These are achieved via integrity, sound strategy, great execution, good governance and consistent practice,  he said. He asked the students to follow three mantras for a successful career -- positive attitude, a winning set and the ability to work hard.  Being the next generation of leaders, India awaits your contribution in the form of the story you will create,  he told the students. At the convocation, 552 students received their diplomas.",

Tatas, Mahindras or  anybody from the world  can now come to India and create an ecosystem aligned to the EV sector, Goyal told reporters here. The EV policy, which promises duty concessions for EV makers investing a minimum of USD 500 million, is reportedly aimed at attracting leading EV makers to set up a base in the country.   We are now inviting companies from the world over to come to India, the production of EVs should expand in India at a quick pace and we should emerge as a Vishwa Shakti (global power),  Goyal said, speaking on the decision announced a few hours earlier from the national capital. India will also be able to export the EVs manufactured in the country and the overall turnover from the activity can breach  lakhs of crore , the minister said. The EV ecosystem creation includes many facets like focusing on parts, design, auto components etc, Goyal said, adding that it can create employment for lakhs of Indians. He said the Indian consumer will be a big beneficiary of such a move, because she will be able to get best of the vehicles for cheap. The policy will also help save forex as the imports go down, which will lead to a slew of advantages, including lower inflation and softer interest rates, Goyal said. Goyal, who has been fielded from the Mumbai North constituency by the BJP, also announced that government e-marketplace (GeM) portal's overall procurement will double to Rs 4 lakh crore in FY24, adding that it has already touched Rs 3.82 lakh crore. This will take the overall volume of procurement from the platform to Rs 8 lakh crore since its launch, Goyal said and also cited independent studies to claim that over 12 per cent of public funds have been saved because of the initiative. Earlier in the day, Goyal attended an event where NTC (National Textile Corporation) workers were given salary arrears till December 2021. The minister blamed the poor financial health of the corporation which has impacted its cash flows, along with the Covid pandemic for the difficulties faced by the workers in getting their salaries. In the next 30-40 days, days, dues for another eight months will be paid, Goyal said, adding that the attempt is to get the salaries  up to date  by ceasing to have any arrears. The minister also launched a service for which the Ministry of Consumer Affairs has tied up with Isro, which will enable all mobile service providers to synchronize with Indian Standard Time (IST) and also aid in synchronizing real-time applications in strategic sectors for national security. He also inaugurated Video Conferencing facilities installed in State Consumer Commission offices at Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Centre is preparing a payment security mechanism (PSM) to catalyse procurement of 150,000 electric buses (e-buses). The mechanism will insulate e-bus suppliers from ill health of state transport utilities (STUs) which operate them, according to officials. Under the present model, e-buses are procured by central agencies and then handed over to STUs, which operate the buses and recover costs. The STUs are then responsible for paying back the bus makers.Inefficiencies in fare collection and improper upkeep of buses hampers viability of such operations. E-bus suppliers have been asking for a central government-backed payment security mechanism to ensure they are paid for the vehicles they supply. The lack of such a mechanism has hampered recent attempts to deploy e-buses.In the interim budget for 2024-25, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that the Centre will expand and strengthen the e-vehicle ecosystem by supporting manufacturing and charging infrastructure.  Greater adoption of e-buses for public transport networks will be encouraged through payment security mechanism,  she said.108407215As per industry estimates, \u20b91.2-1.5 lakh crore will be required to deploy 100,000 e-buses.  The government is in the process of consulting stakeholders to draw up the contours of a PSM scheme to realise these objectives,  a senior government official told ET on condition of anonymity. The PSM will kick in when a state government or transport utility defaults on payments to bus makers.There are about 4.000 electric buses running on Indian roads today, compared to a total of 1.5 million diesel and CNG buses operating in the country.In August 2023, the Centre launched the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme aiming to deploy 10,000 e-buses under the public-private partnership model. The scheme is estimated to cost \u20b957,613 crore over the next decade. The Centre will provide Rs 20,000 crore of this amount from its kitty while the rest will be collected from states and the private sector.According to Amit Goyal, chair, PHDCCI Housing and Urban Development Committee, there needs to be a fast roll-out of the recently announced PM-eBus Sewa scheme for 169 cities.  Electric buses are the way forward for smaller cities, especially in hill cities,  he said.Convergence Energy Services Limited, a green energy-focused venture of the public sector undertaking Energy Efficiency Services Limited, recently sought proposals for the selection of operator for procurement, supply, operation and maintenance of 3,600 e-buses. CESL is seeking the buses and development of allied electric and civil infrastructure on gross cost contracting under the PM-eBus Sewa.",

        "articleBody": "The prices of high-end electric vehicles in Karnataka are set to increase as the state government has decided to collect a lifetime tax of 10% of the vehicle's cost at the time of registration. The new rule will apply to electric cars, jeeps, and buses, the govt said in a notification. Karnataka has been giving tax exemption for EVs for the last seven years, irrespective of the price range, to promote eco-friendly mobility systems. However, the govt is now rethinking its policy in view of the increasing number of luxury EVs which are being brought by the affluent people. The government estimates that by 2030, there will be around 23 lakh electric vehicles in Bengaluru alone, compared to the 80,000 currently in circulation in 2021. Across the state, the number of electric vehicles has already surpassed 3 lakh. Initially, there was a proposal to impose a lifetime tax on vehicles costing above Rs 20 lakh, but with the approval of the state government, the threshold has been revised to above Rs 25 lakh. After receiving consent from the governor, the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation (Amendment) Act was published in the special state gazette, paving the way for the implementation of this tax.Apart from electric vehicles, petrol and diesel-driven transport and commercial vehicles will also face increased costs for registration. The amendment to the Act introduces a 3% cess on transport vehicles, with the aim of generating a fund for the welfare of drivers and other workers in the transport sector. The Act states,  In addition to the existing cess of the tax levied under Section 3 on motor vehicles registered under Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Central Act 59 of 1988), three percent additional cess shall be levied and collected on transport vehicles for the purpose of Karnataka Motor Transport and Other Allied Workers Social Security and Welfare Fund.  This move is expected to generate approximately Rs 100 crore annually to support social security and welfare schemes in the unorganized sector.",

        "articleBody": "West Bengal can save a significant Rs 62,000 crore over a decade by transitioning from thermal power to embracing renewable energy sources, a study by think tank Climate Risk Horizons (CRH) said on Thursday. This transition could also play a pivotal role in helping India achieve its net zero emissions target, it said.  Rising costs of coal-fired electricity underscore the potential missed opportunity in West Bengal's focus on renewable energy. Correcting this oversight could yield substantial financial gains for both the state and its electricity consumers,  said Vishnu Teja, the analyst of the report. According to the report, about 97 per cent of West Bengal's power is now coal-based, with only a meagre 200 MW of wind and solar capacity. The report also highlights that many of the state's coal power units are over 20 years old and nearing the end of their operational life.  Phasing out these older plants would lead to immediate savings by avoiding retrofit costs and penalties for non-compliance with emission norms,  the report mentioned. The CRH report recommends halting greenfield thermal power projects costing nearly Rs 25,000 crore and redirecting these investments towards renewable energy and grid strengthening.  Given the rising costs of dry fuel and the increasing attractiveness of renewables on multiple grounds, the funds should be diverted towards renewables ecosystem to yield substantial savings,  the report stated. For instance, replacing higher-cost power contracts from centrally-owned coal plants with cheaper renewable energy could save up to Rs 318 crore annually, the report said. It also underscores the potential savings from electrifying irrigation pumps with PV solar, estimating an annual saving of Rs 20,720 crore for rice cultivation alone. Savings from replacing thermal generation of Central and state-owned TPPs, in the state with RE at Rs 2.7/kWh will save about Rs 12,700 crore in 10 years. However, building up the state's renewable energy portfolio will require upfront capital investments in RE, battery storage, etc. Recognising the need for capital for deployment of the transition, Ashish Fernandes CEO of Climate Risk Horizons said,  The state government can tap the growing green bond market directly, or in partnership with the private sector, to finance these initiatives.  The state government had stated that it has plans to build a 1,760 MW solar capacity, 1,000 MW from the Turga Pumped storage power plant, and receive 230 MW from Bhutan and 118 MW from Teesta hydel projects. The state is also heavily deploying rooftop solar panels at educational and office buildings.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi [India], February 28 (ANI): As India endeavors to scale up its renewable energy capacity, it faces a conundrum, despite targets for renewable power generation, the nation is poised for significant growth in fossil fuel-fired power generation in the coming years.This dilemma, highlighted by BP chief economist Spencer Dale, underscores the mounting sense of  frustration and anger  in developing economies over Western-imposed climate policies. Even if that happens, the country will still need to boost coal- and/or gas-fired generation to meet forecasts of energy demand growth , Dale said.India, a key player in global energy dynamics and one of the world's largest oil importers, aims to triple its renewable power generation capacity by 2030, reaching around 500 GW under its clean energy targets, as mentioned in insights by S&P Global Commodity Insights.However, even with this ambitious goal in sight, the country is expected to rely on coal- and/or gas-fired generation to meet the projected growth in energy demand.Dale emphasized that even if India successfully triples its solar and wind capacity, it would still only meet 75 per cent of the anticipated growth in power demand by 2030. Even if they did that and they put everything into power demand, they would still only meet 75 per cent of the expected growth in power demand to 2030. To meet that demand you would need either a 20 per cent increase in coal-fired generation or a tripling of gas-fired generation. That is what they mean about imposing Western blueprints on developing economies , said Dale.To bridge this gap, India would need to either increase coal-fired generation by 20% or triple gas-fired generation, highlighting the challenges of aligning energy demand with renewable energy targets.The BP economist's remarks stem from recent discussions with high-level energy officials in India regarding the country's path to achieving net-zero targets.Dale said,  The reflection followed a recent meeting with high-level energy officials in India over what would be required to meet net-zero targets in the country .According to Dale, the prevailing sentiment among Indian officials reflects a mixture of frustration and anger over Western nations imposing their climate solutions on the developing world.Key concerns raised during these discussions include challenges related to financing, as well as the lending standards of banks and financial institutions.There is a growing emphasis on whether climate initiatives are tailored to address the unique needs and energy requirements of developing economies or merely replicate Western blueprints without considering local contexts.India's pursuit of membership in the International Energy Agency (IEA) adds another dimension to its energy landscape. Following recent negotiations for full membership, hailed as a  revolutionary  development by the IEA, India stands at the cusp of deeper engagement with global energy governance. The main theme was a spectrum of frustration and anger about the West imposing their climate solutions on the world. So, financing is a challenge, the lending standards of banks and financial institutions. Are you imposing the Western blueprint or are you engaging with their needs and arithmetic as they face the energy challenge?  Dale said.The potential inclusion of India in the IEA's membership underscores the agency's commitment to bolstering global energy security while accelerating climate action.As India navigates the complex terrain of energy transition, balancing the imperative of reducing carbon emissions with meeting growing energy demands remains a formidable challenge.

        "articleBody": "In a bid to promote electric vehicles and solar energy, the Indian government has made some crucial changes in the electricity Act.According to Union minister for power and new & renewable energy R. K. Singh, the amendments will facilitate easier and faster installation of rooftop solar systems by exempting systems up to 10 kW from the requirement of a technical feasibility study and reducing the timeline for systems above 10 kW from twenty days to fifteen days. These changes will also strengthen consumer rights and promote the adoption of renewable energy.Under the new regulations, consumers are now able to obtain separate electricity connections specifically for EVs. Additionally, the amendments seek to streamline the process for new electricity connections, substantially reducing waiting periods across different areas. For instance, the waiting period has been shortened from seven days to three days in metropolitan areas, from fifteen days to seven days in municipal areas, and from thirty days to fifteen days in rural areas, with the exception of rural hilly terrains where it remains at thirty days.Furthermore, distribution companies are now responsible for the system strengthening of rooftop solar PV systems up to 5 kW at their own expense. The timeline for commissioning these systems has been halved from thirty days to fifteen days.In a bid to offer more flexibility and transparency to consumers residing in residential colonies and flats, the amendments introduce the option to choose between individual connections or a single-point connection for the entire premises. This choice is to be determined through a transparent ballot conducted by the distribution company, ensuring fairness in tariffs and separate metering, billing, and collection for individual electricity consumption, backup power, and common areas.To address complaints regarding meter readings, distribution licensees are now mandated to install a check meter within five days to verify electricity consumption for a minimum period of three months, aiming to ensure billing accuracy and enhance consumer confidence.Minister Singh emphasized that the government, prioritizing consumer interests, introduced the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules in December 2020. He further stated that these latest amendments aim to empower consumers, drive renewable energy adoption, and elevate service standards within the electricity distribution sector.",

        "articleBody": "BENGALURU: Just a few years ago, someone who wanted to install a rooftop solar connection in India faced getting multiple approvals, finding a reliable company to install the panels and spending heavily before seeing the first surge of clean energy. But that's changing. The government has streamlined the approvals process, made it easier for people to claim subsidies and pushed mountains of cash - including $9 billion announced this month - to encourage faster adoption of technology that's seen as critical for India to reach its clean-energy goals.  We had to get 45 signatures to set up a small rooftop solar connection in 2021,  said Shreya Mishra, CEO of Mumbai-based Solar Square, one of India's largest rooftop solar companies.  Today it's almost instantaneous.  For this sun-soaked country, growth in rooftop solar can't come soon enough. India last year became the world's most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people and a hunger for energy that is rising fast.  Yet India, one of the world's biggest emitters of planet-warming gases, is also highly vulnerable to climate change. Its people are affected by deadly floods, extreme rainfall, extreme heat, prolonged droughts and cyclones with increasing frequency. A study earlier this year found that nine out of India's 28 states will be among the world's hardest-hit regions due to climate change by midcentury.  India has grown its clean power rapidly in recent years and has the fourth-most installed renewable power, trailing only China, the U.S. and Brazil. It had 180 gigawatts as of December, enough to power about 18 million homes, with nearly half from solar. But most of that solar power comes from numerous football-field-sized solar farms. Less than 15% comes from rooftop arrays, and India has so far managed to set up only 11 gigawatts of rooftop solar. That's far less than the 40 gigawatts it hoped to have by 2022.  Energy experts say rooftop solar is essential to bring power to remote areas, where it can be installed cheaply where it's needed and avoid the cost of transmitting the energy over long distances. India's latest push was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said the $9 billion would provide  free electricity  for up to 10 million homes. Neeraj Kuldeep of the New Delhi-based think tank, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, has tracked rooftop solar for nearly a decade. A report from CEEW last year found that only 50% of Indians are likely aware of rooftop solar as an energy solution and most of those who were aware thought it was too expensive. The report released last November recommended subsidies for consumers who can benefit from small rooftop solar arrays but can't afford them. Kuldeep said consumer awareness about rooftop solar is one key to driving growth. Others are efficient governments at both the federal and state level, and finding the right  fit  for a particular user's power needs. Experts say another is getting buy-in from state-owned electricity companies who sometimes see rooftop solar as a threat to their profits.  Kuldeep said that's short-sighted. The companies can often actually make more money if they help install rooftop solar in a low-consumption home, he said. That's because they cut their transmission and distribution costs to carry power to a house with a subsidized bill that already earns them little profit. Installations have also risen since the government launched a national rooftop solar portal in 2022 that consumers can use to claim and steer government subsidies directly to their bank account, say experts and rooftop solar companies. Mysun, a rooftop solar company based in New Delhi, offers potential buyers a  solar calculator  on its website where they can enter their location and current electricity costs to see what kind of savings they could expect. CEO Gagan Vermani said it's about simplifying the process for potential customers.  We need to start thinking of (rooftop solar) with consumer needs in mind rather than thinking of it as building solar infrastructure,  he said. Those who are already hooked up with panels on their roofs tout the benefits of cheaper electricity and greater agency over their own power.  It is a little expensive but it's totally worth it,  said Ruchika Chahana, who lives in the affluent Greater Kailash neighborhood in New Delhi. Chahana installed rooftop solar in her home nine months ago at a cost of nearly $5,000. She said her summer electricity bills have fallen to about $50 a month, from $200, and her family feels great about  doing something to save the planet.  In Bengaluru, Satish Mallya saw rooftop solar as essential both to save money and avert carbon emissions. He took the lead in installing 65 kilowatts of solar atop the 120-unit apartment complex he lives in, and the building's electricity costs have dropped $700 a month. That 2020 installation was  challenging  because of bureaucratic hurdles, said Mallya, who serves as vice president of a citywide group that represents apartment dwellers and owners. He's helped many others set up their own rooftop solar connections in the years since, and says the process has gotten easier.  Mishra, of Solar Square, said she's seeing a big increase in interest in a technology that she calls  a key part of India's energy future.   As an Indian and an entrepreneur, I'm extremely proud of seeing this getting built up,  she said.  I think building energy infrastructure is the greatest nation-building thing we can do. ",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi [India], February 15 (ANI): India will need Rs 30 lakh crores in investment during financial year 2024-2030 to meet its COP climate pledges, said IREDA CMD Pradip Kumar Das.Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA), Pradip Kumar Das, addressed an international webinar organized by the World Bank, on the occasion of the release of the latest South Asia Development Update  Toward Faster, Cleaner Growth , on Wednesday.In his address, CMD, IREDA underscored the critical need for substantial investment to meet India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) goals by 2030. He said investment is required in manufacturing of capacity for Solar, Electrolysers, Wind and Battery; Transmission, Green Hydrogen, Solar, Hydro, Wind, and Waste to Energy sectors.Speaking about the significance of  PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana , the rooftop solar scheme launched on Tuesday, the CMD said,  This initiative is poised to elevate the Rooftop Solar sector to unprecedented heights in the country. The scheme will not only provide substantial benefits but also foster awareness about renewable energy among the people-at-large, contributing to India's ambitious goal of achieving Net-Zero emissions by 2070 and Energy Independence by 2047. The rooftop solar project, with an investment of over Rs 75,000 crores, aims to light up 1 crore households by providing up to 300 units of free electricity every month.The CMD said that India's rise has been a role model for Renewable Energy development worldwide, several initiatives of the government such as Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO), PM-KUSUM scheme, 'Must-run' status for RE assets, PLI scheme for Solar PV manufacturing, and the allowance of up to 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route for renewable energy. As India aims to become the third-largest economy in next three years and a developed country by 2047, there will be a significant energy demand to achieve energy security and energy-independence. Approximately 90 per cent of this demand is expected to be met through renewable sources. Until sufficient energy storage for renewable energy is achieved, thermal energy will also be developed alongside. The CMD also spoke of the motherly role that IREDA has played over the last 37 years, in nurturing the Renewable Energy sector in India. India meets a sizable portion of its energy needs through coal-fired electricity, and this solar rooftop programme could be seen as an avenue to reduce the dependence of conventional sources of power.At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part  Panchamrit  pledge. They included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, to reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030.India as a whole also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070.About 44 per cent of India's energy requirements at present come from non-fossil sources and are likely to touch as high as 65 per cent by 2030, much higher than what the country pledged at the COP summit in 2021, Union Minister RK Singh, who handles power and renewable portfolio, said recently.",

In a recorded message for the ministerial meeting of the IEA, he said India has surpassed its Paris climate targets ahead of schedule and remains firmly committed to addressing the global issue.Prime Minister Modi said India's carbon emissions account for only four per cent of the global total despite it being home to 17 per cent of the global population and undertaking some of the world's largest energy access initiatives. Congratulating the IEA on its 50th anniversary, the prime minister said,  I am sure that the IEA will benefit when India plays a bigger role in it.   Inclusivity boosts the credibility and capability of any institution,  he said and added that  1.4 billion Indians bring talent, technology and innovation to the table .  We bring scale and speed, quantity and quality to every mission,  Modi said. Noting that India is the world's fastest growing major economy, he said sustained growth needs energy security and sustainability.  In one decade, we went from the 11th largest economy to the fifth largest. In the same period, our solar energy capacity grew twenty six fold. Our renewable energy capacity also doubled. We exceeded our Paris commitments in this regard, ahead of timelines,  the prime minister said.  However, we are firmly committed to combating climate change,  he said. India achieved its emissions intensity-related targets 11 years ahead of the committed time-frame and non-fossil fuel targets nine years ahead of schedule. The country now aims to reduce emissions intensity of gross domestic product by 45 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels and achieve 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. It has also committed to become a net-zero economy by 2070. Modi also highlighted India's proactive approach in leading initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and the Mission LiFE, which focuses on pro-planet lifestyle choices. He thanked the IEA for supporting initiatives such as the Global Biofuels Alliance launched during India's G20 Presidency.",

Others at the pre-bid meeting included TVS Lucas, Ather, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), Amara Raja, Exide and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL).The participation of the South Korean company is notable because a similarly named Hyundai Global Motors had got sops for setting up a 20 gigawatt hour (GWh) capacity in the earlier PLI auction round for ACC batteries, held in January 2022. It was eventually concluded that this was a case of impersonation and that Hyundai Global Motors had used fake documentation while bidding. ET first reported this in July 2022. Subsequently, the ministry of heavy industries (MHI) cancelled the capacity awarded to Hyundai Global Motors and called for rebids for the vacated capacity after a two-year gap.Only 10 GWh up for BiddingThe development comes in the wake of ET\u2019s February 5 report that Hyundai is considering listing its local unit in India. The company already has electric vehicle related plans.\u201cAny investments that the company makes, if it submits bids and is approved under the scheme, will be over and above the resources Hyundai is ploughing in to set up a battery assembly unit in Tamil Nadu,\u201d said one of the officials who confirmed the development. In 2022, MHI had awarded incentives worth Rs 18,100 crore for setting up 50 GWh of manufacturing capacity by 2030. Ola Cell Technologies won the lion\u2019s share with 20 GWh capacity. ACC Energy Storage, bidding as Rajesh Exports, and Reliance New Energy Battery Storage were awarded incentives for 5 GWh each.The advanced chemistry cell PLI scheme has undergone a change since the previous round and elements of battery end-use have been incorporated. Of the 20 GWh awarded and taken back, only 10 GWh is up for bidding. Under the revised programme, this is meant for electric vehicle (EV) related battery applications. Bids for the remaining 10 GWh will separately be called\u2014that will be for stationary battery applications such as solar power as well as grid balancing.\u201cThere will be proper due diligence before bids are awarded to prevent a repeat of the earlier conundrum,\u201d a senior government official said.In January this year, Hyundai Motor India said it was looking at investing Rs 6,180 crore in Tamil Nadu to set up, among others, a hydrogen research centre in the state. The company is already in the process of investing Rs 20,000 crore (2023-2032) in Tamil Nadu to develop charging infrastructure and create an ecosystem for EV manufacturing.Separately, Hyundai is also looking at investing Rs 7,000 crore in Maharashtra, where it has signed an agreement for acquiring General Motors\u2019 defunct manufacturing facility in Talegaon.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: About 44 per cent of India's energy requirements at present come from non-fossil sources and are likely to touch as high as 65 per cent by 2030, much higher than what the country pledged at the COP summit in 2021, said Union Minister RK Singh.At COP26 held in 2021 in Glasgow, India committed to an ambitious five-part  Panchamrit  pledge. They included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, to reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030.India as a whole also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070. At COP26 we pledged that by 2030 we will have 50 per cent of our capacity which will be non-fossils, mostly renewables. If fact it would be actually 60-65 per cent. We will be way beyond what we pledged,  the minister who handles power and renewable portfolio said at The Energy and Resources Institute's World Sustainable Development Summit 2024 on Friday evening.The minister said that 103,000 megawatts of renewable capacity is under construction in India, and 71,000 megawatts is under bid, which according to him was unmatched. Our rate and speed and scale of the energy transition is perhaps unmatched. We are the only one who is issuing bids for round-the-clock renewable energy. We are the only country that is adding storage as a mission to bring the price of storage down,  he said.India's per capita emission is one of lowest at 2.0-2.6 tonnes, against the world average of 6.8 tonnes, he asserted. Developed countries have become developed by using fossil fuels. 77 per cent of the legacy carbon dioxide load on our planet earth was caused directly by them, which has led to the rise in global temperature. Whereas India with 17 per cent of the global population contributes to just 3 per cent of the legacy carbon dioxide load, he said. The rate at which the developed countries are spewing emissions, if they continue at this rate. The available time before we reach that 1.5 degree rise in global temperature is just 4.5 years. But we don't see any signs of their reducing their pace of emission,  he quipped.He suggested that developing countries need carbon space to become developed, and supported his argument by saying that the developed countries' per capita emission is perhaps four times the global average.High per capita emission is the nub of the problem, he asserted. Developed countries must realise that no country in the world is going to compromise on their development no matter how many speeches you give. You need to vacate carbon space so that the developing countries can develop,  he added.Further, he said that developed countries must be assisted with finance and access to technology.  We need to bring down the price of energy transition, otherwise it won't come down.  ",

A CCUS policy is likely to be published later this year, officials said. Options like carbon credits, subsidies, or providing VGF for projects are being considered to give a push to carbon capture and usage,  said a senior industry official, adding that such incentives will open up a $10 billion opportunity for the industry over the next five years as new product lines like green ammonia, green urea, green hydrogen etc will open up.In the fight against climate change, processes for CCUS are essential. It will not only reduce emissions but also help oil and gas companies use the captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) from mature oil fields or for the production of chemicals. All major economies have CCUS projects under operation and execution. For instance, in the US, manufacturers that capture carbon from operations can earn tax credit to the tune of $50 per metric ton of CO2 if stored permanently or $35 per metric tonne of CO2 if the CO2 is used, such as for EOR.Officials added that India may consider something similar.  Currently the cost of CO2 at around $58-60 per tonne from a refinery is very high. For it to be viable, we need to work it down,  the first official added.107502856As the third-largest CO2 emitter in the world, India has decided to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 33- 35% by 2030. We are looking at the CCUS models from the US and Europe. But we must tailor it for India as India has a multi-layered strata. We can't be as stringent as Europe as we are still a coal-based economy. So one has to see that the new CCUS policy does not become a deterrent for the growth of the industries,  the second official said.",

        "articleBody": "There has never been a compelling reason for humanity to recognise a North-South world - until now. Climate change, the biggest and most rapid environmental transformation humanity has ever experienced, tilts our planet's strategic axis from west-east to south-north. With every lifeform on the planet instinctively migrating toward the poles, our world enters a decades-long period of turbulence - a geopolitical reorganisation of the world order.Our planet's lower latitudes, or what I dub Middle Earth, will suffer the harshest environmental transformation over the next several decades. Stretching 30 degrees north and south of the equator and home to more than half of humanity, much of Middle Earth will later this century regularly endure a climate like today's Saharan Desert, meaning an average temperature approaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit with extremely low rainfall.The Sahara thus previews the coming geopolitical attrition: sparse populations, weak states, ungoverned spaces, and bad actors galore. Climate change already renders portions of Middle Earth economically unfeasible, contributing to state failure like in Sudan today. A good example are Central America's Northern Triangle states of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador - the so-called Dry Corridor that already sends waves of food-insecure climate refugees to America's southern border in search of a more sustainable existence.Come mid-century, three billion or so humans living across Middle Earth will find their lands rendered close-to-unlivable by historical human standards. Like all those migrating species, many of these beleaguered souls will stream northward, where climate change will gift roughly two Australias' worth of livable land to an octet of advanced Arctic economies - America included - in one of history's great ironies. In combination, the South's loss and the North's gain will constitute an unprecedented- and uncompensated - transfer of land-based wealth.The North can try to geographically contain the South's threatening instabilities. In extremis, we can even go full Escape From New York on those typically far weaker Southern states-like Donald Trump's wall scheme supposedly protected Americans from Mexico's criminals. But unless we are prepared to accept a Mad Max dystopia in these godforsaken regions, we must imagine a more humane and advantageous path.The United States currently pursues a strategy of limited regret with Middle Earth's slate of fragile states. We send foreign aid. When that is not enough, we send military personnel to train local security forces. And when that fails, we send in Special Forces to kill their bad actors. This narrow approach will not suffice in coming decades.Today, the European Union has its model of political integration known as accession, while China aggressively markets its model of economic integration known as the Belt and Road Initiative. Meanwhile, Washington largely limits its offerings to military assistance and alliances.America needs to elevate its game by innovating new forms of state affiliation for connecting South to North. These must broker more viable forms of statehood in the former while modulating the flow of climate refugees to the latter, the goal being to keep the South's most resilient populations in place while accommodating the most vulnerable.107502850Climate change forces all species - and all nations - to adapt, move, or die.Let us not forget that America began as 13 fractious colonies and now boasts a membership of 574 sovereign Native American nations, 50 states (two non-contiguous), 14 territories, and one federal district. We know how to evolve and grow our Union; we simply shelved that skillset.Ultimately, the North must develop new multilateral schemes that enable the pooling of political sovereignty among stronger Northern states and their more vulnerable Southern counterparts - socialising this unprecedented geopolitical risk across a wider community of nations. Doing nothing will yield great violence while exacting great cost.For decades, the Global South has requested some form of a  new international economic order.  What these nations have long heard from the collective North is that we are too busy with our east-west conflicts and rivalries - Ukraine being the latest. The North's superpowers are only beginning to acknowledge the South's profound fears and dread concerning climate change.That combustible mix of emotions is presently exploited by both China and Russia as they seek to enlist the Global South against the increasingly divided West. Meanwhile, rising India positions itself as the voice of the Global South. These are all strategic moves.Plenty of regimes - both North and South - will not survive the climate-change crucible slated to grow worse for at least a half century more. The superpowers still standing on the far side of this environmental experiment will anchor North-South political unions that, in their combined demographic and economic strength, capably weathered this geopolitical storm.This future punishes states pursuing a going-it-alone strategy. The EU successfully adds stars to its flag not by conquest but attraction. These United States should do the same.(The author is Principal Business Strategist, Throughline Inc.

Azerbaijan, the host country, plans to urge nations to make concrete commitments at COP29, including doubling adaptation finance by 2025. Babayev emphasized innovative financing mechanisms and the need for accountability. COP29 aims to triple global renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030, with a focus on climate finance to support developing nations in emission reduction and climate resilience.",

        "articleBody": "The president of the next annual UN climate conference, Mukhtar Babayev, on Wednesday said that developing nations need nearly USD 6 trillion by 2030 to combat and adjust to climate change. The Azerbaijani environment minister also said that the host country will encourage nations to make concrete commitments at COP29, especially to double adaptation finance by 2025. He said that Azerbaijan is committed to reinforcing climate finance, with a particular emphasis on supporting developing countries, keeping in mind their needs  which approach nearly USD 6 trillion by 2030 . In an online address to a summit by The Energy and Resources Institute, Babayev said Azerbaijan will promote innovative financing mechanisms, including new private-public sector partnerships. This is important to ensure accountability and real progress, he noted. COP29 will also focus on building a clear and actionable roadmap to triple global renewable energy capacity and double the energy efficiency rate by 2030, he said. Climate finance will be the main focus of COP29 where nations have to set a new post-2025 target for raising funds to help developing nations cut emissions and handle the impacts of climate change. This is tough because rich nations have repeatedly failed in meeting their 2009 promise to raise USD 100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries. Simon Stiell, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in the Azerbaijani capital Baku last week that the world would need at least USD 2.4 trillion to keep within reach the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The G20 bloc last year said that developing countries will need USD 5.9 trillion in the pre-2030 period to implement their national climate plans effectively, with the aim of holding global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius. Earth's global surface temperature has risen by around 1.15 degrees Celsius as compared to pre-industrial levels (1850-1900), and the CO2 spewed into the atmosphere, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution, is closely tied to it. Climate science says the world needs to slash CO2 emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 to limit the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the guardrail to prevent worsening of climate impacts. The business-as-usual scenario will take the world to a temperature rise of around 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, scientists have warned.",

        "articleBody": "Sustainable finance is an idea that begun to pick up momentum after the global and national climate targets were announced under the Paris Agreement. Though the term \u2018sustainable development\u2019 was coined by the Brundtland Commission way back in 1987 in their landmark report \u2018Our Common Future\u201d, the progress on finding sustainable finance has been slower than expected. It is self-evident that greening of the economy or sustainable development in general cannot be achieved without changes in individual lifestyle and corporate behaviour. The corporate world tries to show its commitment to sustainability through investments linked to the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. Such investments are largely voluntary. It was expected that the ESG related investments would rise in quantum and scale after the declaration of near-term targets for emissions avoidance or reduction (2030) and the long-term goal for net zero by most large economies. Some optimists claim that the assets under management of ESG related investments will grow to a size of US$ 34 trillion in 2026 and constitute almost 21.5% of all such assets. The evidence, however, appears to be pointing to the contrary. In the US which constitutes over half of the global ESG investments market, growth has tapered. In India, a late starter in this field and has had a comparatively higher economic growth rate, reports indicate a marginal decline in such assets. This has happened despite the higher 2030 climate targets and the government\u2019s commitment to a long-term low emission development strategy. The irony is that even when the ESG-related funds were growing their impact on greening of economy was minimal. The emissions of all major economies and major corporate entities in the developed world are still very high, notwithstanding their tall claims about net zero. Their production and consumption patterns have hardly changed.Nowhere is it more evident than in those countries that are high on Human Development Index (HDI). For example, the Nordic countries continue to generate the highest per person municipal waste, almost 18 times that of India. The US with a per capita income 32 times that of India consumes three times more coal per person than India. Despite the very late start, renewable energy has a share of 18% in electricity generation in just ten years whereas US with its unlimited access to technologies and resources languishes at 22%.The conflicts raging in Europe and the Middle East have further lowered the appetite in the West for low carbon production and consumption. Slower economic growth is also a factor. The European Union\u2019s imposition of protective levies in form of border adjustment of carbon taxes from 2026 reflects this compulsion. All this is happening in the backdrop of ambitious declarations of commitment to net zero by the mid-century. It makes obvious that in a globalised world, no corporate entity or country wishes to surrender its access to low-cost energy and competitive advantage. It is moot as to what steps, under these circumstances, can be taken to change the production and consumption patterns and achieve a greener economy. The World Sustainable Development Summit 2024 organized by The Energy and Resources Institute this week in Delhi will try to look at some of these questions of sustainability. Three lessons are important in this connection. One, initial policy support from the government plays a critical role in filling the viability gap and orienting corporate investments to green sectors. Two, for green investments to be sustained in the long run, an uninterrupted flow of sustainable finance that addresses the climate risk is necessary. Three, sustainable finance is not only about disclosure of performance on sustainability norms; there is need of a formal mechanism for reducing the risk of green investments. Corporate reluctance to invest in low carbon and low return projects is understandable. Initial support is necessary to bridge the viability gap in such investments. This is precisely the objective of the US Inflation Reduction Act that extends subsidies and incentives to clean energy investments in the US. It also protects their industry from competitive pressures of international trade. India has experimented with large-scale government procurements as in case of LED bulbs or solar generation. The more recent Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme incentivizes investments in certain chosen sectors for greening the economy such as batteries, solar panels etc. However, there are limits to such efforts as public outlay is finite and there are competing needs.For a lasting impact, sustainable finance must be available at scale within the financial system itself. Attempts in this direction have so far aimed at increasing liquidity through ESG-linked or green bonds, evolving a uniform global standard for sustainability related disclosures for corporate and financial institutions, and aligning the financial flows from multilateral institutions such as the World bank, IFC and ADB with global sustainability norms. This approach is inadequate as it not only fails to meet the national priorities but leaves the crucial question of de-risking or lowering the risk of such investments unanswered. It may even result in a higher cost of capital for projects that do not meet the global norms. It is time that we seriously begin to find policy instruments to mitigate or reduce the physical and transition risks of climate and mandate the domestic financial system to rise to occasion. Such instruments would involve the regulators notifying a precise and consistent taxonomy for green investments while enabling systemic provisions for the risks to be covered.Rajani Ranjan Rashmi is a distinguished fellow and advisor to the World Sustainable Development Summit, TERI.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India plans to spend nearly 44% more on green projects and schemes in the next fiscal year using sovereign bond proceeds, a senior official said. This underscores the government's efforts to accelerate financing of clean energy projects, aimed at reducing the country's carbon footprint and contributing to its ambitious 2070 net zero emissions target.According to the expenditure plan prepared by the finance ministry for FY25, the government is looking to fund green projects and schemes worth \u20b932,062 crore, compared to \u20b922,324 crore this fiscal, the official told ET. The funding requirement has been prepared based on proposals submitted by various ministries.While the exact quantum of green bonds that will be issued in the next fiscal will be determined when the government finalises its borrowing calendar, given the higher funding needs, it may issue such papers worth \u20b925,000-30,000 crore in FY25, up from \u20b920,000 crore this year, the official said.107407463The estimated expenditure on green projects and schemes this fiscal is set to be \u20b92,324 crore higher than the money raised through these bonds. The government had initially pegged the green funding requirement for FY24 at \u20b923,764 crore. Given that the funds raised will have to be used strictly for green projects, the spending will be kept higher than the actual borrowing to assuage any apprehensions about potential misuse of such funds, officials told ET earlier.To be sure, the government's overall annual budgetary spending on green projects across sectors would far exceed this level. But such expenditures are not strictly segregated and classified as per the environment-friendly nature of the projects. However, since the government tapped green bonds for raising funds in FY23, it had to formally identify certain green projects to be funded by such proceeds.Fund deploymentNearly 47% of the green investments are proposed to be in railways in FY25, followed by projects in new and renewable energy (42%), housing and urban affairs (10%), environment and climate change (0.5%) and others, according to the expenditure plan firmed up for FY25. Railways, new and renewable energy, and housing and urban affairs had also accounted for the bulk of the expenditure funded through green bonds in FY23 and FY24. Most of the proposed funding requirement (\u20b912,000 crore) relates to the production of energy-efficient electric locomotives, followed by solar energy (\u20b9 10,000 crore).Economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth had on February 1 said, just like this fiscal, the green bond issue size for FY25 would feature in the Centre's overall market borrowing plan for the fiscal second half.",

For our tech-savvy youth, this will be a golden era. A corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore will be established with a 50-year interest-free loan. The corpus will provide long-term financing or refinancing with long tenors and low or nil interest rates,  said the Finance Minister.This will encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovation significantly in sunrise domains. We need to have programmes that combine the powers of our youth and technology,  she said.Lieutenant-General Dr SP Kochhar, Director General, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), said that the long-term, interest-free or low interest rate loans and focus on deep technology will  further encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovation. Ankur Bansal, Co-Founder and Director, BlackSoil Capital, said the move will encourage entrepreneurship. In addition, such initiatives will attract investment from the private sector and foreign investors, driving growth and propelling India towards self-reliance,  said Bansal.The Finance Minister said that a new scheme will be launched to strengthen the deep-tech sector for Defence purposes.Peeyush Vaish, Partner and TMT Industry Leader, Deloitte India, said that the large interest-free outlay will further boost our tech start-up ecosystem in emerging areas around 5G, generative AI, agritech and healthtech. The Rs 1 lakh crore corpus that will be made available with 50-year interest-free (long-term financing or refinancing) to encourage the private sector to scale up R&D in Sunrise domain is a welcome move for the sector. This will push India to the forefront of innovation and skill enhancement,  said Vaish.Neeraj Bansal, Co-Head and COO, India Global, KPMG in India, said the corpus will help in improving India's research and innovation ecosystem, critical to the country's aspirations of being a $5 trillion economy.The government will also expand and strengthen the EV ecosystem by supporting manufacturing and charging infrastructure.The focus on boosting EV charging stations will drive sales of both vehicles and charging infrastructure.Kanishk Maheshwari, Co-Founder & MD, Primus Partners, said that the new scheme for bio-manufacturing and biofoundry is a welcome step towards promoting sustainable and green manufacturing practices. It augurs well for both large and MSME units and should enable fast adoption of green manufacturing practices in the manufacturing process,  he said.India is making progress in building its EV charging infrastructure in order to phase out diesel vehicles in a stipulated time-frame but there is still a long way to go.Currently, the ratio of EVs to charging stations is nearly 9:1, while the ideal ratio should be 4:1, meaning four cars per one charging point.According to industry experts, most of the public charging stations are currently available in Tier 1 cities and some highways. However, for mass EV adoption to occur, charging infrastructure must be accessible throughout the country to encourage people to choose EVs for long-distance travel,  senior analyst Soumen Mandal from Counterpoint Research told IANS.India is likely to have 10,000 public charging stations by the end of 2025. Furthermore, in order to achieve a 30 per cent EV adoption rate, India must build more than 300,000 public charging stations by 2030,  Mandal said.Additionally, government initiatives like the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme further incentivise EV adoption.Another sunrise sector is clean energy, which promises a golden opportunity for companies to develop cutting-edge solutions to innovate further solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems.The industry hailed the government's latest push towards 'green growth' with a new scheme of bio-manufacturing and bio-foundry that will foster sustainable mobility.The Government said that such steps will provide environment-friendly alternatives such as biodegradable polymers, bio-plastics, bio-pharmaceuticals and bio-agri-inputs. This scheme will also help in transforming today's consumptive manufacturing paradigm to the one based on regenerative principles,  said Sitharaman.According to Neeraj Bansal the emphasis on green energy, announcement of rooftop solarisation and the fostering of the EV ecosystem underline the government's priority on sustainability.Mayank Bindal, Founder and CEO, Snap E Cabs (EV Cabs), said the announcement of a new scheme for bio-manufacturing  underscores the government's dedication to promoting green growth and environmental stewardship.  The government's continued focus on the EV ecosystem is indeed a pragmatic step forward and will continue to help India succeed in achieving its long-term decarbonisation objectives. This is an exciting time for the country's green industrial and economic transition,  said Manoj Nair, Head of India GDC, Fujitsu India.In order to achieve the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2070, there has been an emphasis on a green economy with focus on expansion of solar energy, bio fuels and charging infrastructure which will raise the need for green skills.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi today urged the industry to invest more in battery research and create batteries using raw materials available in India.PM Modi said that the demand for batteries will rise with an increase in solar rooftops, and there is a huge opportunity in the battery segment. While acknowledging research on sodium-based batteries, Modi urged the industry to create EV batteries using raw materials found in India. PM Modi said that cost and the battery are the biggest issues for the EV sector.Modi said that the Centre has announced an Rs 18,000 crore PLI scheme for battery storage.Modi also talked about his clean cooking plan at the expo. If I push the clean cooking movement, assuming there are 25 crore houses in the country, with rooftop and energy storage systems, we need 25 crore batteries for clean cooking. This will create a huge demand for batteries and reduce their prices,  he said.Highlighting the government's rooftop solar plan, Modi urged the industry to come up with a comprehensive plan.He said the government is aiming to create a decentralized system in which people can recharge their electric vehicles from the power they generate from rooftop solar systems.Modi said that the government has allocated Rs 3,200 crore to improve research and testing. The Prime Minister added that National Electric Mobility has given a new push to EV manufacturing. To increase demand for EVs, the government has allocated about Rs 10,000 crore, he added.Modi said that the FAME scheme was hugely successful, under which there were thousands of electric buses in Delhi and other cities.The government has even given subsidies for EV charging stations.To encourage research and innovation, the government announced a fund of Rs 1 lakh crore, he said. We have also given tax benefits for startups. All these will create more opportunities in the mobility segment, the PM hoped.According to him, 10 years ago, around 2,000 electric vehicles were being sold.Now 12 lakh electric vehicles are being sold. In the last 10 years, around 60 per cent growth has been registered in passenger vehicles, he added.",

There is a 7.57 per cent increase in funds for the mass rapid transit system and metro projects in comparison to the last year's allocation of Rs 23,175 crore.  In the interim Budget presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Rs 26,170 crore has been set aside for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) -- an increase of 4.3 per cent.  107315613 The Prime Minister Street Vendor's AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi), a micro-credit scheme that provides collateral-free working capital loans of up to Rs 50,000 to street vendors, has been allocated Rs 326 crore against Rs 468 crore in the last Union Budget.  The Smart Cities Mission received Rs 2,400 crore in the interim Budget while it had been allocated Rs 8,000 crore in the 2023-24 General Budget. The period of the mission is scheduled to end in June this year.  The Swachh Bharat Mission, another flagship programme of the Modi government, has been given Rs 5,000 crore.  107323717 The government has proposed to allocate Rs 1,300 crore to procure electric buses under the PM-eBus Sewa scheme. Under the scheme, 10,000 electric buses will be provided to 169 cities under the public-private partnership model.  Last month, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the government has floated tenders for procuring e-buses under the scheme. The scheme, which will continue till 2037, will have an outlay of Rs 57,613 crore, of which Rs 20,000 crore will be provided by the Centre and the rest will be borne by the states.  While presenting the interim Budget, Sitharaman said that rapid urbanisation is taking place in the country, asserting that metro rail and NaMo Bharat trains can be catalysts for the required urban transformation.  107289936 She said expansion of these systems will be supported in large cities focusing on transit-oriented development.  In October last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the country's first Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS). It was named NaMo Bharat train.   We have a fast-expanding middle class and rapid urbanisation is taking place,  Sitharaman said.  According to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, one crore passengers ride metro systems per day in the country.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: In an effort to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, India will solarise rooftops of one crore households and provide viability gap funding for harnessing offshore wind energy potential with an initial capacity of one gigawatt, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday. Presenting the interim budget for 2024-25, she also said that the government will mandate the phased blending of compressed biogas (CBG) in compressed natural gas (CNG) for transport and natural gas (PNG) for domestic purposes. The finance minister emphasised that the government would enable one crore households to obtain up to 300 units of free electricity every month through the rooftop solar programme. This will result in savings of up to Rs 18,000 annually for households from free solar electricity and selling the surplus to distribution companies, Sitharaman said. According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water (CEEW), 20-25 gigawatts of rooftop solar capacity could be supported through the solarisation of one crore households. With a coastline of about 7,600 km (mainland), India has a good potential for offshore wind energy generation. The initial assessment of offshore wind energy potential within identified zones has been estimated to be about 70 gigawatt off the coast of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. India stands fourth globally in renewable energy installed capacity, fourth in wind power capacity and fifth in solar power capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency's Renewable Capacity Statistics 2023. The fast-growing South Asian nation will also set up coal gasification and liquefaction capacity of 100 MT by 2030, aiming to reduce imports of natural gas, methanol, and ammonia. The finance minister said that financial assistance would be provided for the procurement of biomass aggregation machinery to support collection. The government will expand and strengthen the e-vehicle ecosystem by supporting manufacturing and charging infrastructure. Greater adoption of e-buses for public transport networks will be encouraged through the payment security mechanism. India will also launch a new scheme of bio-manufacturing and bio-foundry to provide environmentally friendly alternatives such as biodegradable polymers, bioplastics, biopharmaceuticals and bio-agri inputs, Sitharaman said.  This scheme will also help in transforming today's consumptive manufacturing paradigm to the one based on regenerative principles,  she said. Under Blue Economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, coastal aquaculture and mariculture with an integrated and multi-sectoral approach will be launched. The government has provided 10 crore LPG connections under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana in the last 10 years. In an effort to promote electrical efficiency, 36.9 crore LED bulbs, 72.2 lakh LED tube lights, and 23.6 lakh energy-efficient fans have been distributed under the UJALA scheme, and 1.3 crore LED streetlights have been installed under the Street Light National Programme. India has committed to achieving net-zero emissions (a balance between greenhouse gases emitted and removed from the atmosphere) by 2070 and 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. According to India's third national communication submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2023, the country reduced its GDP emission intensity by 33 per cent between 2005 and 2019, achieving the target 11 years in advance. The country aims to reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45 per cent by 2030. The energy sector accounted for the maximum share of anthropogenic emissions (75.81 per cent), followed by agriculture (13.44 per cent), Industrial Process and Product Use (8.41 per cent) and waste (2.34 per cent), according to the document. Climate and clean energy experts said the budget has got a significant focus on green economic push and climate investments. The solarisation of rooftops will give a massive boost to energy access and decentralised clean solar energy, while the viability gap funding for offshore wind (projects) will change the game for wind energy and help in utilising India's long coastline, said Dhruba Purkayastha, India Director, Climate Policy Initiative. Coal gasification, while controversial, can be a game changer for India's energy security amid the Global North's push for gas as a transitional fuel. India has abundant coal reserves which if gasified can produce a near equivalent to natural gas, he said. The phased mandatory blending of compressed biogas with compressed natural gas for transport and PNG purposes, is a well thought through strategy to clean the coal gasified gas, Purkayastha said. Vice President-India, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), Saurabh Kumar said the rooftop solar scheme marks a significant milestone for scaling-up India's clean energy ambitions. The push for an EV ecosystem creation and the large-scale roll-out of e-buses through payment security mechanisms will decarbonise the mobility sector while propelling India as a potential EV manufacturing hub, he said and added that the announcement of a Rs 1 lakh crore corpus is a remarkable step to attract private investment in innovation, research and development in the clean energy sector. Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, said incentivising individuals to save up to Rs 15,000-Rs 18,000 by selling surplus rooftop solar electricity to distribution companies will not only generate income but add up to put India in a strong position of climate leadership ahead of the COP33.",

        "articleBody": "The Budget's financial assistance measure for procurement of biomass aggregation machinery to facilitate biogas production will establish the missing link between entrepreneurs and the sector.A major impediment for thousands of entrepreneurs who could not raise funds to set up compressed bio gas (CBG) operations, this measure will pave the way to greenfield capacity addition and help meet the mandate to blend, in phases, compressed biogas (CBG) with piped gas supplied to households and CNG for the transport sector.In addition to meeting the country's burgeoning natural gas demand, the measure will also lower the liquefied natural gas (LNG) import bill.CBG plants based on biomass or parali are expensive because of the post-harvest supply chain management which involves cutting, treading, raking, bailing, transportation, and warehousing in 35-40 days before the next sowing season begins. Funding is required for equipment, transportation, and storage.With an allocation of Rs. 564.75 crore from FY 2023-24 to FY 2026-27, with subsidy capped at 50% of procurement cost, the scheme will help CBG producers buy biomass machinery, aiding biomass collection for CBG. The scheme is expected to support 100 CNG plants in the first phase, thus enabling the setting up of an assured biomass supply chain. The cost of setting up a 100- tonne-per-day capacity CBG plant based on paddy straw is Rs 80 crore.The Finance Minister said that to promote green growth, a new scheme of bio-manufacturing and bio-foundry will also be launched. This will provide environment-friendly alternatives such as biodegradable polymers, bio-plastics, bio-pharmaceuticals, and bio-agri-inputs. This scheme will also help in transforming today\u2019s consumptive manufacturing paradigm to one based on regenerative principles.Simply put, biodegradable polymers and bio plastics are made from materials that can be decomposed in a few days by the action of micro-organisms. These products will not only help address the problem of plastic usage, plastic pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions but also encourage entrepreneurship and employment. Using bio-agri inputs will not only help reduce carbon footprint but also improve soil and water health and promote sustainable agriculture.",

        "articleBody": "The Indian power sector is now at a critical juncture. On the one hand we must meet the growing energy needs of the country, and on the other hand fulfill the ambitious energy transition-related goals. Although the government must be commended for undertaking various initiatives and bringing substantive improvements in the sector viz. reduction in receivables, streamlining award of projects and honouring of contracts, adding more PSUs as REIA viz. NHPC, SJVN, rollout of AMI implementation under RDSS scheme etc., more needs to be done in this regard.There is an urgent need to increase RE capacity addition from the present level of 15 GW per year to 50 GW per year, along with a tripling of investments. The upcoming Union Budget 2024 is an opportune time to make suitable provisions for increasing the investment appetite in the sector. Our expectations are as follows:Scaling up finance: Measures like allocation of higher loan capital towards RE in PSBs, additional capitalisation in organisations like IREDA, raising capital through tax saving renewable bonds, suitable regulatory framework for attracting insurance firms and pension funds, providing regulatory certainty and procedural ease for InVIT and AIFs, will increase the availability of finances for RE projects.Relaxing norms for improving investment climate: Presently, RE projects are developed through Holding Company-SPV route. Some relaxation of norms such as the exemption of holding company from being recognised as NBFC/CIC, exemption of corporate tax on dividends received by holding co for re-investment into RE assets, consolidated tax filing at group level instead of individual SPV level, will improve the investment climate.Streamlining land acquisition process and Right of Way (RoW) issues: As land acquisition and RoW issues often delay RE projects, there could be merit in creating a suitable mechanism through a land bank and streamlining land acquisition process for faster execution.Viability Gap Funding for Battery Energy Storage Systems: Absorption of high RE requires utility scale battery storage solutions. Presently, it is unviable due to high costs. The government may provide support through VGF to battery storage systems till it achieves scale and reduction in cost. Similarly, capital subsidy may be considered for promoting pumped storage projects, which has a higher capex compared to battery storage, but offers much better life and utility.Capital Subsidy for Smart Grid implementation and other technologies: Smart and robust grid is needed for bringing flexibility to the demand and supply. While the capital subsidy for AMI implementation should be continued, the scope may be enhanced by including in its ambit implementation of other technological solutions including decision support system, AI etc. necessary for improving discoms' operational efficiency and strengthening of the grid for integration of renewables.Reduction in Taxes & Duties for promoting domestic manufacturing: Extending the concessional corporate tax of 15% to new domestic manufacturing companies till March 2027 and making it applicable for green hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives business is recommended. GST rates can also be reduced to 5% for manufacturing of green hydrogen, electrolysers, and solar modules. The custom duty on solar cells may also be reduced to foster domestic manufacturing.Boosting R&D and capacity building: As the advent of renewables has made the power sector very dynamic, the government could consider promoting R&D and bring innovation in technologies such as battery, green hydrogen, and smart grid. There is also a need for continuous capacity building to be able to handle newer developments taking place in the sector.The author is managing director, Apraava Energy",

This scheme is meant to help poor and middle-income households lower their electricity bills. Government\u2019s previous rooftop solar programme In 2014, the government initiated the Rooftop Solar Programme with the goal of attaining a total installed capacity of 40,000 megawatts (MW) or 40 gigawatts (GW) by 2022. A watt, a unit of power, is determined as the quantity of energy utilized over time, specifically one Joule per second.Here are some important FAQs about the benefits and usage of the rooftop solar programme, as per the government\u2019s website. What are the advantages of Grid-Connected Rooftop Solar System?\u2022 Saving on electricity bill by the consumer.\u2022 Utilization of available vacant roof space, no additional land required.\u2022 Low gestation period.\u2022 No additional requirement of transmission and distribution (T&D) lines.\u2022 Reduces T&D losses as power consumption and generation are collocated.\u2022 Improvement in the tail-end grid voltages and reduction of system congestion.\u2022 Long term energy and ecological security by reduction in carbon emission.\u2022 Better management of daytime peak loads by DISCOM/ utility.\u2022 Meeting of the Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) of obligated entities.Can I make my monthly electricity bill \u2018zero\u2019 by installing RTS?This is possible in very rare cases because the consumer shall be required to pay some minimum charges like fixed charges, etc. even if the consumed energy is all selfgenerated. However, \u2018electricity charges\u2019, a major component of the monthly bill, can be reduced to zero by optimally designing and maintaining the RTS. The monthly electricity bill may come to zero in States which give revenue for surplus power generated.What is the general procedure for installation of Rooftop Solar system for beneficiary?The interested beneficiary may install the solar rooftop systems through project developers/system integrators/manufactures etc. after taking necessary approval from DISCOMs within the capacity limit as laid down in the order of respective State Electricity Regulatory Commission/Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission of the respective States/UTs.",

        "articleBody": "India is striving to establish reliable lithium supply to bolster its growing electric vehicle (EV) industry with its recent INR 200 crore investment in lithium exploration in Argentina by the Ministry of Mines. Despite these efforts, industry experts caution that the nation's lithium mining and processing sector is essentially starting from scratch, with limited immediate impact expected from the latest developments.Currently, India imports 100% of its lithium, with a significant portion (over 95%) sourced from China and Hong Kong. The joint venture Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL), involving NALCO, HCL, and MECL, has secured exploration rights in Argentina, adding to previous agreements with Australia for lithium and cobalt exploration. However, the lithium industry faces a prolonged gestation period, averaging 6 to 7 years from discovery to production in South American brine assets, as per the International Energy Agency (IEA).Ritabrata Ghosh, Vice President - Corporate Ratings & Sector Head at ICRA, emphasizes that China currently dominates 65% of the lithium processing/ refining industry, an area where India lacks a foothold. He notes,  There are two parts to it: mining and processing, two separate activities that need to be individually focused on and developed. Argentina has brine deposits, for which the extraction and processing technology is well proven. However, one thing is certain: the path to commercializing these assets can be long due to India's limited expertise in lithium mining and India\u2019s limited track record of successfully developing mining assets in a foreign country due to elevated execution risks.  Globally, lithium is found in brine deposits, hard rock deposits, and clay deposits. Regarding the discovery of 5.9 million tonnes of lithium bearing minerals in Jammu and Kashmir, Ghosh highlights the challenges: \u201cIndia's lithium reserves found in J&K are of clay deposits, a type where commercialization has not been proven globally as yet. While U.S. companies like Lithium Americas are on the brink of commercializing lithium mining from clay deposits in the Nevada valley, assets like Thacker Pass are not expected to come onstream before CY2026. Therefore, the path to commercialization of the J&K lithium mine could well be quite long\u201d.While the J&K mine has been explored at G3 level, in Chhattisgarh, the second lithium deposit at the Katghora that has been put up for auction, is at a more nascent G4 exploration level. However, here, the lithium bearing mineral is in the form of pegmatite or hard rock, where the extraction and processing technology is commercially proven . Despite lower technological challenges here than lithium extraction from clay, detailed exploration will be required to establish the ore characteristics, and therefore production is not expected from the Chhattisgarh block in the medium term.Ghosh also raised questions about the additional challenges in commercial viability of the lithium mining from clay in the J&K block. He points out,  Compared to similar ongoing clay mining assets like Thacker Pass in the USA, having resources of 19.1 million tonne of a lithium carbon equivalent (LCE), the ore body discovered in J&K is estimated to have a significantly smaller lithium resources of ~0.02 million tonnes of LCE, indicating a minimal extractable quantity. This raises the second question of whether such a small ore body can be commercially mined. To expedite the process, Ghosh believes that attracting foreign companies with lithium mining and processing expertise to invest in India will be crucial to accelerate the domestic lithium exploration and mining activities. Government incentives and amendments to mining regulations aim to improve the ease-of-doing business and foster a business-friendly ecosystem, but challenges persist due to the lengthy gestation period and technology concentration in China.In the short to medium term, India is expected to continue import dependencies. Collaboration with foreign experts and partnerships with experienced companies in lithium processing technologies are seen as crucial steps. The government's tools, including the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI), may play a pivotal role in incentivizing investments and fostering growth in the critical minerals sector.While progress has been made in removing lithium from the atomic mineral list and incentivizing exploration, achieving self-sufficiency in lithium will require years and decades of sustained efforts.Untitled Carousel 106885751 106873215 106961070 106986970",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, State-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) on Thursday said it has inked five initial pacts with partners to boost energy efficiency and renewables in the country, aligning with G20 and COP28 commitments. These initiatives are poised to double energy efficiency and triple renewable energy, in line with the ambitious targets set at COP28 and G20, an Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) statement said. According to the statement, EESL, a joint venture of public sector undertakings under the administration of the Ministry of Power, has signed memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with strategic partner organisations. EESL Chief Executive Officer Vishal Kapoor said,  The commitment we are making through these MoUs is crucial for not only support in meeting our Nationally Determined Contributions but also for contributing to the global effort in achieving the goals set at COP28 . Collaborations like these are crucial imperatives for us to actively contribute to the goal of doubling the rate of energy efficiency and tripling the rate of renewable energy, he stated. India has made significant progress in these sectors. As the nation climbs the socio-economic ladder, it will be pivotal for our business models to be people-oriented, he said. Energy efficiency has rightly been called the first fuel, and the only way to amplify its impact is by making it available to people at the bottom of the pyramid, he pointed out. Erik Solheim, former under-secretary general of the United Nations and former minister of Environment and International Cooperation, Norway, said,  The world has moved from the choice of environment or development to environment and development. Asia is the driving force of global economic growth and also leading the world in the space of renewable energy and energy efficiency . Through collaborative efforts, EESL is forging impactful partnerships with leading organisations to drive sustainable energy solutions and climate action. Under the MoU with Green TERRE Foundation EESL collaborated with the foundation to propel a movement 'U75: Net-Zero University Campus'. Seventy-five educational institutes join the initiative to transform campuses into carbon-neutral hubs, advancing energy efficiency and clean energy. This movement not only aims for local impact but also catalyses India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Under the MoU with TERI for partnership development, both entities join forces to identify collaboration areas in energy efficiency and clean energy. The partnership encompasses prioritising policies, technical studies, large-scale program implementation, and training. This collaboration focuses on capacity building, knowledge product development, and joint fundraising proposals, emphasising coordination activities for effective implementation. Under the MoU with Hindware Ltd, it will implement energy efficiency measures at Hindware facilities. The collaboration centres on achieving energy savings, creating awareness, and contributing to sustainability and decarbonisation. This partnership underscores the mutual commitment to work together on common goals related to energy efficiency services. Under the MoU with C K Birla Group of Companies, EESL partners with Orient Paper and Industries Limited and Orient Cement Limited for energy efficiency and clean energy initiatives. The collaboration includes the implementation of energy-efficient technologies identified under the Demonstration of Energy Efficiency Project (DEEP) and other energy-efficiency projects. The focus extends to capacity building, technical studies, and coordination activities for effective project execution. Under the MoU with GGGI and HAREDA on the ALCBT Project, the entities will embark on the Asia Low Carbon Buildings Transition (ALCBT) project under the Indo-German Energy Programme. This initiative aims to assess and align project objectives with Haryana's climate action priorities, map state-level agencies, develop an enabling ecosystem through policy measures, and strengthen institutional capacity for scaling up low-carbon buildings. ALCBT has signed a similar MoU with MCA Kerela. These strategic collaborations reaffirm EESL's commitment to driving sustainable energy solutions, fostering environmental stewardship, and contributing to a resilient, low-carbon future, the statement said.",

        "articleBody": "The government may look for providing incentives or supporting initiatives to retrofit old vehicles into electric vehicles instead of scrapping them, a report said on Thursday. According to the joint report by management consultancy firm Primus Partners and ETB (European Business and Technology Centre), transitioning the internal combustion engine-powered vehicles to electric vehicles through retrofitting presents a spectrum of challenges.  However, with a coordinated approach involving government initiatives, industry collaboration, and public engagement, these challenges can be effectively addressed and overcome, it said.  India's Vehicle Scrappage Policy is aimed at phasing out old and unfit vehicles and replacing them with newer and more environment-friendly ones.  This policy is governed by various factors including the fitness and emission levels of vehicles rather than solely their age.  Commercial vehicles over 15 years and passenger vehicles over 20 years of age are subject to increased re-registration fees or scrapping under this policy.   Instead of scrapping old vehicles, the government could provide incentives or support initiatives to retrofit old vehicles to run on electric power. This way, the lifespan of existing vehicles is extended,  the joint report said.  Moreover, retrofitting could also offer a pathway to modernising the existing vehicle fleet, while simultaneously reducing emissions and aligning with the broader sustainability goals of a circular economy, said the report titled 'Retrofit for a greener future: Accelerating electric vehicle adoption'.  Emphasising that retrofitting is more than a temporary solution, the report said it is a significant step towards sustainable mobility, demonstrating a commitment to environmental stewardship.  As of 2023, the global retrofit vehicle market is estimated at USD 65.94 billion and projected to reach USD 125.37 billion by 2032 with a compounded annual growth rate of 7.40 per cent, as per the report.  Noting that retrofitting generally offers a quicker ROI (return on investment) across all vehicle types compared to purchasing new EVs, the report said that in the case of medium-duty trucks, the break-even point for retrofitting is achieved in approximately five years, compared to about 8 years for new electric vehicles.  This faster attainment of break-even is influenced by the substantial annual fuel savings, which contribute significantly to recouping the retrofitting costs, it said.  Similarly, for buses, the break-even for retrofitted electric vehicles is reached in around four years, which is notably quicker than the eight years required for new electric vehicles, as per the report.  As India strides forward in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and its own nationally determined contributions (NDCs), fostering a robust EV retrofitting ecosystem becomes pivotal. Market analysis suggests that the retrofitting sector is currently in its infancy. It exhibits significant potential for expansion due to technological simplicity and accessibility, the report said.",

        "articleBody": "More than 20 ministers and CEOs from various countries including India on Wednesday joined a World Economic Forum alliance to unlock an estimated USD 2.2-2.8 trillion needed for the Global South's clean energy transition. Announcing the launch of the alliance at its Annual Meeting 2024, the WEF said it will provide a platform for developing economies to raise awareness about their clean energy needs, share best practices and sustainably accelerate their energy transitions.  The Network to Mobilize Clean Energy Investment for the Global South is made up of over 20 CEOs and government ministers, including from across Colombia, Egypt, India, Japan, Malaysia, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Norway, Kenya and South Africa.  The Forum also released a new report, Building Trust through an Equitable and Inclusive Energy Transition, that outlines a framework to guide policy-makers and business leaders from the energy sector towards a just, equitable and inclusive energy transition, particularly in developing economies, which account for less than one-fifth of global clean energy investments.  The overall annual investment in clean energy in the Global South needs to triple from USD 770 billion currently to USD 2.2-2.8 trillion by the early 2030s, it said.  While recent spending has increased, the report finds that it remains concentrated in a few countries and sectors, with over 90 per cent of investment growth having occurred in advanced economies and China since 2021.  In recent years, emerging economies like China and India have demonstrated their ability to rapidly adopt and even lead in new energy technologies and value chains, the report said.  India has substantially expanded its renewable energy capacity and made advancements in clean hydrogen.  To reduce uncertainties associated with these technologies, facilitate their widespread adoption and foster further innovation, it is imperative to strengthen international cooperation, promote knowledge sharing among stakeholders and adapt solutions to local contexts and priorities, the WEF said.  It also said that countries like India, Brazil and parts of the Middle East have seen an increase in clean energy investments and projects, progress has been slower in many other emerging and developing economies, particularly in investments aimed at expanding and modernizing grids.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: A whopping investment of Rs 17.05 lakh crore is in the pipeline in power and renewable energy sector, which has attracted around 16.93 lakh crore of investment since 2014, Union minister R K Singh said on Monday. As much as 80 GW of thermal power generation capacity is under construction which we will have by 2030, Singh told reporters, adding that about 99 GW of renewable energy is under construction, at present.  Briefing reporters on new rules called Electricity (Amendment) Rules 2024, Singh said that as much as Rs 16.93 lakh crore has been invested in power and renewable energy sectors so far.  The Rs 16.93 lakh crore investment includes Rs 11.2 lakh crore in sectors like generation, distribution and transmission while Rs 5.73 lakh crore in the renewable energy sector, the minister explained.  He further stated that an investment of Rs 17.05 lakh crore is in the pipeline in the power and renewable energy sectors.  The minister said that Rs 7.4 lakh crore would be invested in the power sector while Rs 9.65 lakh crore.  He also said that India's power generation capacity will increase to over 800GW from about 428 GW at present. India has planned to bid out 50GW of renewable energy projects every year.  About the new rules, the ministry said consumers, having more than a specified quantum of load and Energy Storage Systems (ESS), are now allowed to establish, operate and maintain dedicated transmission lines themselves without the requirement of a licence.  By allowing such a facility a new category of Bulk Consumers would emerge in the country, benefiting from more affordable electricity and enhanced grid reliability, it stated.  This facility was already available to generating companies and captive generating stations.  For ease of doing business by industries like Green Hydrogen manufacturers and to facilitate energy transition along with energy security by faster establishment of energy storage capacity new rules have been prescribed.  The new rules facilitate bulk consumers and energy storage systems (of not less than 25MW), to get connected to the Grid easily and at a faster pace.  They shall not be required to obtain a licence for establishing, operating or maintaining a dedicated transmission line to connect to the grid.  The new rules also provide that consumers including industry will benefit in terms of getting electricity at competitive rates by ensuring that open access charges are reasonable.  To rationalise the open access charges new rules have been prescribed with methodologies for determining various open access charges like wheeling charges, state transmission charges and additional surcharges.  The rule inter-alia prescribes that for a person availing of General Network Access or Open Access, the additional surcharge shall be linearly reduced and get eliminated within four years from the date of grant of General Network Access or Open Access.  It is also provided that the additional surcharge shall be applicable only for the Open Access Consumers who are or have been consumers of the concerned Distribution licensee.  Thus, a person who has never been a consumer of the Distribution licensee would not have to pay an additional surcharge.  The rules also improve financial health of discoms by ensuring cost-reflective tariff through elimination of revenue gap.  To ensure financial sustainability of the power sector, it is necessary that the tariff is cost reflective and all the prudent costs are allowed.  However, it explained that some States Regulators had created a large revenue gap leading to financial distress to the distribution companies due to disallowance of various costs incurred including even power purchases costs.  To discourage such practice, there was a need to make statutory provisions to ensure that there is no such gap, it pointed out.  It is also imperative that liquidation of any such existing gaps in revenue is done in a time bound manner.  New rules are notified to ensure that revenue gap is not created except in extraordinary circumstances like natural calamity and to provide for time bound liquidation of the gaps created, if any.  The rule mandates that the tariff shall be cost reflective and there shall not be any gap between approved Annual Revenue Requirement and estimated annual revenue from approved tariff except under natural calamity conditions.  Such gap, created if any, shall not be more than three percent of the approved Annual Revenue Requirement, it stated.  The rule also provides that such gap along with the carrying costs at the base rate of Late Payment Surcharge as specified in the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022, shall be liquidated in maximum three numbers of equal yearly instalments from the next financial year.  For a revenue gap existing at the time of promulgation of the rules, it is mandated that any such gap, on the date of notification of these rules, along with the carrying costs at the base rate of Late Payment Surcharge as specified in the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022, shall be liquidated in maximum seven numbers of equal yearly instalments starting from the next financial year.  Releasing the Rules, Singh stated that the steps taken by the government had already brought down the losses of the distribution companies from 27 per cent in 2014 to 15.41 per cent in 2022-23.  The doing away with the requirement of licence for dedicated transmission lines for industry will lead to ease of doing business for the industry, leading to faster industrial growth and more job creation, the minister stated.",

The operation of electric buses will be initiated on the Dharma Path and Ram Path. 100 electric buses will commence operations from January 15 onward in the city. Ayodhya regional transport officer, Ritu Singh said  We are trying our best to provide clean transportation facilities. With the initiative of the honourable Chief Minister, the city is going to get electric buses. Ayodhya City Bus Transportation Ltd has been formed for the same.  We will provide the electric bus service to all our VVIP guests invited on January 22. We are also trying our best to promote CNG autos, tempos, taxis, etc. in the city,  the RTO said. Ritu Singh highlighted the importance of drivers in providing a memorable journey in Ayodhya and emphasised the initiatives taken to well-train all the drivers in the city. Under the initiative of 'Mera Chalak, Mera Mann', we are sanitising the drivers. When people from outside come to Ayodhya, they get introduced to the drivers first. We want them to carry a good image of our city. We are grooming drivers for the same,  she said.  Transport associations have been guided to not demand beyond divided fares. Commercial vehicle drivers must be properly uniformed  the RTO added further. Ritu Singh elaborated on state initiatives to promote CNG vehicles in the city.  E-autos have also been introduced, registration for which is under process. Very soon, Ayodhya will get e-auto service. Manoj Kumar Yadav, an electric bus driver said  I feel very happy that I could come to Ayodhya from Lucknow. Everybody travelling in an e-bus is full of joy.  Electric buses don't emit pollution and these buses are fully air conditioned. The city of Ayodhya is decorated well for the upcoming event , said Sharjah Alam, another e-bus driver.Ayodhya will be seamlessly connected through transportation facilities. On the Chaudah Kosi and Panchkosi Parikrama routes, new areas have been marked at Udaya Chowk. Parking lots will be developed there, covering 70 acres (10 acres, 35 acres, and 25 acres).Ram Path and Dharma Path are two of the four main paths in Ayodhya. The other two paths are Bhakti Path and Janmabhoomi Path.The four paths are based on the concepts of the four Vedas and four eras. The Uttar Pradesh government is planning to run electric buses on Ram Path and Dharma Path to provide facilities for tourists and pilgrims. The 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony will be held over seven days starting on January 16. On January 16, the host appointed by the temple trust, Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra, will conduct the atonement ceremony. The 'Dashvidh' bath, Vishnu worship, and offering to cows will be held on the banks of the Saryu River. ",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Delhi government's transport department has once again floated a tender for deploying electric scooters in the Dwarka sub-city to strengthen last-mile connectivity in the area, officials said. The government plans to deploy thousands of electric scooters at around 90 locations in Dwarka, they added.  Bids floated for high speed and low speed scooters for first and last mile connectivity with bus stops and metro stations in Dwarka sub city,  Delhi Transport Commissioner Ashish Kundra said in a post on 'X' on Thursday. Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot told PTI that proposals have been invited from potential service providers for the deployment of high-speed e-scooters and low-speed e-scooters.  This move is to encourage last-mile connectivity in Dwarka. Subsequently, we will implement it in other areas too. This is the second time that the tender is being floated,  he added. A senior transport department official said the bids have been floated for the second time since there were no bidders in the first round. A pre-bid meeting will be held later this month to understand the market. This time, the bid conditions have been modified. He also said that this time, they have invited bids for electric scooters only and not cycles. Under this, 3,000 electric vehicles will be deployed at 90 high-footfall locations, such as metro stations, bus depots, markets, malls and educational institutions in three phases. Phase 1 will be launched with 1,500 vehicles, and they will include high-speed e-scooters and low-speed e-scooters. Phase 2 will introduce an additional minimum of 750 vehicles, while Phase 3 will complete the deployment of the remaining 750 vehicles, with the condition that they be offered for long-term hiring or rental. Bidders will have the flexibility to operate different EV variants based on demand, he said. Phase 1 of the project is to be implemented in six months, Phase 2 in four months and Phase 3 in another four months, followed by seven years for operations and maintenance. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 18 crore.",

        "articleBody": "Gandhinagar: India is looking to achieve the target of 50 per cent of its total power capacity coming from renewable energy ahead of its stated timeline of 2030, a senior government official said on Friday. Out of a total capacity target of 500 gigawatt from non-fossil sources, 485 gigawatt is being envisaged to come from renewable energy (RE), Secretary at the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said.  Speaking at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit here, he said,  Our share of renewable energyinin the total energy has increased substantially. Now it's over 42 per cent of India's total energy capacity and that is significant.   He further said,  We are committed to achieve 50 per cent of the capacity by 2030 and we are on path to achieve that and we hope to do that much earlier than 2030.   Bhalla said India's RE capacity has increased from about 76 gigawatts in 2014 to 180 gigawatts at present.   The target is of 500 gigawatt of non-fossil capacity, out of which we will have about 485 gigawatt of RE by 2030,  he said.  While 180 gigawatt of RE capacity is already functional, another 175 gigawatt is under implementation.   That shows the scale at which India is progressing. Majority of it will come on board. It maybe a little delayed at some time but most of the projects are supposed to come online and we expect that to happen,  he added.  Bhalla acknowledged that the gap between the targeted total capacity of RE and the combine of existing and upcoming capacities needs to be covered and has to be planned and executed.",

        "articleBody": "The world added 50 percent more renewable energy capacity in 2023 over the previous year but more is needed in the battle against climate change, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.The increase was the fastest growth rate in the past two decades and the 22nd year in a row that renewable capacity additions set a new record, the Paris-based IEA said.The rise was driven by China, the planet's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases but also what the IEA called  the world's renewables powerhouse .Massively scaling up the deployment of solar and wind power while winding down the use of fossil fuels is crucial to achieving the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.But the world is not on pace to reach the goal of tripling renewable capacity by 2030, a target agreed by nearly 200 nations at the UN's COP28 climate summit in Dubai last month, the IEA said.The COP28 agreement also called for  transitioning away  from fossil fuels, but without setting a timeline and short of a  phase-out  demanded by many nations but opposed by oil giant Saudi Arabia.Global renewable capacity is expected to increase 2.5 times from 2022 levels by the end of the decade, the agency's annual report on the sector found. It's not enough yet to reach the COP28 goal of tripling renewables, but we're moving closer -- and governments have the tools needed to close the gap,  IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.Birol said onshore wind and solar panels were less expensive now than fossil fuel plants in most countries. The most important challenge for the international community is rapidly scaling up financing and deployment of renewables in most emerging and developing economies,  he said. Success in meeting the tripling goal will hinge on this,  Birol added.All-time highs The agency, which advises developed countries on energy policy, said renewable capacity reached almost 510 gigawatts last year, with solar photovoltaics (PV) accounting for three-quarters of additions worldwide.China commissioned as much solar PV last year as the entire world did in 2022, while the country's wind power additions rose by 66 percent year-on-year.Increases in Europe, the United States and Brazil  also hit all-time highs , the energy watchdog said.Prices for solar PV devices fell by 50 percent in 2023 compared to the previous year.The IEA said costs are expected to fall further as global manufacturing capacity is forecast to significantly exceed demand by the end of 2024.The wind industry, however, is facing  a more challenging environment due to a combination of ongoing supply chain disruption, higher costs and long permitting timelines , the report said.Not fast enoughDave Jones, global insights programme director at the Ember think tank, said the sector's 2023 growth  makes it clear that a tripling of renewables is entirely achievable . We are increasingly on track not only for a peaking of fossil fuel use this decade, but for sizable falls in fossil fuel use,  Jones said. 2024 will be the year that renewables changed from a nuisance for the fossil fuel industry, to an existential threat,  he added.Dean Cooper, global energy lead at conservation group WWF, said renewable energy generation was increasing  fast but not fast enough . We will not avert climate catastrophe while fossil fuels continue to be burned,  he said.  Those who want to see a liveable planet should increase pressure on their government to convert words into action by demanding they urgently transform their energy systems,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The government is working on a plan to build electric vehicle-ready highways on the Golden Quadrilateral in a major effort towards reducing fuel consumption and vehicular emissions through electrification of intercity public transport. People in the know told ET that the Centre is looking to develop 6,000 km of these highways. This is planned over the next seven years to accelerate the adoption of e-mobility and support the deployment of e-buses across the country. These e-highways would be powered with green energy-enabled charging infrastructure.The programme is being envisaged as part of the proposed Vision 2030: PM Public Transport Sewa. The development of electric highways is likely to happen simultaneously with induction of electric buses accelerating the establishment of an ecosystem for EVs in India,  said one of the persons cited above.The government has initiated talks with stakeholders to replace 800,000 old, polluting diesel buses with electric ones by 2030. This includes 200,000 electric buses for state transport undertakings, 550,000 for private operators and 50,000 for schools and employee transportation.The new e-highways are expected to catalyse the development of charging infrastructure, spurring more people to buy electric cars for everyday commutes. Sales of electric cars last year stood at 83,000 units, shy of the targeted 100,000 mark, as first-time buyers kept away from electric as the only option for their choice of vehicle. Consumers are sceptical of the range and the inadequate charging infrastructure for EVs in the country, making them opt for such vehicles only as a second or third personal mode of transport.The Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) is the longest highway network in the country connecting the four metros of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai - and along with them several industrial, agricultural and cultural hubs. The North-South Corridor connecting Srinagar (in Jammu & Kashmir) and Kanyakumari (in Tamil Nadu) and the East-West Corridor connecting Silchar (in Assam) to Porbandar (in Gujarat) are additional projects. The development of e-highways on the GQ is likely to give a significant boost to the government's aim to reduce logistics costs and at the same time, curb emissions in line with COP28 guidelines. Confirming the plans to build e-highways, a senior government official said on condition of anonymity,  The government's focus is to convert roads into electric highways to help substantially reduce logistic costs and bring down pollution levels in the country by switching to green mobility. Electric highways are an energy-efficient option where the roadway provides electricity to moving vehicles mostly through overhead power lines. Currently, the world's longest e-highway spanning 109 km is operational in Berlin, Germany. 106681041According to the official, the ministry of road transport & highways plans to award electrified highways on build, operate, and transfer (BOT) model to private companies. Work is also on to identify and convert existing highways into e-highways by setting up enough charging stations for electric buses to ply between cities, thus giving a boost to cost-effective green intercity public transport. Under this, the cost will be borne by the Centre and states.In September last year, minister for road, transport & highways Nitin Gadkari had said the government is looking at developing electric highways as it is economically viable and is considering various technologies for implementation. The power ministry could provide electricity at subsidised rates, the minister had said, adding private investors could construct electric lines on identified routes and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) can implement an electric tariff system, similar to the tolls payable currently on highways.",

Today, we can proudly say that our Gujarat has a Metro train, bullet train and some very fast moving trains, like Vande Bharat,  state government spokesperson and cabinet minister Rushikesh Patel has said.  The train is expected to operate at a speed of 320 km/hr and carry 17,900 passengers daily in each direction.  The high speed train will have three classes - standard, business and grand, with operational plans featuring a 2-hour 58-minute high-speed journey and a rapid 2-hour 7-minute option. Overcoming the challenges, 429.53 hectares of land has been acquired for the project till June 2023. The impact is not only on the travel sector, but also on industries like cement and steel that can anticipate a significant boost, said a state government release. The Dholera Solar Park is another project propelling Gujarat into the future. Located 80 km from Ahmedabad, this colossal venture is India's largest solar project, having a capacity of 5,000 MW, as per the government. Nestled within the Dholera Special Investment Region (SIR), the park is strategically divided into 11 blocks, spanning 11,000 hectares. Each block utilises cutting-edge poly-crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic module technology, showcasing a comprehensive approach to renewables.  The state government is emphasizing on Special Investment Regions. Spread over an area of 920 square kilometres, Dholera SIR is India's largest greenfield industrial investment region and India's first greenfield industrial smart city to receive a platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council,  Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel said recently.  The Sabarmati high-speed rail station is also undergoing a transformation into a multimodal transport hub, according to officials. Positioned strategically near the Sabarmati stations, Metro and BRTS stops, this project by the National High-Speed Rail Corporation aims to seamlessly connect high-speed rail with the Indian Railways, they said. With a unique twin structure of seven and nine storeys, this hub signifies Gujarat's commitment to modern, sustainable infrastructure. It is a testament to Gujarat's vision for future-proof transportation solutions that promise efficient connectivity and a user-friendly experience for commuters, said a state government release. Another mega project is the Gujarat Hybrid Renewable Energy Park, poised to transform India's energy landscape with a colossal investment of Rs 1.5 lakh crore, according to officials. Located near the India-Pakistan border, spanning from Khavda to Vighakot villages in Kutch district, the project integrates solar panels and wind turbines to yield 30 Gigawatts of sustainable power.  This park has wind energy as well as solar. Both will have a combined production capacity of nearly 30,000 Megawatt. This renewable energy park is coming up with an investment of nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The youth of Kutch will be directly benefited from this project,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said recently.",

        "articleBody": "The risks emanating from not meeting our collective climate change and energy transition goals are clear to all. However, climate change and energy transition must also be seen as an opportunity, especially in developing countries such as India.It is clear that the path to industrialisation cannot happen through burning fossil fuels. India must industrialise without carbonising. Having achieved our first nationally determined contribution (NDC) nine years ahead of schedule, we have set an even more ambitious second NDC.Hard to abate sectors such as steel, fertilisers, cement and long-haul transport are just some areas where green hydrogen can drive the energy transition. Through the National Green Hydrogen Mission, we aim to make India a global green hydrogen hub. During India\u2019s G20 presidency, green development took centre stage. Amongst others, G20 countries agreed on tripling renewable energy capacity, principles on green hydrogen, and launched a global biofuels alliance, in a strong signal to the recently concluded COP28.In 2024, popularisation of solar rooftops must be undertaken in mission mode. This is India\u2019s big opportunity. Despite successes in renewable energy, we have been unable to make a breakthrough in solar rooftops. Many state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) have not yet adopted gross-metering. With gross-metering, consumers will be able to sell excess electricity generated back to the grid, reducing their power bills. Furthermore, the power generated through solar rooftops will be consumed locally, reducing transmission and distribution losses. This would improve the health of distribution companies, reducing the burden on the public exchequer. Gross-metering would also mean that discoms do not lose out on revenue.However, this will require coordination across the central and state governments. SERCs must introduce consumerfriendly gross-metering policies and states should promote this through their existing solar rooftop policies. A national feed-in tariff of Rs 5.50/unit must also be announced and can be tapered down subsequently.The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy must set a target of 50GW of solar rooftop capacity. We must also ensure that tariffs are released on time by discoms. Banks must also be encouraged to assist households. It is only through bold, aggressive action that we will meet our climate and energy transition goals.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday said it is not mandatory for banks and NBFCs to raise green funds, but in case they intend to do so they must follow the prescribed framework. The central bank has issued a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the 'Framework for Acceptance of Green Deposits'.  In April 2023, it had issued detailed guidelines for acceptance of  green deposits  by banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) wherein the funds could be used for financing activities like renewable energy, green transport and green buildings.  The framework came into effect from June 1, 2023.  According to the FAQs, the RBI-regulated entities (REs) should pay interest on green deposits to their customers as per agreed terms and conditions and prescribed directions irrespective of allocation/utilisation of proceeds.  Also,  there is no restriction on premature withdrawal of green deposits, however, the REs shall adhere to the extant guidelines referred to above .  Premature withdrawals will also not have any bearing on activities/projects undertaken using the proceeds of green deposits, as per the FAQs.  REs can temporarily park proceeds of green deposits, pending allocation towards green activities/projects, in liquid instruments with maximum maturity up to one year, it said.  Foreign banks can have a common global policy on green deposits, without prejudice to provisions of the framework for green deposits raised in India after June 1, 2023, it added.  If the green deposits will be denominated in foreign currency, the FAQs said the current framework permits green deposits to be denominated in Indian rupees only.  The financial sector can play a pivotal role in mobilising resources and their allocation thereof in green activities/projects. Green finance is also progressively gaining traction in India, the RBI had said while issuing the framework for acceptance of green deposits by regulated entities.  Some REs are already offering green deposits for financing green activities and projects.  The purpose and rationale for the framework is to encourage REs to  offer green deposits to customers, protect interests of depositors, aid customers to achieve their sustainability agenda, address greenwashing concerns and help augment the flow of credit to green activities/projects .",

        "articleBody": "State-owned NTPC is looking towards listing its green energy vertical in the next 1-2 years, as it anticipates higher demand going forward, its chairman and managing director Gurdeep Singh said on Wednesday. He also said that the entity is expecting a 30-40 per cent rise in capex to cater to increased power demand in the country.   Maybe I think (an IPO) down the line in next one to two years... as we add capacity and there is a pipeline of growth,  Singh said in response to a question on whether the company was looking for listing its green energy vertical.  He was participating in a panel discussion  An Indian Tomorrow,  at the 10th SBI Banking & Economics Conclave here.   We would definitely be looking forward. And that's our thinking process... I think down the line about a year or two, we will be going for listing',  he added.  Singh said NTPC is making power demand stable as per the consumption, adding,  I can assure that as demand goes up again... we will make sure that the power supply is available, and it is affordable as well as reliable power.   Noting that in the last few years energy security has also become paramount, he said while coal-based plants is not a problem, the usage has to be controlled, focussing on solar and hydrogen-based power.  He said that in the next 5-7 years, the fossil and non-fossil fuels' capacity at the entity should be almost equivalent.  Therefore, the company is working on all the front -- coal-based vertical, more aggressively on the solar, green and going forward for the new fuels like green hydrogen chemicals, Singh said.  According to Singh,  As far as Capex is concerned, it has been in the range of around, Rs 25,000 crore and going forward it is going to increase least by 30 40 per cent,  he said.  Singh said that the company has a target to add 60 gigwatt capacity on the renewable side by 2030 and exuded confidence that it may be achieved even earlier.   Today we are having 3.5 gigawatt, which is commissioned while as much as 7.5 gigawatt is under construction.   So, some capacity is getting commissioned every month. Besides this, another around 20 gigawatt is in the different form of the developmental activities,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: As the curtains draw on 2023, India's energy sector emerges as a vibrant tapestry, intricately woven with ambitious renewable initiatives, groundbreaking policy shifts, and strategic global partnerships, all painting a promising picture for a sustainable 2024. This year was a watershed moment for India's green energy ambitions, marked by significant strides towards reshaping its energy narrative and setting a global benchmark in the transition to renewable sources.Marking a significant milestone in India's green energy chronicle was the launch of the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Allocated with a budget of INR 19,744 crore, the mission aims to spearhead India into becoming a global hub for green hydrogen production, targeting an annual output of 5 million metric tonne by 2030. Central to this endeavor is the INR 17,490 crore earmarked under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Programmes, promoting the production of green hydrogen and the development of electrolyzers.The government's resolve in augmenting renewable energy was further underscored by its plan to infuse 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually until FY28. This ambitious strategy aligns with the national objective of amassing 500 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, which includes a robust thrust on wind power, aiming for a minimum of 10 GW capacity addition each year.In a significant move to stabilize renewable power supply, the Union Cabinet sanctioned a INR 3,670 crore viability gap funding scheme for the installation of 4,000 MWh of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). This strategic decision is anticipated to revolutionize India's approach to energy storage and round-the-clock renewable power availability.On the domestic front, the government made a colossal push in solar energy, allocating a total capacity of 39.60 GW for domestic solar PV module manufacturing to 11 companies. This initiative, backed by INR 14,007 crore under the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules (Tranche-II), is expected to draw an investment of INR 93,041 crore, thereby significantly bolstering India's prowess in solar module production.Globally, India reinforced its commitment to sustainable energy solutions by initiating the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) at the G20 Summit, in collaboration with nations such as the US, Brazil, and the UAE. In the domestic arena, the country is progressing steadily towards implementing 20% ethanol-blended petrol by 2025, a move aligned with its overarching goal to curtail carbon emissions and reduce reliance on oil imports.Despite these advances, the path ahead isn't without challenges. The actual pace of renewable energy capacity addition has trailed behind expectations, with projections indicating an addition of merely 20 GW in the current fiscal year and about 25 GW in the next. To meet the ambitious 2030 target of 500 GW, India will need to significantly upscale its annual capacity addition. Moreover, the expansion of the transmission network has been progressing at a slower pace, achieving only 61.5% of its target in the first half of the fiscal year.In nutshell, 2023 has laid a robust foundation for India's renewable energy aspirations. Stepping into 2024, the energy sector is poised for further advancements, with a clear emphasis on sustainability, innovation, and addressing the impending challenges in its journey toward a greener future.",

        "articleBody": "ISTANBUL: The International Energy Agency will work to ensure the World Bank, regional development banks and others prioritise the cost of investing in clean energy in developing countries following the COP28 summit last week, its Executive Director said. World governments agreed to triple renewable energy generation capacity by 2030 and transition away from fossil fuels at the COP28 United Nations climate conference in Dubai. But no mechanism was agreed to finance the transition to clean energy in developing countries. Clean energy investments in emerging and developing countries have been flat since 2015, whereas globally it almost doubled, with most of the growth coming from China and advanced economies, IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Friday on the sidelines of an energy conference in Istanbul.  For the IEA, the main story between now and Baku, will be how we can find de-risking mechanisms to make sure there is a flow of capital to developing and emerging countries,  Birol told Reuters. The next climate summit will be held in Baku next year. Risks mean that the cost of capital for solar plant investments in the developing world could be up to four times higher compared with that in advanced economies, preventing flow of capital, Birol said.  It will be our job to make sure that the financing of clean energy, de-risking those investments, providing concessional funding is a key priority for the World Bank, regional development banks and also the finance sector.   We have more than enough capital in the world now. If the World Bank, regional development banks and financial institutions provide some guarantees, de-risking mechanisms, the money will flow very quickly as the potential is huge,  he said. ",

        "articleBody": "The food ministry has issued a fresh order reversing ban on the use of sugarcane juice for making ethanol and allowed utilisation of the juice as well as B-heavy molasses to produce the green fuel in the 2023-24 supply year. The revised order comes days after the Centre on December 7 banned use of sugarcane juice and sugar syrup for the 2023-24 supply year (November-October) in an order to ensure adequate sugar supply in the domestic market and check prices.  In a directive issued to all sugar mills and distilleries, the ministry said the oil marketing companies (OMCs) will issue a  revised allocation  of  sugarcane juice and B heavy molasses-based ethanol  for the 2023-24 supply year to  each distillery .  OMCs have been asked to inform the food ministry after placement of revised contracts.  After receiving the revised allocation, sugar mills and distilleries have been asked to supply ethanol strictly as per the revised quantity of cane juice and B-heavy molasses.   No diversion of sugarcane juice and B heavy molasses is allowed for production of rectified spirit and extra neutral alcohol,  the directive said.  All molasses-based distilleries will endeavour to make ethanol from C-heavy molasses, it added.  A decision in this regard, Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra said, was taken in the meeting of a committee of ministers held on Friday.  He said the government has decided to give flexibility to use both cane juice and B heavy molasses within a overall cap on diversion of sugar of up to 17 lakh tonnes in the current 2023-24 supply year.  Already 6 lakh tonnes of sugar has been diverted for making ethanol from cane juice before the ban, another food ministry official had said.  The government has estimated sugar production to decline to 32.3-33 million tonnes in the 2023-24 season (October-September) as against 37.3 million tonnes in the previous season.",

        "articleBody": "The world for the first time on Wednesday approved a call to transition away from fossil fuels as UN negotiations in Dubai tackled the top culprit behind climate change, but at-risk countries said far more action was needed.After 13 days of talks and several sleepless nights in a country built on oil wealth, the Emirati president of the COP28 summit quickly banged a gavel to signal consensus among 194 countries and the European Union. You did step up, you showed flexibility, you put common interest ahead of self-interest,  said COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber, whose role as head of the United Arab Emirates' national oil company had raised suspicion among many environmentalists.Describing the deal as bringing  transformational change , Jaber said:  We have helped restore faith and trust in multilateralism, and we have shown that humanity can come together. EU climate chief Wopke Hoekstra called the agreement  long, long overdue , saying it had taken nearly 30 years of climate meetings to  arrive at the beginning of the end of fossil fuels .But with the UN talks requiring consensus, Jaber carefully calibrated the text to bring onboard countries from islands that fear extinction from rising sea levels to oil giant Saudi Arabia, which led the charge to keep exporting its petroleum.Toughening language from an earlier draft that was roundly denounced by environmentalists, the agreement calls for  transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner .It asks for greater action  in this critical decade  and recommits to no net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in hopes of meeting the increasingly elusive goal of checking warming at 1.5 degrees (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.The planet has already warmed by 1.2 degrees and scientists say 2023 was likely the warmest in 100,000 years, as storms, droughts and lethal wildfires expand around the world.John Silk, the negotiator from the Marshall Islands, had warned that the earlier draft marked a  death warrant  for his Pacific archipelago, which is just 2.1 metres (seven feet) above sea level.Silk likened the final agreement to a  canoe with a weak and leaky hull, full of holes  but added:  We have to put it into the water because we have no other option. The small islands did not block the Dubai deal, but a representative from Samoa criticised the language as too weak after contending the group had not arrived yet in the room at Dubai's sprawling Expo City when Jaber declared consensus. We have made an incremental advancement over business as usual when what we really needed is an exponential step change in our actions,  Samoan chief negotiator Anne Rasmussen said on behalf of the island nations, drawing a standing ovation and polite applause from Jaber.US climate envoy John Kerry said that no side can ever achieve everything in negotiations and praised the deal as a sign a war-torn world can come together for the common good. I think everyone has to agree this is much stronger and clearer as a call on 1.5 than we have ever heard before, and it clearly reflects what the science says,  Kerry said.Seeking to avoid the geopolitical tensions that have strained cooperation on other issues, Kerry met ahead of COP28 with his counterpart from China, leading to a joint call by the world's two largest emitters to step up renewable energy.A Chinese envoy said Wednesday that wealthy nations must still do more to help the developing world, a stance shared by Brazil, which will hold the 2025 climate talks in the Amazon.But the Dubai summit at its opening reached an agreement on another major part of the accord -- setting up a loss and damage fund to compensate countries hit hard by climate change.The text stopped short of backing appeals during the summit for a  phase-out  of oil, gas and coal, which together account for around three-quarters of the emissions responsible for the planetary crisis.Environmenalists virtually all saw the agreement as a step forward, although many cautioned that there will still far more to do. We are finally naming the elephant in the room. The genie is never going back into the bottle and future COPs will only turn the screws even more on dirty energy,  said Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa think tank, referring to the annual UN climate meetings known as Conferences of the Parties. Some people may have had their expectations for this meeting raised too high, but this result would have been unheard of two years ago, especially at a COP meeting in a petrostate,  he said.The agreement also made more explicit the near-term goals in the goal of ending net emissions by 2050.It called for the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43 percent by 2030 compared with 2019 levels.But Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity, while seeing progress, said there were still  cavernous loopholes  including recognition of a role for  transitional fuels  -- seen as code for natural gas.The agreement tackles only fossil use in energy, not in industrial areas such as production of plastics and fertiliser.The deal backs a phase-down of  unabated  coal power -- meaning it preserves a role for the dirty but politically sensitive energy source if there is use of carbon capture technology, panned by many environmentalists as unproven.",

        "articleBody": "DUBAI: With virtually every country dissatisfied with the draft global stock take text released by the presidency, COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber had to abandon his plans of making history by closing the conference on time. Had he succeeded in his efforts, then the conference - tasked with reviewing the implementation of the Paris Agreement - would have ended exactly eight years since the 2015 climate deal was adopted.Instead, ministers and negotiators from more than 190 countries met behind closed doors late night on Monday, going into the early hours of Tuesday morning, voicing their disappointments, concerns and hopes. At the same time, ministers and negotiators made it clear that their disappointment notwithstanding, they were more than ready to work towards an agreement that would provide a credible road map to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. It is difficult to come to a result here by mid-day tomorrow. This is not a problem for the European delegation. We have time and we are prepared to stay a little longer,  said German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock late night on Monday. Despite sharing the sentiment, for many small and developing countries, Tuesday was all they had.  We will work through the night  - was a sentiment echoed by many. Negotiators finally called it a night early morning on Tuesday.Meetings and consultations carried on through the day, with countries providing the presidency - which is tasked with preparing the text - with options and formulations that could find general acceptance. A fresh draft building on these consultations was expected to be released by the evening around 6pm local time. However, the promised draft was further delayed. The main issues of contention relate to references on fossil fuels in the section on reducing emissions, finance, differentiation between developed and developing countries, recognition of historical and cumulative emissions, support - particularly finance - for the energy transition and other efforts to reduce emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change through resilient development.A particularly contentious provision of the draft text (para 39) relates to a list of the actions that countries  could  take for the required  deep, rapid and sustained reductions in GHG emissions . These include tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030,  rapidly phasing down unabated coal  and limiting new and unabated coal power generation, increasing the use of zero- and low-emissions technologies, phasing out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.Rich industrialised countries, small island states and some of the least developed countries questioned the absence of a clear reference to phasing out of fossil fuels. The  options  approach, likened to an a la carte menu, to cut emissions was criticised by several developed countries.On the other hand, many developing countries - including Brazil, India and Paraguay - flagged concerns that these  options  were  prescriptive  and were a counter to the system of the Paris Agreement in which climate actions undertaken are nationally determined.Concerns about the lack of differentiation between developed and developing countries were expressed by many members of the latter bloc - G77 and China.",

The power ministry said what should matter is which country is emitting how much, on a per capita basis, whatever be the source of their emissions, according to the response, a copy of which was seen by ET.105883588India refrained from signing the Global Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Pledge at COP28 aimed at tripling renewable energy capacity to at least 11,000 GW by 2030.India was a strong force behind the G20's New Delhi declaration in September which adopted a similar text, but the COP28 pledge had a caveat that aimed for phasing down of unabated coal power. Phasing down or phasing out of unabated coal cannot be agreed to till the time storage and abatement technologies become viable,  said one of the persons cited earlier, who did not wish to be identified.More than 50% of India's electricity needs are met by coal-based power plants. India needs stable and affordable sources of energy, as its energy demand is continuously growing and is expected to reach a peak of 335 GW by 2030.The country does have ambitious targets for adding clean energy capacities. It is aiming for 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and has laid out a trajectory to bid out 50 GW of such capacity every year for five years from this financial year.India is committed to achieving its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) commitment of having 50% share of non-fossil fuel installed electricity capacity by 2030. It expects the share of non-fossil fuels to surpass NDCs and have around 65% in the total installed capacity by 2030, the ministry said. However, renewable energy is not available round the clock, it said.The power ministry said to make power affordable and available round the clock and to avoid any scenario of load shedding in future, India will need to add 80 GW of thermal capacity by 2032 while pursuing an increased share of renewables in the energy mix.Earlier India was expecting this capacity to be 50 GW, but it was increased by 30 GW amid growing demand in the country and it is expected to rise further.The ministry said that instead of pushing developing countries to cut their emissions, the developed countries need to accelerate their mitigation efforts to allow a fair share of remaining carbon space to be available to developing countries.",

        "articleBody": "DUBAI: Negotiators have been urged to narrow down their options so they can agree on how to save Earth from disastrous levels of warming and help vulnerable societies adapt to weather extremes as the clock runs down on United Nations climate talks. COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber told journalists Sunday afternoon that negotiators were  making good progress,  just not fast enough.   Am I satisfied with the speed and the pace?  al-Jaber said, as protesters could be heard nearby calling for the end of fossil fuels.  The answer is no. ... Time has come for us to shift gears. Time has come for us to deliver.  There some were signs negotiators were moving forward Sunday: A new draft agreement on global adaptation goals - which will determine how poor countries will brace themselves for climate change-fueled weather extremes like drought, heat and storms - was released. The draft text expresses concern over the gap between the money needed for adaptation and how much countries are getting, but it doesn't say exactly how much cash countries need to adapt to climate change.  One option in the draft proposes an assessment of each country's vulnerability to climate change by 2025 and to establish early warning systems for extreme weather events by 2027. Another option is for countries to come up with national adaptation plans and implement them by 2030. The new draft  presents the skeleton of what could be a reasonable framework  on how to adapt to climate change, said Ana Mulio Alvarez of climate think tank E3G, but to be effective, adapting to climate change  requires developed countries to provide support to developing countries  to actually enact plans. Mohamed Adow of climate think tank Power Shift Africa said that the draft  sets clear targets, but overall the text is weak  as it doesn't adequately address how to finance adaptation. Thibyan Ibrahim from the Small Islands Developing States negotiating bloc called the progress on adaptation  a bit disappointing.  A draft text on the Global Stocktake - the part of the negotiations that assesses where the world is at with curbing warming and how countries can stick to climate goals - were still stuffed with several options over how to phase-out planet-warming fossil fuels.  Now is the time to shift gears and get to consensus,  COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber said in a plenary session late Saturday. Shantal Munro-Knight, a climate negotiator for Barbados, said motivation to get a strong deal among countries was high.   I don't think anyone wants to go away from the COP without a really ambitious program, and that's where I think everybody is. You didn't hear negative pushback too much because we are all in that moment,  Munro-Knight said. But Marshall Islands Climate Envoy Tina Stege acknowledged  there is a lot more work that needs to be done. The presidency has a lot on its plate and we don't have a lot of time.   Sticking points are along familiar lines for negotiators, with some countries wanting to see strong language on phasing out the use of fossil fuel while others are hesitant to have forceful language on the issue because they're continue to develop their oil, gas or coal industries.  It's very clear that there is a group of countries here that don't want to phase out fossil fuels,  said German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan. Small island states, Latin American countries and European countries are pushing for a phase-out, but other nations are  still far apart.    It's going to be very difficult,  Morgan said.  I'm a bit worried.  Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists told journalists Sunday that  the big laggards, the ones being obstinate, is definitely Saudi Arabia and the OPEC countries,  the powerful oil cartel. Brandon Wu of ActionAid USA also criticized America's plans to expand oil and gas production.   I think it's quite easy to point the finger at some of the Gulf states here,  Wu said.  But, you know, we should not ignore the fact that the United States has the single largest oil and gas expansion plans of any country in the world by far. It's not even close.  Democratic U.S. Sen. Ed Markey from Massachusetts, acknowledged the Ukraine war boosted domestic natural gas production because  the LNG industry in the United States saw an opportunity to dramatically expand its footprint.  But he added:  We cannot preach temperance from a bar stool. We cannot tell the rest of the world you should move toward a renewable energy future if we ourselves are spreading this LNG poison around the world.  Meanwhile, an analysis by the Paris-based International Energy Agency on Sunday found that the several pledges made at COP28 to move to clean energy - hundreds of countries promised to triple renewables and double energy efficiency and several oil and gas companies pledged to slash their methane emissions - were nowhere near what's needed to cap warming to to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. If countries and companies kept their promises, it would result in around four gigatons fewer of carbon pollution globally by 2030. That covers about 30% of the  emissions gap  - the difference between how much the world is currently emitting and how much it can emit if the world is to meet its climate goals.  We are seeing positive developments at COP28,  said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol, but  there is a need for more countries and companies to join the pledges - and for agreement on an orderly and just decline of global fossil fuel use.  Some observers on Sunday were cautiously optimistic about the progress so far.  We are close to making history here,  said Kaisa Kosonen, Policy Coordinator at Greenpeace International.  Never before have I seen this level of pressure, with people saying let's just do it. They are finally addressing the root cause of climate change. ",

        "articleBody": "Calling the electrification drive in India's transport sector one of the most significant opportunities, US Special Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry on Saturday said the quicker India pursues this initiative, the more it mitigates greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a reduction in pollution and enhancement of the country's overall security. Kerry said embracing rapid electrification not only aligns with environmental goals but also contributes to a cleaner, more sustainable, and secure future for the country.  Speaking at an event at the Indian Pavilion during the global climate talks COP28, Kerry said:  Electrification in India is one of the biggest opportunities that we have. The faster that India can do this, the more it cuts greenhouse gas emissions and it cuts pollution, it increases India's security.   He said supply chains play a critical role in India's booming economy, which is currently witnessing the rapid growth of new urban centres.  Embracing Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's visionary concept of a circular economy and expanding access to low-carbon public transport is an exciting prospect, the former secretary of state said.  Taking a significant first step towards realising this vision involves India's commitment to electrify 50,000 buses, Kerry said, stressing the goal set by the Modi-led government.  It is imperative to underscore that this effort is a collaborative endeavour, he added.  Kerry said the focus is on implementing Indian solutions to maximise domestic opportunities, particularly in the endeavour to decarbonise the transportation sector.  This initiative builds upon India's past successes in envisioning and implementing the deployment of 50,000 electric vehicles, marking a substantial stride towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation practices, he added.  Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav was also present at the gathering.  To achieve the goal of net zero emissions, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) plays a crucial role and given that buses serve the mass public, prioritising electric buses is essential as a significant mode for decarbonising the transport sector, Yadav said.  He said that this transition to e-buses, however, posed challenges to public transport authorities (PTAs) owing to their high upfront costs and lower realisation of revenue from operations.  The India-US Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) for e-buses will serve as an incentive for both Indian and international original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or bus operators to participate in e-bus operations and potentially establish a manufacturing hub in India, contributing to the growth of e-bus industry and e-bus exports, Yadav added.

The 2015 Paris Agreement addresses this gap through the decision to put in place a global goal that mirrors that for mitigation.Over 8 workshops and two years countries have been working to develop this framework, which countries are expected to agree to in Dubai. Countries, however, are nowhere near agreement.The lack of an agreement is mainly due to the divergence on the kind of targets that countries need, and on ensuring rich industrialised countries provide adequate flow funds to help developing countries build systems to withstand the impacts of climate change. Some negotiators hold Saudi Arabia, which leads the Arab Group at COP28, responsible for the lack of consensus.This pushback, according to an observer, is because concerns on equity and justice raised by developing country groups do not find reflection. Developing countries would like clear targets such as setting a timeline to ensure that vulnerable communities are covered by early warning systems.",

        "articleBody": "DUBAI: In a departure from its proactive efforts in Sharm El-Sheikh, India has been silent on the question on phasing out or down of fossil fuels at COP28.Despite its aggressive renewable energy targets and its role in the adoption of the G20 commitment to triple renewable energy capacity, India has so far maintained a studied silence on the issue of fossil fuels at the ongoing UN Climate Conference in Dubai.At COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh last year, India had proposed inclusion of clear language on phasing down all fossil fuels, not just coal, as agreed at the Glasgow meet.Though the proposal failed to make the final cut, it gained the support of at least 80 countries and the European Union. This tentative alliance between India, the EU, and small island states was viewed by some observers as a new approach that was ambitious while being rooted in equity.The proposal had not found support from India's traditional negotiating partners such as China and Saudi Arabia.Now, at Friday's plenary marking the start of the second week of negotiations in Dubai, India did not address the issue in its intervention.Instead, it extended support for the position taken by the 43-member Like-minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group that includes China, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, and Egypt, among others. In its intervention, LMDC said the focus should be on reducing emissions rather than on  sources .India's failure to take up from where it left off in Egypt has been something of a disappointment, particularly given its record on renewable energy, climate activists and observers said. India reversing its position on phase-out or phase-down of fossil fuels and joining China and the Arab countries for removing any references in the negotiating text at COP28 is disappointing but not surprising in absence of any references to means of implementation and finance for energy transition,  said Sanjay Vashist, director at Climate Action Network South Asia, a coalition of over 250 civil society organisations in eight South Asian countries working to promote actions to limit human-induced climate change.Addressing the conference on Saturday, environment minister Bhupendra Yadav highlighted India's record on clean and renewable energy.  India has also achieved 40% of electric installed capacity through non-fossil fuel sources nine years ahead of the target for 2030.",

        "articleBody": "National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited president Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar on Friday urged the Centre to reconsider its decision to stop the use of sugarcane juice and sugar syrup for ethanol production, as he expressed fear that the move may increase the woes of the sugar industry. Due to this decision, India may not be able to achieve the 20 per cent ethanol blending target by 2025, he said. Ethanol, a colourless liquid, is blended with fuel as part of the government's initiative to reduce reliance on crude oil imports. The Union government on Thursday banned the use of 'sugarcane juice and sugar syrup' for ethanol production in the 2023-24 supply year, which started this month, to maintain adequate sugar availability for domestic consumption and to keep prices under check. However, it has allowed use of 'B-molasses', a cane by-product, for ethanol production in 2023-24.  The government should reconsider its decision or grant higher prices to ethanol and sugar. The country may not be able to achieve the target to blend 20 per cent of ethanol in petrol if this decision continues. This move will push the sugar industry into problems,  he told PTI. Sugar factories cannot survive on sugar production alone. Of the total ethanol produced in the country, 50 to 52 per cent is produced using sugarcane juice. So no other food grain can achieve this, Dandegaonkar said. He added that India has the lowest prices of sugar at present.  If the sugar industry has to sustain, the government should increase the prices of sugar. There is also a need to give higher prices to ethanol produced from B and C molasses,  he said.  This (decision) is being done to keep the sugar prices low as they (government) think that the production of sugar may go down this year. The government should reconsider this decision or grant higher prices to ethanol and sugar. I have not spoken to anybody at the Centre about it so far. But we may go to Delhi with a delegation next week,  he added.",

        "articleBody": "Dubai: As the first week of the COP28 summit draws to a close, the issue of energy transition is dominating the talks. Fossil fuels, the principal driver of human-induced climate change, is the main faultline. There is broad acceptance on increasing renewable energy capacity to underwrite the transition. But differences exist on detailing out the transition. There is a growing consensus on tripling global renewable energy capacity to 11,000 GW and doubling the rate of energy efficiency by 2030. The Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge, launched on Saturday, has now signed up 123 countries. This growing support is reflected in the negotiations on the global stock take (GST). There are, however, some countries that would not like clear numerical targets for renewable energy.India did not sign up to the pledge despite its aggressive domestic renewable energy programme because of the call for no new investment in coal. India is concerned about the efforts by some countries to introduce time-bound and quantified phase-out of coal as part of the GST text. Those privy to the negotiations said that India was among the countries that opposed the option that called for an  immediate cessation  of new unabated coal power generation and the reference to IPCC pathway which requires  a reduction of unabated coal use by 75 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030 .  Unabated  refers to coal power generation units without carbon capture and storage or carbon capture, utilization and storage. Effectively that is all of India's coal power generation capacity. The most recent version of the GST text that is publicly available does not include any alternate language for the clause that focuses on coal. Through Tuesday and Wednesday, countries have provided their responses on the text, a fresh text is only expected on Friday. But how the clause on accelerating renewable energy and the fossil fuel phase out is addressed will be critical. There is also a growing demand for the phase out of all fossil fuels, that would include oil and gas as well. Unlike in Sharm El-Sheikh, where India initiated the call for phasing out all fossil fuels, it has been silent in Dubai. The UAE presidency has described the phase out of all fossil fuels as  inevitable  but while it has been clearer about phasing out coal.Adding a layer of complexity is the growth in global fossil carbon dioxide emissions-projected to increase by 1.1 per cent in 2023. Increase in coal use in India and China is the major driver of this rise fossil carbon dioxide emissions.Talks on how the energy transition will be reflected in the Dubai agreement will be taken up at the ministerial level from Friday.",

        "articleBody": "It's the issue at the core of COP28: will this year's U.N. climate talks, held in major oil producer the United Arab Emirates, produce the first global agreement to phase out fossil fuel use? Burning fossil fuels for energy is by far the biggest cause of climate change. It is also the engine of modern life - even with the growth of renewables, fossil fuels produce around 80% of the world's energy. U.N. climate negotiations over the last three decades, however, have yet to address the issue head on. The COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021 made the first tangible progress toward a fossil fuel exit deal with an agreement to reduce coal use, but without mentioning oil and gas. At COP28 in Dubai, more than 80 countries are pushing for a broader pact to phase out all CO2-emitting fossil fuels.  The 'phase out' is a tool to reach the goal. And the goal is an energy system that has no emissions,  Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barthe Eide told Reuters at COP28.  Not low emissions, but emissions free.  Aside from Norway, Europe's biggest oil and gas producer, excluding Russia, this position is also backed by western producers the United States and Canada, the 27-country European Union, climate-vulnerable small island states, some African nations including Kenya and Ethiopia, and Latin American countries Chile and Colombia. Opposition to a full fossil fuel phase out, diplomats told Reuters, is led by Russia, Saudi Arabia and China, which is the world's biggest carbon emitter. Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that his country would  absolutely not  agree to a deal that calls for a phase down. Sultan Al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirates' COP28 president, said on Monday he was calling on countries to propose language on fossil fuels for the COP deal.  The phase down and the phase out of fossil fuels is inevitable,  said Jaber, who is also CEO of the UAE's state-owned oil firm ADNOC. Countries' negotiators have only days to find agreement before the summit's scheduled end on Dec. 12. EQUITY Some representatives of African nations have said they could support a phase out deal if wealthy countries, who have long produced and used fossil fuels, agree to quit first.  To tell Uganda to stop fossil fuels, it is really, really an insult. It's like you are telling Uganda to stay in poverty,  Uganda's energy minister Ruth Nankabirwa said. Uganda, Mozambique and others on the continent with low electricity access rates plan to develop or expand their oil and gas production. Uganda began drilling its first production well this year. Nankabirwa told Reuters the country could accept a long-term phase out, if it made clear that developing nations can exploit their resources in the near term, while wealthy long-time producers quit first.  First in, first out - and we will be happy to be the last one to exit from fossil fuels,  she said. Diplomats and observers told Reuters a group of countries including China and Saudi Arabia have consistently raised the issue of  equity  during COP28 talks, emphasising wealthy industrialised nations' high historical contribution to climate change. Some said they doubted whether these nations would support a phase out, however, even if the issue of equity was addressed. EMISSIONS TECH Another sticking point in the talks around the future of fossil fuels is whether the deal should allow for continued consumption on condition that their planet-warming CO2 emissions are captured, or  abated.  The vast majority of the world's power plants are unabated. Diplomats say that Saudi Arabia wants a COP28 deal that includes a focus on carbon capture technologies, which remain expensive and not used at scale. The U.N.'s climate science panel - the IPCC - has said steep fossil fuel cuts are needed to avert more severe climate change. Alongside this, it sees a limited role for carbon capture to zero out the world's emissions by 2050. The U.S. and EU support a COP28 deal that recognises these technologies, which can help polluting sectors such as cement or steel to bring down their emissions. But they want caveats in the deal to prevent carbon capture promises from being used to excuse business as usual. Overall, European nations say the COP deal must clearly ask countries to cut their fossil fuel use enough to stop global warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and unleashing far more severe impacts.  That is what 1.5C means. You can't keep burning fossil fuels,  Irish Climate Minister Eamon Ryan told Reuters.  There will be a small amount, abated, in hard-to-reach sectors... but that can't be a get-out-of-jail card for international fossil fuel companies.  Some negotiators told Reuters they and other phase out advocates could agree to something short of a full phase out, provided the world's direction of travel is clear.  Oil consumption is going to go down. It's inevitable in my view,  Canadian climate minister Steven Guilbeault told Reuters.  Whether it's in the text or not, it's happening,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "With carbon markets holding the potential to mobilize real climate action, forums such as COP28 could bring us a step closer to regulation and standardization.One of the interesting solutions to be discussed before, at or even after COP28 is carbon markets. Until now, carbon markets have largely been a grey area for a wide variety of reasons, including the lack of a common view on what emissions to consider, how to validate and verify bilateral trading of carbon credits and how to create a globally regulated market. However, since COP26, nations have shown a greater intent towards making carbon markets viable and making carbon offsets a part of international trade. The global carbon market value hit a record US$909 billion in 2022. Despite criticisms about their effectiveness, ongoing efforts are dedicated to addressing the associated challenges of their complexity, susceptibility to potential fraud, including issues like double counting of emissions reductions. Additionally, their effectiveness can be questioned if the price of carbon credits is not set at an appropriate level, which may undermine their ability to incentivize emissions reduction. These challenges can be tackled by establishing a global regulated carbon market.At global forums, such as COP28, we can expect further discussion and a more tangible outcome on all the grey areas of carbon markets. Carbon markets can mobilize actual climate actionCarbon markets represent a global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by operating as a specialized financial market for the buying and selling of carbon credits. These credits effectively serve as permits, allowing the holder to emit a specific amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. By assigning a financial value to emissions, they offer incentives for nations and businesses to reduce their emissions over time while imposing financial penalties on those exceeding their allocated emissions in regulated markets. Some carbon markets are administered and regulated by governments or international bodies, with certain industries mandated to participate, while others can do so voluntarily. A carbon tax is another way that enables governments to control greenhouse gas emissions by imposing a tax based on emissions volume, lacking the option of purchasing credits to offset emissions. Carbon markets encourage market-based emissions reductions, stimulate innovation, and offer flexibility to choose cost-effective solutions, while carbon taxes impose a set price on emissions, potentially stifling innovation. Transparency and standardization are the focus areas for carbon market regulationsA regulated carbon market enhances climate action by establishing transparent emission reduction targets and implementing a market-based mechanism to attain them. Such an approach is cost-effective and allows companies to choose efficient methods for reducing emissions, thereby fostering innovation, investment in clean technologies, and sustainable practices. This, in turn, drives economic growth and job creation. Regulatory frameworks ensure transparency and accountability, preventing double counting of emissions reductions. These markets align with international agreements like the Paris Agreement, aiding countries in meeting their emissions reduction targets. By driving investments in challenging sectors and offering flexibility in which emissions reduction methods are adopted, carbon markets can create economic opportunities and accelerate the transition to cleaner practices. Overall, they are integral to the global effort to combat climate change and foster a sustainable, low-carbon future.Taking steps toward a global regulatory frameworkForums such as COP28 play an instrumental role in addressing the regulation of carbon markets and rectify their shortcomings. Emphasis should be laid on transparency, clear purpose, community engagement, and simplicity. Ownership rights, accountability, and alignment with NDCs under the Paris Agreement should be critically considered. Both voluntary and official carbon markets should prioritize integrity, benefiting all stakeholders while protecting the environment.UNFCCC (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) has taken a significant step in strengthening global climate efforts by drafting key regulatory documents for a new UN carbon crediting mechanism. These include procedures for project cycles, activity standards, validation and verification standards, and accreditation procedures, and thus also provide a framework for others to follow in implementing carbon crediting mechanism.Additionally, UNFCCC focused on creating safeguards to protect social and environmental rights, introducing an Appeals and Grievances Procedure and a Sustainable Development Tool. It is actively working on recommendations for carbon emissions removal and methodology guidelines, essential for the effective operation of the mechanism which is over and above business as usual (BAU) reductions. The initiative is a positive stride towards addressing climate change and fostering international cooperation. Establishing comprehensive global carbon market regulations at the least ensures that there is uniformity in rules, processes and even definitions. It also enables a framework that countries can use to collaborate on climate goals At the same time, a monitoring body can be established to prevent abuse of processes and loopholes as well as suitable revisions. A global effort is critical in the fight against climate change, mitigating its impact and ensuring a sustainable future for all.(The author is a Partner, Climate Change and Sustainability Services, at EY India)",

        "articleBody": "A phase out of  unabated  coal and  an orderly and just  phase out of fossil fuels are among the range of options mentioned in a new draft text of Global Stocktake, the first periodic review of the collective global efforts to restrict temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, released on Tuesday. The Global Stocktake (GST) text released by the negotiators is considered as the most crucial document of theCOP28 and is set to be finalised at the end of the ongoing two-week long annual climate conference here.  India and other global south countries have consistently demanded that there be phasing out of oil and gas too and not just coal, a demand in view of the fact that rich nations burn oil and gas themselves but point fingers at the burning of coal by poorer countries. At the Glasgow edition of the COP in 2021, India had insisted on 'phasing down' coal instead of 'phasing out.'  As part of the Paris Agreement of 2015, where more than 190 nations agreed to cut down on carbon emissions to restrict global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era (1850-1900), the exercise of global stocktake, therefore, holds larger significance as it will help countries make necessary changes in their action plans to prevent further exacerbation of severe climate impacts.  The initial draft GST text provides several options, including an  orderly and just phase out of fossil fuels  and a rapid phase out of unabated coal power this decade.   Unabated  fossil fuels generally refer to the continued use of coal, oil, and gas without efforts to curtail emissions. However, a universally accepted and precise definition of this term is currently lacking.  There is a mounting global push for a phase out of fossil fuels, which are the largest contributors to global climate change, accounting for more than 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions.  Fossil fuel-producing nations and companies have been resisting these demands. They argue that they should be allowed to keep extracting oil and gas as long as they capture carbon emissions using sophisticated technologies, which experts say are  expensive and unproven.   The draft text also emphasizes tripling global renewable energy capacity and energy efficiency rates by 2030 and significantly scaling up zero and low-emissions technologies, including carbon capture, utilisation, and storage by 2030.  It welcomes the operationalisation of a fund to address irreversible loss and damage caused by climate change, urging developed nations and others to contribute voluntarily.  The UN climate talks opened with a bang on November 30 as countries swiftly clinched an early deal on how to compensate developing and poor nations bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, despite contributing little to it. The establishment of a fund to address loss and damage has long been sought after by these nations for years.  Reflecting the demands of poor and developing countries facing disproportionate climate impacts, the draft text states that doubling finance to help poorer nations adjust to climate impacts is just an  initial step.   Contention remains over the wording surrounding the USD 100 billion pledge by developed countries to support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing nations.  It also calls for addressing emissions from all sectors of economies and covering all greenhouse gases, a point of opposition from developing countries.  The draft text of the Global Stocktake at COP28 discusses pushback against  unilateral measures,  specifically like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) proposed by the EU. This measure, aiming to levy a carbon tax on imports from developing nations like India, has strained diplomatic relations. Countries like India, Brazil, China, and Russia prioritised addressing this issue at COP28.  Climate experts warn that if more developed nations adopt similar measures, it could impose carbon taxes on exports from developing nations, potentially hurting their growth and job opportunities.  Vaibhav Chaturvedi from a New Delhi-based think tank notes that such unilateral actions erode trust between developed and developing nations.",

        "articleBody": "The United States, Canada and Kenya were among 63 countries to join a pledge on Tuesday to deeply cut cooling-related emissions at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai. The Global Cooling Pledge marks the world's first collective focus on climate-warming emissions from cooling, which includes refrigeration for food and medicine and air conditioning. It commits countries to reduce by 2050 their cooling-related emissions by at least 68% compared to 2022 levels, along with a suite of other targets including establishing minimum energy performance standards by 2030.  We want to lay out a pathway to reduce cooling-related emissions across all sectors but increase access to sustainable cooling,  U.S. climate envoy John Kerry told COP28. Some 1.2 billion people who need cooling still lack access. Installed capacity is set to triple by mid-century, driven by climbing temperatures, growing populations and rising incomes.  Imagine a slum community, an informal settlement, the housing made of corrugated iron, and on the side an air conditioner,  Freetown mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr of Sierra Leone told a COP28 news conference.  The aspiration of everyone as temperatures rise and incomes rise is that their wealth is measured by their cooling.  But all those extra ACs double down on the climate crisis, with cooling emissions expected to reach between 4.4 billion and 6.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050, according to a report by a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) coalition, which also developed the pledge alongside the COP28 UAE presidency.  People will buy a very cheap air conditioner produced somewhere in Asia for 100 bucks and plug it in,  said Jurgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danish multinational Danfoss which specializes in heating and cooling.  That will load the energy system a lot, and there will be a collapse .  I don't think it's a good idea to allow these individual plug-ins anymore,  he said. Reuters was first to report U.S. support for the cooling pledge, which suggests there could be a process to construct more regulations or incentives for the industry in the United States. India, which is likely to see the greatest growth in demand for cooling in the coming decades, still had not joined the pledge as of Tuesday morning. Indian government officials earlier told Reuters they were not willing to undertake targets above those committed to in 1992 under the multilateral Montreal Protocol to regulate production and consumption of ozone depleting chemicals and hydrofluorocarbons used in cooling. Nearly three-quarters of the potential for reducing cooling emissions by mid-century can be found in G20 countries, the UNEP report said.  The countries who are signing up ... they are now really taking action and working with industry in order to deploy sustainable solutions,  said Danfoss' Fischer. At least 118 countries are also supporting another COP28 pledge to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency rates by 2030. Progress on meeting the aims of the cooling pledge will be tracked on an annual basis until 2030, with check-ins at the yearly U.N. climate summits.",

Global emissions from coal, oil and gas are all projected to increase by 1.1, 1.5 and 0.5 per cent, respectively, even as they are predicted to decline in the EU and the USA by 7.4 and 3 per cent, respectively, the research team that included the University of Exeter, UK, and 90 other institutions globally said in its report. The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by more than 120 scientists, provides an annual, peer-reviewed update, building on established methodologies, the researchers said. The report projects total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, arising out of both fossil fuels and land-use change, to be 40.9 billion tonnes in 2023. Of these, 36.8 billion tonnes would be from fossil fuels, up 1.1 per cent from 2022. Atmospheric CO2 levels are projected to average 419.3 parts per million in 2023, more than 50 per cent above pre-industrial levels, the researchers said in their report to be published in the journal Earth System Science Data. Further, current levels of technology-based Carbon Dioxide Removal, which exclude nature-based means such as reforestation, amount to about 0.01 million tonnes CO2, more than a million times smaller than current fossil CO2 emissions, they said. About half of all CO2 emitted continues to be absorbed by land and ocean  sinks,  with the rest remaining in the atmosphere where it causes climate change, the researchers said.  On the possibility of meeting the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement, the research team estimated a 50 per cent chance global warming will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius consistently in about seven years, if current emissions persisted.  It now looks inevitable we will overshoot the 1.5 degrees Celsius target of the Paris Agreement, and leaders meeting at COP28 will have to agree (on) rapid cuts in fossil fuel emissions even to keep the 2 degrees Celsius target alive,  said Pierre Friedlingstein from the University of Exeter, who led the study.",

        "articleBody": "As world leaders dwell on the language of the final outcome of climate talks, billionaire Gautam Adani on Tuesday made a pitch for adopting a balanced approach that takes into account energy costs and availability while continuing to accelerate on green ambitions. At the 28th UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai, called COP28, 118 governments pledged to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030 but have not been able to arrive at the language to be used in the outcome document for cutting the share of fossil fuels in the world's energy production.   In the midst of initial encouraging signs from COP 28, it is relevant to remember that while in sum total (given our 1.4 billion population) we are the world's third largest primary energy consumer, our per capita electricity consumption @ 1250 kWh is still less than one-third of the global average and less than one-seventh of the developed world,  Adani said in a post on X.  India, he said, is also the only large nation ahead of its target in meeting its UNFCCC commitment to reduce its emissions intensity by 45 per cent from the 2005 level by 2030.   The fastest growing economy must balance its energy cost, energy availability and green energy objectives while continuing to accelerate its massive green ambitions,  he added.  On his post, the coal-to-edible oil conglomerate he heads commented:  With a pledge of investing USD 75 billion by 2030, Adani group is playing a pivotal role in accomplishing this  task of reducing emission intensity.  To keep global warming from rising no more than 1.5 Celcius by 2050, fossil fuel use needs to be greatly reduced and unabated coal use needs to be completely phased out, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has argued. But India is not agreeable to phasing out of coal as 73 per cent of its current electricity is produced from burning the fossil fuel.  The share of coal-fired electricity generation in India's power mix is slated to rise to 77 per cent by 2025 after considering the projects already announced, before falling to 71 per cent in 2030 and 52 per cent in 2050 primarily because of the rise in share of renewable power.  An overnight shift away from coal, which is the cheapest available feedstock in India, to other sources such as natural gas or nuclear power will not just jack up electricity bills but also lead to supply issues as enough alternate fuels aren't available.  India is targeting installing 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Also it is looking at reducing the emissions intensity of its economy by 45 per cent and cutting a billion tonnes of CO2.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change wants oil use to be slashed by 60 per cent and natural gas demand by 45 per cent by 2050.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, The proposed 5 per cent blending of biogas with natural gas supplies in the country can cut LNG imports worth USD 1.17 billion annually, says a study by the Indian Biogas Association (IBA). The study comes against the backdrop of the government's recent mandate to blend one per cent biogas with piped natural gas (PNG) supplies in the country from April 1, 2025 under the compressed biogas blending obligation (CBO) scheme.  The biogas blending is proposed to be further increased to 5 per cent by fiscal year 2028-29.  According to the study, this blending initiative gels well with the government's macro-level move to make India a gas-based economy, with a target to increase the current share of gas in the energy mix from 6 per cent currently to 15 per cent by 2030.  The IBA estimates show that 5 per cent blending of biogas with natural gas can reduce LNG imports worth USD 1.17 billion. This can also bring down per capita CO2 emissions by two per cent, benchmarked to the 2019 figure, which was 1.9 metric tonne of CO2 per person in India.  Additionally, the body says preventing organic waste going to landfills can bring innumerable benefits.  The CBO scheme shall encourage investment of around Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the establishment of at least 750 compressed bio gas (CBG) projects by 2028-29, as per government estimates.  This is going to improve India's energy security, as it is currently heavily reliant on imported natural gas to meet its energy needs.  Blending biogas with PNG and CBG can help reduce this dependence, which is invaluable.  Biogas blending has the potential to demonstrate a positive correlation with agricultural income growth too, which is the case with ethanol as well.  Every additional large-scale plant can ensure that almost 1,000 acre of nearby biogas plant area can be converted into organic agriculture.  Biogas can be produced from various organic waste sources, such as agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and food waste.  This can create new economic opportunities for farmers, waste management companies, and other stakeholders involved in biogas production.  Blending of biogas with natural gas will streamline the market for biofuels, making it more investor-friendly by reducing capital and operational costs, the body says.  It also needs to be emphasised that selling biofuels in the market will become smoother, and the ecosystem will benefit from increased investor confidence, IBA stated.",

        "articleBody": "Dubai: India didn\u2019t sign the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge that aims to triple global renewable energy capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency by 2030. That\u2019s despite having successfully ensured a commitment to the aspiration by the G20 in the New Delhi Leaders\u2019 Declaration. India has a domestic target of increasing its renewable energy capacity to 450GW from its current level of 130GW by 2030.New Delhi\u2019s absence from the list of 118 countries that joined the pledge came as something of a surprise. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had highlighted India\u2019s role as G20 president in securing the agreement on renewable energy capacity and energy efficiency. All the G20 countries \u2014 barring India, China and Russia \u2014 have signed on to the pledge launched on Saturday by COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber. The pledge seeks to triple global installed renewable energy capacity to at least 11,000GW and double the global energy efficiency improvement rate to more than 4% by 2030.As G20 president, India had pushed for the adoption of a numerical target for the tripling of renewable energy, without much success. \u201cWhat is interesting is that as the G20 presidency, India pushed for not just the idea of tripling renewable energy capacities but also attempted to set a target, 11,000GW by 2030. In its efforts, India was supported by only the European Union (EU) and its member states,\u201d said a senior delegate privy to G20 negotiations on energy.India\u2019s decision not to join the pledge can likely be attributed to the focus on coal and investments in it.It can also be due to a principled position on not joining initiatives that could prejudice or undermine ongoing negotiations under the UN climate framework. The language of the pledge on coal, according to some experts, does present a problem for India. The pledge recognises the need to increase the pace and scale of deployment of renewables and energy efficiency significantly between now and 2030 for a system free of unabated fossil fuels.But instead of a phasing out all fossil fuels, the pledge stresses the need to ensure that the renewables deployment is accompanied by the phasedown of unabated coal power. It calls for \u201cending the continued investment in unabated new coal-fired power plants, which is incompatible with efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\u201dWith an energy demand growth of 8% and with its overwhelming dependence on domestic financing for energy transition, it is difficult for India to agree to completely turn away from coal. \u201cPledges become relevant when they effect change on the ground and ensure that renewables are affordable everywhere through de-risking, guarantees or partnerships,\u201d said Linda Kalcher of the Brussels-based think tank Strategic Perspectives.The pledge is part of efforts to undertake measures that will help tackle climate change and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Under its COP28 presidency, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has put together a package of initiatives that are designed to speed up energy transition and reduce global emissions.\u201cThe world does not work without energy, but the world will break down if we don\u2019t fix the energies we use today,\u201d said Al Jaber. \u201cThe world will break down if we don\u2019t mitigate the emissions at a gigatonne scale. The world can potentially break down if we don't rapidly transition to zero-carbon alternatives.\u201dThe Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge is part of this package, focusing on \u201cbuilding the energy system of tomorrow.\u201d Many of the elements build on advancements made in other forums such as the G20 Delhi Declaration.",

        "articleBody": "Dubai: India and China both on Saturday refrained from signing the pledge at the COP28 climate summit to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030 even though New Delhi already committed to it as part of its G20 presidency. During the UN's climate talks here, 118 countries committed to tripling the global renewable energy capacity by 2030 in a highly endorsed initiative.  This ambitious goal aims to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels in the world's overall energy production.  The countries which backed the pledge included Japan, Australia, Canada, Chile, Brazil, Nigeria, and Barbados.  Although China and India have expressed endorsement for the threefold increase in renewable energy by 2030, neither of them formally supported the comprehensive pledge on Saturday.  This commitment involves scaling up clean power alongside a decrease in the utilisation of fossil fuels.  The pledge called for phase down of unabated coal power and putting an end to the financing of new coal-fired power plants.   Unabated  fossil fuels generally refer to the continued use of coal, oil and gas without efforts to curtail emissions. Nonetheless, a universally accepted and precise definition of this term is currently lacking.  The International Energy Agency says the world must triple its renewable energy capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency by 2030 to drive down demand for fossil fuels and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.  India's decision has gauged mixed reactions from Indian experts.  Madhura Joshi, Senior Associate and India Energy Transition Lead at E3G, expressed disappointment over India's decision not to sign the global pledge aiming to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency by 2030.   These pivotal decisions were initially championed by the Indian G20 presidency and endorsed by G20 leaders in September 2023,  Joshi said.  Joshi highlights the significance of transitioning away from fossil fuels, particularly coal, to achieve net-zero commitments. Despite India's ambitious targets for renewable energy, with plans to reach 450GW by 2030, the hope is that New Delhi will endorse these global goals at COP28, leveraging its leadership position in the renewables sector.  Vibhuti Garg, Director of South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, notes India's commitment to tripling the renewable energy target as part of the G20, reiterated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP28 in Dubai.  While India exhibits serious ambitions for renewable energy, Garg emphasised the country's silence on coal phase-down.   Achieving India's renewable energy goals will necessitate a tripling of investments, prompting the country to advocate for additional funding support from the Global North through blended finance mechanisms, including multilateral development bank (MDB), green bonds, equity investors, and insurance and pension funds,  he added.  Ulka Kelkar, the Executive Director of Climate at World Resources Institute (WRI) India, underscored the global target of tripling renewable energy capacity adopted during India's G20 presidency.  She highlighted the magnitude of India's National Determined Contributions (NDC) target, requiring the country to build as much renewable capacity as currently exists on the entire continent of South America.  Kelkar emphasises the transformative impact on various sectors, enabling vehicles, buildings, cookstoves, and industries to run on cleaner electricity.  Additionally, she recognises energy efficiency as a crucial component of the clean energy transition, capable of delivering tangible benefits, especially for micro, small, and medium enterprises.  Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General of the International Solar Alliance, expresses delight at the global commitment to tripling renewable capacity by 2030.  He emphasised the dual benefits of fostering development and mitigating climate change, emphasising the urgency of accelerating the growth of renewables for a successful transition towards clean energy.

        "articleBody": "Gandhinagar: India, the world's third-largest energy consumer, will see its energy needs doubling by the end of this decade as it witnesses an unprecedented explosion of economic growth, the nation's richest man Mukesh Ambani said on Saturday. Speaking at the convocation of Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Ambani, who heads the nation's most valuable company Reliance Industries Ltd, said the Indian economy will become a USD 40 trillion economy by 2047 from the current USD 3.5 trillion.  And to fuel this growth, the country will need enormous amounts of energy - clean, green energy that won't choke mother nature for the sake of human progress,  he said.  In fact, India's energy requirement is set to double just by the end of this decade.  Ambani is pivoting its largest fossil-fuel-dominated conglomerate to clean energy, investing billions of dollars in building giga factories to produce new energy ecosystems as well as generate renewable energy, and produce green hydrogen. Addressing the convocation, he said in the next 25 years, India will witness an unprecedented explosion of economic growth, and it is a crucible to turn the vision of a clean, green, and sustainable tomorrow into reality.  As India races to build a robust energy infrastructure to meet its energy goals, it faces three crucial questions: One: How can it ensure that every citizen and every economic activity in India has access to adequate, most a\ufb00ordable energy? Two: How can it rapidly transition from fossil fuel-based energy to Clean and Green Energy? Three: How can it de-risk the expanding needs of its fast-growing economy from a volatile external environment? I call these three questions the Energy Trilemma,  he said. Energy transition, he said, has become the most critical factor in ensuring India's transformation into a global leader in green, sustainable and inclusive development. Expressing confidence in India developing smart and sustainable solutions to address this trilemma, he said this would be possible because extremely talented young minds have vowed to fight the climate crisis.  They will design breakthrough energy solutions to build not just a strong and Atmanirbhar India, but also a safer and healthier planet,  he said. To students, he asked them to be fearless, never losing confidence in their own abilities and skills.  Courage is the ship that can safely sail you across the stormiest seas. You will commit mistakes. But let that not worry or deter you. The one who succeeds in life is the one who corrects his mistakes and continues on his mission boldly,  he said. Also, they should dream big but be disciplined.  Your dreams should be big and ambitious. For they act as the propeller accelerating your life's journey. Set audacious goals for yourself and pursue them with commitment and passion. Take risks. But do not be reckless,  Ambani added. But dreams come true only if you are hardworking and disciplined, he said, adding that the distance between dreams and reality is called discipline. Also, students need to be curious and hungry for new knowledge.  Stepping out of the portals of this university does not mark the end of knowledge-seeking. Rather, it is only a new beginning. If you want to succeed in your chosen profession, you must remain a lifelong learner. Therefore, embrace curiosity, stay hungry for knowledge, and be open to new ideas. Remember, in the journey of self-improvement, the pursuit of knowledge is an endless adventure,  he said. Asking students to be empathetic, he said cultivating the power of the intellect is good but cultivating the power of empathy is equally important for both success and happiness in life.  Be caring, compassionate and generous at heart.  Above all, they should be patriotic.  I am what I am in life because of India, because of Bharat. Wherever your life takes you, contribute your utmost to the greatness and glory of India. And know that you are truly blessed to be young in today's India... an India that is today marching ahead so confidently that the 21st Century is indeed going to be India's Century,  he added.",

        "articleBody": "DUBAI - Some 117 governments pledged to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030 at the U.N.'s COP28 climate summit on Saturday, as a route to cut the share of fossil fuels in the world's energy production.  The pledge was among a slew of COP28 announcements on Saturday aimed at decarbonizing the energy sector - source of around three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions - that included expanding nuclear power, cutting methane emissions, and choking off private finance for coal power.   This can and will help transition the world away from unabated coal,  said Sultan al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirates' COP28 summit President. Led by the European Union, United States and UAE, the pledge also said tripling renewable energy would help remove CO2-emitting fossil fuels from the world's energy system by 2050 at the latest. Backers on Saturday included Brazil, Nigeria, Australia, Japan, Canada, Chile and Barbados. While China and India have signalled support for tripling renewable energy by 2030, neither backed the overall pledge on Saturday - which pairs the ramp-up in clean power with a reduction in fossil fuel use. Backers including the EU and UAE want the renewable energy pledge included in the final U.N. climate summit decision, to make it a global goal. That would require consensus among the nearly 200 countries present. The pledge, a draft of which was first reported by Reuters last month, also called for  the phase down of unabated coal power  and an end to the financing of new coal-fired power plants. It also included a target to double the global rate of energy efficiency by 2030. Climate vulnerable countries insisted that the goals must be paired with a deal among countries at COP28 to phase out the world's use of fossil fuels.   It is only half the solution. The pledge can't greenwash countries that are simultaneously expanding fossil fuel production,  said Tina Stege, Climate Envoy for the Marshall Islands.  While deployment of renewables like solar and wind has been surging globally for years, rising costs, labour constraints and supply chain issues have forced project delays and cancellations in recent months, costing developers like Orsted and BP billions of dollars in writedowns.  Hitting the target for 10,000 gigawatts of global installed renewable energy by 2030 will also require governments and financial institutions to hike investments and address the high cost of capital that has stymied renewable energy projects in developing nations.  The mismatch still exists between our potentiality and our limitations to attract investment,  said Najib Ahmed, a consultant at Somalia's climate ministry. Africa has received just 2% of global investments in renewable energy over the last two decades, the International Renewable Energy Agency said.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ5toNsjHas NUCLEAR NUDGE More than 20 nations also signed a declaration on Saturday aiming to triple nuclear power capacity by 2050, with U.S. climate envoy John Kerry saying the world cannot achieve  net zero  emissions without building new reactors.  We are not making the argument that this is absolutely going to be the sweeping alternative to every other energy source,  Kerry said during a launch ceremony at COP28.  But ... you can't get to net-zero 2050 without some nuclear, just as you can't get there without some use of carbon capture, utilisation and storage,  Kerry said. Global nuclear capacity now stands at 370 gigawatts, with 31 countries running reactors. Tripling that capacity by 2050 would require a significant scaling up in new approvals - and finance. Other pledges took aim at coal, the most CO2-emitting fossil fuel. France said it would rally a group of nations to ask the OECD to measure the climate and financial risks attached to investing in new coal assets, to deter private financiers from backing projects. Coal users Kosovo and the Dominican Republic also agreed to develop plans to phase out their coal-fuelled power. Meanwhile, nearly 50 oil and gas companies including Exxon Mobil signed the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, an initiative driven by COP President Sultan al-Jaber to cut operational emissions by 2050. The charter was criticized by environmental groups who said the commitments were merely a distraction from the COP28 process and fail to deal with the emissions caused by burning fossil fuels.  The pledge doesn't cover a drop of the fuel they sell, which accounts for up to 95% of the oil and gas industry's contribution to the climate crisis,  said Melanie Robinson, Global Climate Program Director at the World Resources Institute. METHANE EMISSIONS The Biden administration on Saturday also unveiled final rules aimed at cracking down on U.S. oil and gas industry releases of methane, part of a global plan to rein in emissions that contribute to climate change. Meanwhile, several governments, philanthropies, and the private sector said they have mobilized $1 billion in grants to supports countries' efforts to tackle the potent gas. Two major emitters of methane, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, joined the Global Methane Pledge, a voluntary agreement by over 150 countries to slash their methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The World Bank on Saturday launched an 18-month  blueprint for methane reduction  that will set up 15 national programs aimed at cutting methane emissions from activities like rice production, livestock operations, and waste management.

        "articleBody": "Dubai: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched an initiative focusing on generating Green Credits through plantation on degraded wasteland. During a high-level event at the ongoing climate talks or COP28 in Dubai, he highlighted that the Green Credits Initiative surpasses the commercial nature of carbon credits.  Carbon credits, driven by a commercial mindset, have limited scope and lack associated responsibility. We need to move away from a destructive mindset that prioritises personal benefit,  the prime minister said. The Green Credits Initiative operates on the premise that environmental conservation is intertwined with personal growth, he said. This initiative involves creating an inventory of degraded wastelands, which can be utilised for planting by individuals and organisations. Participants undertaking environmentally positive actions will receive tradable green credits. The entire process, from registration to plantation, verification, and issuance of green credits, will be digitised. The prime minister also announced the launch of a global portal to collect ideas, knowledge, and experiences related to tree planting and environmental conservation. This platform aims to influence global policies, practices, and the demand for green credits. The Green Credits Initiative mirrors the Green Credit Programme launched domestically in October. It's a pioneering market-based mechanism rewarding voluntary environmental actions in various sectors by individuals, communities, and the private sector.",

        "articleBody": "Some of the world's biggest charities have joined forces with the World Bank's private investment arm in a climate financing venture to try to generate $11 billion in investments in developing countries. Launching the Allied Climate Partners (ACP) platform on Friday, the group aims to use an initial $825 million to attract far more private cash than any previous blending of public and private money of this kind has managed. Getting more money to poorer countries to help them shift to a low-carbon economy - total climate-related investment needs are estimated at $2.4 trillion annually - is a central theme of the COP28 climate talks in Dubai. Mark Gallogly's Three Cairns Group and the Bezos Earth Fund are among the charitable donors that aim to seed the ACP with $235 million, with a further $590 million expected to come from investors including the World Bank's International Finance Corporation. Jamie Fergusson, IFC's Global Head of Climate Business, told Reuters ACP was one of the biggest entries of philanthropic capital into a world that has been overly reliant on sovereign sources.  In the absence of sufficient flows from north to south, getting leverage out of the pockets of blended finance is really vital,  Fergusson said. The venture's backers hope their cash will lead to an eventual total of $11 billion raised in debt and equity finance for climate-related projects. They also hope it can address the problems of past public-private partnerships that have been stymied by concern about high levels of risk. Ventures such as ACP can help to bridge the gap as the public or charitable money absorbs more risk, for example by taking on a project's first losses. If the $11 billion target is hit, ACP said it would equate to a 14 times multiple of the platform's capital, and a 47 times multiple of the philanthropic cash - far in excess of the typical ratio of 1-1 for deals led by some development banks, and IFC's own ratio of 6 or 7.  You are getting multiple layers of leverage through that process,  Fergusson said. In reaching its estimates, ACP said it had modelled assumptions such as a 42% failure rate, which it believes is conservative. IFC's early-stage projects in emerging markets have suffered high failure rates and unappealing returns, Fergusson said, but was confident ACP's backers and the structure have advantages. As junior capital, the philanthropies' will take the first loss, acting as effective insurance to attract the additional investment from multilateral lenders. The money will then be given to fund managers based in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Central America, and India, which are chosen by ACP. Those managers will decide which projects to develop and try to raise the billions of dollars needed in debt and equity finance to complete them. ACP hopes the process will also help to build local asset management industries that can eventually finance projects alone.  We are seeking to catalyse the growth of climate finance in developing countries,  ACP Chief Executive Ahmed Saeed told Reuters. Other philanthropic backers of the ACP include Arnold Ventures, Ballmer Group, Anita and Josh Bekenstein, the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) and Sea Change Foundation International, ACP said. As well as the IFC, ACP is working with British International Investment (BII), the African Development Bank (AfDB), and Proparco, a subsidiary of Agence Francaise de Developpement Group.",

        "articleBody": "Dubai: The UN climate talks here opened with a bang with countries clinching an early deal on how to compensate developing and poor nations that bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite contributing little to it, a decision welcomed by climate activists with caution. The agreement on the operationalisation of the Loss And Damage Fund on the first day of the annual climate negotiations, called COP28, sets the stage for ambitious decisions over the next 12 days.  At the COP27 in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh last year, rich countries agreed to establish a loss-and-damage fund. However, the decisions on funding allocation, beneficiaries and administration were referred to a committee.  Differences between countries were so stark that it necessitated additional meetings to resolve these issues.  A draft agreement was arrived at earlier this month and a revised agreement was released a day ago. It asked the developed countries to contribute to the fund but said other countries and private parties could also make contributions.   What was promised in Sharm El-Sheikh has already been delivered in Dubai,  Dr Sultan Al Jaber, COP28 president said and added:  The speed at which the world came together, to get this Fund operationalised within one year since Parties agreed to it in Sharm El-Sheikh is unprecedented.   This decisive action on Loss and Damage will enable the Parties to focus on the strongest possible response to the Global Stocktake (GST), the world's report card on progress toward Paris Agreement goals.   This Fund will support billions of people, lives, and livelihoods that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change,  Jaber said.  I want to thank my team for all their hard work to make this possible on day one of COP28. It proves the world can unite, can act, and can deliver.    Over the next two weeks, this Presidency will work with Parties to now deliver the highest-ambition response to the GST.   COP of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a platform where more than 190 countries hold discussions to reduce carbon emissions to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era as per the Paris Agreement of 2015. The text of the draft stated that developed countries are  invited  to make contributions and developing countries say the actual needs are closer to USD 400 billion per annum.  All developing countries are eligible to directly access resources from the Fund, with a minimum percentage allocation floor for Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. Developing countries have called for 'direct access' for recipient countries and vulnerable communities.  This is despite disagreements between developing countries and developed countries over various issues such as the World Bank being the entity for the fund and mechanisms such as direct access.  Allocations will prioritise those most vulnerable to climate change but any climate-affected community or country is eligible, it said. The pledges made so far include USD 100 million each from the UAE and Germany, USD 40 million to the Fund and 20 million pounds for other funding arrangements for loss and damage from the UK, USD 17 million from the US and USD 10 million by Japan.   Amid the historic decision to operationalise the Loss and Damage Fund within a year of its establishment, addressing underlying concerns becomes critical. On one hand, rich countries have pushed for the World Bank to host this fund under the guise of ensuring a speedy response. Conversely, they have attempted to dilute their financial obligations and resisted defining a clear finance mobilisation scale,  said Harjeet Singh, head of the global political strategy at Climate Action Network International.  Ambassador Pa'olelei Luteru, chair of the AOSIS, representing the interests of 39 small island and low-lying coastal developing states at the international climate change negotiations, said the work is  far from over.    After the gavel drops at COP28, we cannot rest until this fund is adequately financed and starts to actually alleviate the burden of vulnerable communities. Success starts when the international community can properly support the victims of this climate crisis, with efficient, direct access to the finance they urgently need,  he said.  Avinash Persaud, developing country negotiator and special climate envoy to Barbados, and PM Mottley, said this is a hard-fought historic agreement.  It shows recognition that climate loss and damage is not a distant risk but part of the lived reality of almost half of the world's population and that money is needed to reconstruct and rehabilitate if we are not to let the climate crisis reverse decades of development in mere moments,  he said.  Ulka Kelkar, Director, Climate Change Programme, World Resources Institute (WRI) India, said developed countries need to pledge new and additional funds to the Loss & Damage Fund so that support can be provided to countries and communities where it is most urgently needed.   This support should be in the form of grants rather than loans that risk further indebting these economies. It needs to go beyond commercial insurance provisions, which can fail in the face of recurring and widespread disasters,  Kelkar added.",

        "articleBody": "India should not take new commitments at the ongoing United Nations COP28 climate talks in Dubai and continue its green transition without additional assurances, think tank GTRI suggested on Thursday. The climate conference is being held at the Dubai Expo City from November 30 to December 12.  The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that India has already made significant commitments at COP27 (Conference of Parties) and the Paris Agreement, aligning with its Long-term Low Emissions and Development Strategy. India's commitment to generating half of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070 is noteworthy.   At COP28 India need not take new commitments at COP28. Instead, it may continue its green transition without additional commitments,  GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.  However, he added that the country's high methane emissions, especially from the agriculture sector, pose a challenge.   Any improvement will require changing crop pattern which may take decades of efforts. Balancing emission reduction with the livelihood impact on the agriculture sector is crucial,  Srivastava said.  The think-tank also suggested that as 70 per cent of electricity is generated from coal power here and many large industries rely on captive and not grid power, India needs to improve on these.   However, India should not agree to an immediate shutdown of coal-fired power plants to ensure energy security. India must highlight that developed countries are responsible for 89 per cent of historical emissions. They subsidized the fossil fuel industry with USD 1.8 trillion in 2020,  it said.  It added that India should advocate for broadening the scope of climate discussions to address these interconnected challenges, fostering a more effective approach to climate action.  Further it said that despite fifty years of international efforts, annual GHG (greenhouse gas emissions) emissions have increased by 270 per cent, reaching 53.8 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022..   The rising GHG emissions underscore the insufficiency of current efforts to meet the agreement's goals. Highlighting this will be the focus of COP28,  it said adding India's role at COP28 is crucial, given its status as a developing nation and the third largest emitters of carbon dioxide gases after China and the US.  But India must emphasise the fact that its per capita CO2 emissions at 1.9 tons are  very  low, far lower than the USA (14.5) and China (8.9) those of all developed countries and China, it said.   Large population converts even low per capita emissions into big total, India cannot be punished for being a large population. COP28 obligations must be tied up with per capita emissions and not a country's total emissions,  Srivastava said.",

        "articleBody": "On the tenth episode of Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS), a key area of focus has been the Green Hydrogen and Green Energy Sector across the VGGS Roadshows and Delegation Visits. To incentivize investments in the green hydrogen domain, the Government of Gujarat has introduced a land allotment policy offering benefits to companies engaged in green hydrogen projects. Mandating substantial milestones, companies are required to meet specific green hydrogen production capacity criteria within defined time frames to encourage rapid growth in the sector.The series of discussions held between the Government of Gujarat and international players from France, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, and domestic entities specializing in energy and green hydrogen from Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata, and Chandigarh have outlined opportunities available in Gujarat for collaboration and investment.Gujarat presently contributes around 15% to India's Renewable Energy capacity and aims to source 50% of its energy from renewable sources as part of the Renewable Energy Policy 2023, thus supporting India's target of reducing carbon emissions by 45% by 2030.Several companies have shown keen interest in investing in various sub-sectors, encompassing alternative fuels production, technology solutions infrastructure, lithium-ion battery manufacturing, solar PV modules manufacturing, decarbonization initiatives, and green hydrogen production. Danish Maritime companies have expressed interest in procuring green methanol and green ethanol from Gujarat ports, further indicating growing interest and diverse avenues for green energy.Noteworthy Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) have been inked with companies like MeOH Giga Battery and Australian Premium Solar Pty Ltd (Australia), along with collaborations between Indian entities such as Welspun and Kiri Industries with Lili Navitas and Sundronix (Germany), facilitating the export of Green Hydrogen and Green Ammonia from Gujarat to Europe.Significant investments have been secured, exemplified by Shakti Group's commitment of INR 1,000 Crores towards manufacturing green methanol and green ethanol in Gujarat, aligning with the state's vision for a sustainable future.It may be mentioned here that the Chemical sector also remains another key area for VGGIS 24 and the Government of Gujarat convened numerous meetings during the International and National roadshows and Delegation visits, engaging with prominent global and national players in the chemical sector.Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, for the records is currently on a week long tour to Japan and Singapore and has already held a series of one on one meetings with the senior officials of various companies in Japan. Patel has conveyed that the state is also poised to become hub for the emerging sectors ling renewable energy, semi conductor and invited representatives from the green hydrogen, renewable energy, logistics, semi conductor, pharmaceuticals and drugs and industrial automation sectors to VGGIS 2024.",

        "articleBody": "The country can mobilize as much as $543 billion from retail investors for climate investments by 2030, while the global potential for the same is a whopping $3.4 trillion, says a report. A Standard Chartered Bank report on sustainable banking, is based on investor interest from a survey of 1,800 respondents in 10 growth markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  According to the survey, of the $543 billion investible retail capital that can be mobilized in the country, $324 billion could flow into mitigation themes such as energy efficiency, renewables and energy storage, while $219 billion could be pumped in for adaptation including resilient infrastructure, biodiversity and food systems.  The survey shows 96 per cent of investors in the country are interested in climate investing -- the highest among all markets surveyed, and 84 per cent of them want to increase capital flows towards climate investments.  Though these investors are motivated by making a positive impact and personal values when making such investments, they also say that multiple barriers are holding them back from translating their interest into investment.  The respondents cited accessibility (76 per cent), comparability (75 per cent), comprehensibility (73 per cent) and comparability (74 per cent), as major barriers.  According to Marc Van de Walle, global head of wealth management at the bank, overall climate mitigation and adaptation face an annual funding gap of trillions of dollars.  To overcome the current disconnect between investor interest and the scale of climate investments, the industry needs to improve access to solutions, harmonise reporting standards and measurement of impact.  According to Saurabh Jain, head of wealth management at Standard Chartered India, climate change is a key challenge for the country given its frequent extreme weather events, growing population and increasing urbanization, highlighting the need to bring rapid focus into building climate-resilient infrastructure and staying on course to achieve the country's net-zero targets.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's 14th National Electricity Plan (NEP) sets it on a path to more than triple its renewable energy capacity by 2030, but the country needs a whopping USD 293 billion to achieve this, according to a report released by global energy think tank Ember on Wednesday. The International Energy Agency (IEA) says the world must triple its renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030 to decrease the need for fossil fuels and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Led by the US, the European Union (EU), and the UAE, over 60 countries now support the commitment to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency. While the G20 nations have endorsed tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 under India's presidency, the UAE, hosting this year's UN climate conference, advocates for a global agreement on this at COP28. Ember's analysis reveals that India requires an additional financing of USD 101 billion (one billion=Rs 100 crore) to further expand its renewable energy capacity and align with the IEA's proposed net-zero scenario. The IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario outlines a global pathway to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with advanced economies reaching net zero emissions ahead of others. In climate terms, net zero means achieving a balance between the greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere and those taken out. The Ember report suggests that India is already planning a substantial increase in renewable energy, making it feasible to achieve the goal of tripling renewable energy capacity. However, if the country aims to follow the IEA's plan and achieve  net-zero  status (where it doesn't produce more greenhouse gases than it removes), it needs to set even higher goals. This implies that India would need to generate around 32 per cent of its energy from solar and 12 per cent from wind by 2030. To achieve this, India will need to add an additional capacity of 115 GW of solar and 9 GW of wind by 2030, on top of the targets set in its NEP14 plan. This will increase India's total renewable capacity to 448 GW of solar and 122 GW of wind by 2030. India's current goal is to reach 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. Between 2023 and 2030, the country requires USD 293 billion to meet its current goals for solar and wind power, the report said. However, to further expand the country's renewable energy capacity to align with the IEA net-zero pathway, it will need an additional USD 101 billion. The think tank highlighted issues such as payment delays and unfavourable rules and regulations that deter investors from providing the necessary funding to achieve these goals. The financial requirements to achieve both the NEP14 target and the IEA net-zero scenario far surpass the current investment and funding capacities available in India, the report said. Neshwin Rodrigues, Ember's India Electricity Policy Analyst, said,  Despite investment risks, India needs financing to build capacity in renewables, storage, and transmission to meet the NEP14 targets. To further enhance ambitions to align with the global net-zero pathway, securing significantly more financing at competitive rates will be crucial to ensure India's viability in reaching this goal. Access to this finance is critical for India to avoid constructing new coal capacity to meet its rising demand in this decade. ",

        "articleBody": "The per capita carbon (CO2) footprint of the top 1% and the top 10% income groups in developed countries is four to eight times greater than their counterparts in developing nations, according to a study by the Delhi-based policy research institute Council on Energy, Environment, and Water.Carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide emissions generated by all the activities of a person or an entity.The study, released ahead of COP28 (Conference of Parties), says the affluent, especially in developed nations, have played a substantial role in increasing global carbon emissions.COP28 is the annual United Nations climate meeting where governments will discuss how to limit the earth's rising temperature and prepare for future climate change. The summit is being held in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), from 30 November until 12 December 2023.Rising CO2 emissions worldwide are responsible for increasing climate impacts, such as droughts, floods, cyclones, wildfires, and other extreme events.An individual from the richest 1% income bracket in the US, Australia, or Saudi Arabia emits 228 tCO2 (total carbon dioxide), 197 tCO2, or 182 tCO2, respectively, while the top 1% in India emits just about 31.7 tCO2, which is six to seven times lower (2019 data). The emission inequity is so stark that individuals in the top 10% income group in developing nations emit less CO2 than an average earner in developed countries,  the study says. In comparison, in 2020, per capita CO2 emissions in Saudi Arabia and the United States were 14.2 and 13 metric tonnes, while the per capita emissions of Brazil and India were only 1.94 and 1.57 metric tonnes, respectively.The study suggests that if the richest decile from developed countries and China reduce their CO2 footprint by half, they can still save more than 3.4 billion tonnes of CO2 annually. Encouraging the adoption of low-carbon lifestyles among this group can lead to significant annual reductions in CO2 emissions. Even if they reduced their per capita emissions by 50%, they would still be emitting 1.5 to 2.5 times more than the national average. CEEW adds that a carbon tax on the top 10% of selected countries can shore up $500 billion and discourage highly carbon-intensive consumption patterns. These funds can be used for climate change mitigation, research and development, de-risking clean technology, and building resilience to mitigate climate change impacts. However, implementing a carbon tax that targets specific income brackets may have certain implications and complexities. Therefore, it requires a well-designed policy that carefully considers both environmental and socioeconomic consequences. ",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi/Geneva, Transitioning to a more sustainable and carbon-neutral future will require USD 13.5 trillion in investments by 2050, particularly in the production, energy and transport sectors, a new World Economic Forum report said on Tuesday. The report noted that major producing countries and regions such as India, China, the US, and EU have now committed to net-zero targets, making it imperative for businesses within their jurisdictions to align their operations and strategies with the evolving regulatory landscape.  However, complex and ever-changing policy regimes result in businesses allocating substantial resources towards compliance, impeding progress, and therefore establishing more consistent and stable regulatory frameworks with well-defined timelines is imperative for mitigating these risks, it said.  Taking stock of progress towards net-zero emissions for eight industries that emit 40 per cent of global greenhouse gas, the World Economic Forum Net-Zero Industry Tracker 2023 report said global funding and stronger policy incentives are needed to scale clean power, clean hydrogen and carbon capture around industrial clusters.  The eight industries analysed in the report, published in collaboration with Accenture, included steel, cement, aluminum, ammonia, oil and gas, aviation, shipping and trucking.  These industries depend on fossil fuels for 90 per cent of their energy demand and pose some of the most technological and capital-intensive decarbonization challenges.  While the pathway to net-zero in these sectors will differ based on unique sectoral and regional factors, investments in clean power, clean hydrogen and infrastructure for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) will be needed to accelerate industrial decarbonization across most sectors.  According to the report, the USD 13.5 trillion in investments is derived from average clean power generation costs of solar, off-shore and on-shore wind, nuclear and geothermal, electrolyzer costs for clean hydrogen and carbon transport, as well as storage costs.  Carbon pricing, tax subsidies, public procurement and the development of strong business cases can support in mobilizing necessary investments, said Geneva-based WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation committed to improving the state of the world.  However, raising capital for high-risk projects with unproven technologies could be challenging in the current macroeconomic environment.  Institutional investors and multilateral banks, therefore, can play an important role by providing access to low-cost capital linked to emissions targets; equally vital is adapting financial models to the needs of various industries and regions.  The report noted that in countries like India and China, national-level action plans and roadmaps for clean hydrogen have been adopted to encourage investments across the hydrogen value chain that aid large-scale industrial transformation.  Also, the G20 member countries have agreed to guiding principles that enable the production, consumption and global trade of clean hydrogen.  In the US and Europe, where internal combustion engine (ICE) trucks are substantially more expensive than in India and China, the upfront net capital investment required to achieve net-zero is 25-30 per cent more than continuing to use mostly diesel.  However, in India and China, where ICE trucks are cheaper, the incremental costs of zero emission trucks (ZETs) and their infrastructure are more significant.  It further said that America relies on secondary processes for 70 per cent of its steel production. Other major steel producing regions like India and the EU exhibit a more balanced distribution between primary and secondary steelmaking.  In India and the US, capital flows will need to address the maintenance of the existing electric arc furnace (EAF) asset base as capacity expansion will be limited by scrap availability.  The twin forces of urbanization and population growth are driving cement consumption in China (51 per cent of global demand) and India (9 per cent of global demand), which necessitates accelerated action to decarbonize the cement sector to mitigate the impacts of increased production, the WEF said.",

        "articleBody": "Shimla: Unemployed Himachali youth above the age of 23 years will be given a 50 per cent subsidy on loans to purchase e-taxis and e-buses with no collateral guarantee under a state government scheme to generate employment and promote green initiatives. In case the cost of the e-taxi is Rs 20-lakh, a subsidy of Rs 10 lakh will be provided, and these e-taxis would be attached to various government departments. A monthly income of about Rs 40 thousand will be ensured, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said on Monday. Launching the e-taxi scheme under the first phase of Rs 680 crore Rajiv Gandhi Self-Employment Start-up Yojna and a website of the Transport Department to facilitate online registration, he said the scheme for the youth was one of the key promises made in the Pratigya Patra of the Congress Party. In a statement issued here, he said that 500 permits would be issued in the first phase, and the number of permits will be increased as per the demand in the near future. The government is committed to providing employment to the youth and making Himachal a green state by 2026, and a fifty per cent subsidy will be given to unemployed youth for the purchase of e-taxis and e-buses. Besides, no collateral guarantee will be required for raising loans from the banks, he said while talking to the media persons. Youth keen on purchasing e-taxis or buses would be required to apply for e-taxi in the portal started by the government within a month, and eligible youth above the age of 23 years will be linked to the startup scheme and e-taxi permits would be issued, Sukhu said while talking to the media persons. Once the e-taxi permit is issued, it would be registered with the Labour Department, which would facilitate the loan process without collateral guarantee after depositing the margin money and release of the subsidy directly through the banks for the purchase of taxi, he added. To facilitate the smooth running of e-vehicles, charging points would be set up at all the petrol pumps of Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum, and Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) and State Electricity Board have also been asked to provide e-charging stations on six identified corridors, Sukhu said. The government is planning to replace the entire fleet of about 3,000 buses of HRTC with e-buses, and 350 e-buses will be purchased shortly and 1,500 e-buses in three years to encourage e-buses in the private sector. The government has issued 24 e-buses permits out of a total of 107 permits and a subsidy of Rs 50 lakh would be provided for an e-bus costing Rs 1 crore, Sukhu said. Under the second phase of this scheme, the youth would be encouraged to set up solar energy projects. The draft of this scheme was being finalised and soon this scheme will also be rolled out, he added. The youth would be provided a subsidy for agriculture-related work under the third phase of the scheme. A scheme was also being prepared to provide a 90 per cent subsidy to youth for pisciculture, the statement said.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The Centre may earmark half of the incentives it plans to offer to bidders under the advanced chemistry cell (ACC) performance-linked incentive (PLI) programme to support manufacturing of grid energy storage batteries, said officials.They said 10 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of the 20 GWh ACC battery PLI incentives being rebid will be for electric vehicles (EVs), while the rest will be for supplementing renewable energy capacity addition.\u201cLithium batteries have two primary applications \u2013 EVs and electricity storage. We can stipulate conditions that mandate making batteries for meeting the requirement of the electricity grid,\u201d said a senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.It is estimated that India needs 120 GWh of battery storage by 2030 to support 500 GW renewable capacity addition.Incentives worth Rs 7,240 crore are slated to be offered under the current leg of auctions for setting up 20 GWh of ACC battery manufacturing capacity. Public consultation on this issue took place in July. These sops are part of an Rs 18,100 crore PLI scheme for the sector.The ACC PLI programme is presently being speared by the Ministry of Heavy Industries. Deliberations are also underway within the government to cede administration for some of the battery PLI supports to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.Last year, the Ministry of Heavy Industries awarded PLI support for setting up 30 GWh of ACC battery manufacturing capacity by 2030. Ola Cell Technologies won the lion\u2019s share with 20 GWh capacity in their kitty. ACC Energy Storage (bid as Rajesh Exports) and Reliance New Energy Battery Storage were awarded incentives for 5 GWh each. The Centre expects PLI incentives will aid in creation of 95 GWh of battery manufacturing capacity by these three players.This is not the first auction for the 20 GWh PLI capacity. Initially, it was allocated to Hyundai Global Motors, a company said to be impersonating South Korean firm Hyundai Motor Co.Earlier, the Centre expected an investment of Rs 45,000 crore from the four initial PLI beneficiaries, but it was scaled down to Rs 27,000 crore after the Hyundai Global Motors fiasco.PLI support for making the batteries will be offered to bidders in batches of 5 GWh. Existing PLI beneficiaries can also bid, but the cap of 20 GWh per player will remain in force to prevent any one player from getting a larger share of the incentives on offer. ACCs are a new generation of advanced storage technology, with applications in EVS, maintaining grid stability, solar rooftop and consumer electronics, among others.",

        "articleBody": "The Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) has released a new phased manufacturing program (PMP) for electric vehicle (EV) charger parts to support the FAME India Scheme Phase-II, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing.In a recent notification dated November 7, 2023, the government outlined a comprehensive list of charger components alongside their respective timelines for indigenization, meaning the switch to domestically manufactured parts.The list includes essential parts like charger enclosures, internal wiring harnesses, and software for charge point operators (CPO) and management systems (CMS), with immediate effect from 1 December 2021. More complex parts such as power electronics and various types of charging guns are slated for indigenization by January 2023 and June 2024, respectively.This policy stipulates that to be eligible under the FAME-II scheme, EV charger manufacturers must achieve a minimum of 50 per cent domestic value addition by 1 December 2024. This is calculated based on the ex-factory price of the charger minus the value of imported components, ensuring that a significant portion of the manufacturing value chain remains within the country.The move is expected to incentivize the setting up of more public EV charging stations, which is currently seen as a bottleneck in the adoption of EVs due to range anxiety among consumers. By establishing a timeline for indigenous manufacturing, the government aims to reduce import dependency and foster a self-sufficient ecosystem for EV infrastructure.To ensure compliance, the financial claims of domestic value addition will be supported by audited financial statements and verified by the testing agency of the ministry of heavy industries. This detailed manufacturing roadmap is anticipated to not only boost the local automotive parts industry but also align with the government's broader goals of environmental sustainability and reduction of fossil fuel dependence.The directive has been approved by the competent authority and is in line with the Government of India's vision of achieving a greater degree of self-reliance and boosting the domestic manufacturing sector as outlined in the 'Make in India' initiative.",

The calendar of bids - both quantum and their timing - is tweaked, if necessary, based on the inputs by the renewable energy implementing agencies,  he said.Regarding the availability of modules and cells, Bhalla expressed confidence that sufficient domestic capacities will be added in due course which will cater to the demand of renewable energy project developers.Around 60-80 GW integrated capacity, from polysilicon to solar modules and wafer to solar modules, is likely to be available in the country by 2026-27. Through the two tranches of the production-linked incentive scheme for domestic solar photovoltaic module manufacturing, a total 48 GW of such capacity is required to be added. However, companies are adding more capacity than allocated to them under the scheme.The ministry had, in March, exempted ongoing solar projects from the mandatory rule of procuring photovoltaic modules from the 'Approved List of Models and Manufacturers' to protect and encourage domestic manufacturing.The measure, introduced in 2021, is a non-tariff barrier to boost domestic manufacturing by listing only local sellers to purchase modules from.",

Even now, our per capita emissions are one-third of world average, while that of developed countries is three times the world average, he said.  The developed countries used fossil fuels for developing their economies but they want to tell us that we should not use coal, he noted.   It is the developed countries that need to cut down their emissions first,  he said.  Singh emphasised that India is not going to make any compromise on the electricity needs for a growing (Indian) economy. We need to develop. At the same time, we will do that responsibly.   We were nine years ahead in achieving the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) target of having 40 per cent of installed power capacity from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030,  he said.   We pledged at COP-21 in 2015 that we will reduce our emissions intensity by 33 per cent by 2030; we did this by 2019,  he said.  So, in Glasgow, we have said by 2030, we will have 50 per cent of our capacity from renewables and that we will reduce our emission intensity by 45 per cent, he said.   We will achieve it. So, we are on target,  Singh added.  The availability of power in rural areas is now 21 hours and in urban areas, it is 23.5 hours, he stressed.",

        "articleBody": "The importance of fossil fuels in the near term cannot be underscored, and the developing countries need to balance their net zero targets with growth and fiscal metrics, said India's chief economic advisor, V Anantha Nageswaran, Thursday. \u201cDeveloping countries need affordable and reliable energy for economic growth, which in turn is necessary for energy transition,  the CEA said at a seminar hosted by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP).The CEA pointed out that the calculations for net zero needed to take into account the relocation and labour displacement costs.\u201cNobody is saying it (transition) is not imperative, but it is important to be realistic about what we want to do and in what time frame and the trade-offs,\u201d he stated.India has set a target of net zero by 2070.The CEA noted that investments in the oil and gas sector had peaked prematurely, which are expected to create demand-supply gaps and keep prices elevated for some time. \u201cThis will continue to pose economic burden, depriving countries of growth and domestic resource generation. Therefore, excessive reliance on external capital, which also will have implication of current account balance,\u201d he said.The CEA in the paper co-authored with Gulzar Natarajan, secretary, Finance Department, Government of Andhra Pradesh, has pointed out the Impossible Trinity of Net Zero, which entails that countries can only pursue two of the three goals, viz, \u201cNet Zero\u201d transition, fiscal sustainability and economic competitiveness, at any given time.According to the paper, a commitment to carbon neutrality will entail a higher cost of energy and will undermine competitiveness and the country needs to sacrifice fiscal sustainability if carbon neutrality and economic competitiveness have to be preserved.\u201cThe transition involves trade-offs rather than a singular pursuit of energy transition alone as a pre-eminent goal of public policy,\u201d CEA said.The CEA also pointed to the need for recognition of public capital\u2019s role in energy transition, stating that private capital has not had a long history of creating public goods.\u201cBehavioural and attitude changes are required in the private capital space for this to become a viable reality for countries receiving capital and ensuring incentives for the private sector to come through.\u201dNatarajan laid down four broad areas of reform, saying that there was a need for the government to take the lead.He highlighted the importance of inter-state dispute settlement mechanisms and said that there was a need to de-risk infrastructure financing, leverage SDRs to mobilise private finance, and lower the cost of capital by using blended finance or blended finance investments.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India is looking at potentially taxing high-carbon goods locally, and then using the proceeds to support its green energy transition, to avoid the European Union's carbon tax on imports, the country's trade minister said on Thursday.  The EU's plan to impose a carbon levy from 2026 on high-carbon goods such as steel and iron ore, approved in April, has drawn concerns from India and the two sides are holding talks to discuss the issue. Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said there would be no additional levy if the exporting nation taxes carbon locally.  We will find a solution around a domestic tax to take care of equating with European taxes on carbon emissions,  he said at an industry event.  So if we collect the tax in India itself and use it for our green energy transition, which will indirectly help the same companies that are exporters as they transition to cleaner energy and bring down their cost, there will be no additional CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) tax.

        "articleBody": "In the NCR areas of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Sunday called for the Centre to impose a stringent ban on buses running on subpar diesel. The minister discovered that all buses registered in these areas were BS III and BS IV vehicles during an unexpected examination at the Kashmere Gate interstate bus terminal.  Vehicular emissions account for a significant portion of Delhi's air pollution. While buses in Delhi operate only on compressed natural gas and electricity, those belonging to the neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan are BS III and BS IV vehicles,  PTI quoted Rai. Directions issued by the Centre's Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) state that from November 1, only electric, CNG, and BS VI-compliant diesel buses will be permitted to operate between Delhi and the cities and towns in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan that are included in the National Capital Region, or NCR, news agency PTI reported.  While the CAQM has issued strict directions in this regard, we demand that the Centre implement a complete ban on BS III and BS IV buses being operated in NCR areas of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan,  Rai said. The Centre declared in April 2020 that all cars sold in India would have to meet Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) emission regulations in an attempt to lower pollution levels.Legal restrictions on the quantity of air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter, that Indian cars are permitted to release are imposed by the Bharat Stage emission regulations. The enhancement of engine design, fuel economy, and pollution control are the main goals of these regulations.Oil firms provide fuel that complies with BS-VI requirements, which is said to as the world's cleanest fuel, while vehicle manufacturers provide cars that fit these new regulations.(With inputs from PTI)",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s industrial leaders are increasingly preoccupied with decarbonisation. It is a vast topic, covering issues as diverse as carbon accounting and renewable energy procurement. But there is one aspect that often gets overlooked: energy efficiency.Partly, this may be because there is little awareness of the potential gains to be made from using energy more efficiently. But the reality is that they could be significant. The Energy Efficiency Movement (EEM) has just published an executive guide with ten actions that, if deployed across the world\u2019s industrial base, could save 11 per cent of the global carbon emissions forecast for 2030.Called The Case for Industrial Energy Efficiency, the guide builds on an Industrial Energy Efficiency Playbook published by the EEM in 2022 and provides a roadmap to deliver financial savings of more than $437 billion across the world\u2019s industrial enterprises.The figure is based on modelling that incorporates the best available data and includes input from subject matter experts at leading industrial players, including ABB, Alfa Laval and Microsoft. Expert advice was also provided by the IEA.The actions range from the simple and obvious, such as carrying out an energy audit and making sure machinery is correctly sized and powered for its intended applications, to the complex and ambitious, such as using intelligent building management systems and moving data storage and processing into the cloud. Ways to improve efficiency todayThey are all measures that can be carried out today\u2014and in many cases, will start delivering returns almost immediately. In India, for example, 70% of electricity consumed by industry is from motor-driven systems, yet less than 15% of motors produced in India are energy-efficient IE3 or IE4 models. Since moving from IE2 to IE4-standard motors reduces loss by an average of 42%, upgrading the 85% of motors that are still at IE2 efficiency standards or below could have a major financial impact on industrial players. EEM modelling shows the global industry could save almost $72 billion a year simply by adopting more efficient motors. Thus, embracing higher efficiency motors isn't merely a preference; it's a collective responsibility towards industries, the environment, and India\u2019s sustainable future.The Case for Industrial Energy Efficiency contains three actions in particular\u2014connecting assets, installing heat pumps, and creating smarter buildings\u2014that alone could deliver 70 per cent of energy efficiency savings available to global industry by 2030.A timely guide to address a new regulatory environmentThe tool comes as India\u2019s industrial leaders face a daunting task over the next couple of decades. On one hand, they will need to keep pace with industrial growth that hit 10.3 per cent on an annual basis in August 2023. On the other hand, they will have to sustain that growth while undergoing deep transformations to decarbonise their operations. This second point is no longer up for discussion.Apart from a growing social imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, underscored by climate trends that threaten 2.2 billion people on the Indian subcontinent, industrial players are increasingly having to consider carbon pricing as part of production. Lawmakers are mulling emissions reduction targets for companies in the cement, petrochemicals, iron and steel, and pulp and paper industries as part of a national carbon market launching in 2025, Reuters reported in September. Meanwhile, seven export sectors, including steel, cement, and hydrocarbons, are already having to report on their emissions to comply with the European Union\u2019s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is expected to result in up to a 35 per cent tax on imports into the EU from January 2026.For India\u2019s industrial giants, this new regulatory reality looks like a lose-lose situation. Either they make heavy investments in decarbonisation, which will drive up costs, or they face steep taxes on export goods, which will also hit profits. But there is a way they can reduce emissions and save money at the same time: by saving energy. Accessing these benefits is not hard, and it starts with becoming aware of just how much energy efficiency can be achieved.To find out more, visit www.energyefficiencymovement.com for your free copy of The Case for Industrial Energy Efficiency.Author:104697591Mike Umiker is the managing director of the Energy Efficiency Movement, a forum that brings together more than 400 like-minded global stakeholders, including major companies such as Accenture, DHL, Microsoft, and Tata Steel, to innovate and act for a more energy-efficient world.Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of ABB Group's 'The Energy Efficiency Movement' initiative by The Times Internet\u2019s Spotlight team.",

All countries are suggesting work programmes and India has suggested collaboration on biofuels like the G20 Alliance,  said an official, adding that India is also pushing for technology transfer through joint ventures in the clean energy pillar.104632985Supported by the G20 countries and 12 global organisations, including World Bank, Asian Development Bank, International Energy Agency and the International Energy Forum, the Global Biofuels Alliance seeks to strengthen global biofuels trade. It was launched at the New Delhi G20 Leaders Summit.The current round of IPEF talks ends on October 24.Pillar 3 relates to environmental issues, how to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in various industries, carbon capture utilisation and storage, collaborative financing facilitate trading and not put many barriers.Negotiations on Pillar 3 (clean economy) and Pillar 4 (fair economy) are expected to conclude in the ongoing round.The IPEF was launched jointly by the US and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, Australia and seven ASEAN members. It is structured around four pillars-trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues such as tax and anti-corruption).The IPEF Supply Chains (Pillar-II) Agreement was finalised in May and the commerce and industry ministry has floated a cabinet note seeking approval to sign and ratify it. Since the IPEF talks are likely to conclude next month, culminating in a ministerial meeting, Cabinet approval for Pillar 2 needs to come before that,  the official added.Pillar 3 also has labour issues and talks about indigenous people, but India is unlikely to partake in it as the country doesn't define indigenous people.",

It is to inform that the two Aggregator schemes namely Delhi Motor Vehicle Aggregator and Delivery Service Provider Scheme 2023 and Delhi Motor Vehicles Licensing of Aggregator (Premium Buses) Scheme, 2023, which were published in May 2023 for public feedback are now in their final stage,  Gahlot said in a post on 'X'.The Delhi Motor Vehicle Aggregator and Delivery Service Provider Scheme aims to establish guidelines for ride-hailing and delivery service aggregators so that it can completely transition to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030.It also aims to introduce regulatory provisions for bike taxis and rent-a-bike services. Once the scheme is cleared, aggregators need to gradually convert their fleets to electric.The Delhi EV Policy aims to achieve the overarching objective of improving Delhi's air quality and creating an entire supply-chain ecosystem for this new segment of vehicles. In order to significantly benefit Delhi's air quality, the policy intends to deploy 25% of all new vehicles to be battery-operated vehicles by 2024. ",

        "articleBody": "The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved the project on Green Energy Corridor (GEC) Phase-II - Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) for 13 gigawatt renewable energy project in Ladakh.The project is targeted to be set up by financial 2029-30 with a total estimated cost of Rs 20,773.70 crore and central financial assistance at 40 per cent of the project cost - Rs 8,309.48 crore.Keeping in view the complex terrain, adverse climatic conditions and defence sensitivities of the Ladakh region, Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) will be the implementing agency for this project.The transmission line for evacuating this to-be-produced power will pass through Himachal Pradesh and Punjab up to Kaithal in Haryana, where it will be integrated with the national grid.An interconnection is also planned from this project in Leh to the existing Ladakh grid so as to ensure a reliable power supply to Ladakh. It will also be connected to the Leh-Alusteng-Srinagar line to provide power to Jammu and Kashmir. The project will entail setting up of 713 km transmission lines (including 480 km HVDC line) and 5 GW capacity of HVDC terminal each at Pang (Ladakh) and Kaithal (Haryana),  the government said in a release.The project will contribute to achieving the target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity target from non-fossil fuels by the year 2030.Prime Minister Modi, during his Independence Day Speech in 2020, announced the setting up of a 7.5 GW solar Park in Ladakh.After an extensive field survey, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) prepared a plan to set up a 13 GW renewable energy generation capacity along with a 12 GWh battery energy storage system in Pang, Ladakh.Keeping in mind the rising demands for energy and to meet its target of achieving 50 per cent of the needs through renewable energy, the central government in early September decided to provide viability gap funding to companies for setting up battery energy storage systems.India aims to meet its 50 per cent energy needs through renewable sources by 2030.The government will spend Rs 3,760 crore as viability gap funding and it will be a 100 per cent central grant. The viability gap funding is capped at 40 per cent of the total capital cost of the project.Viability gap funding is given to support infrastructure projects that are economically justified but fall marginally short of finances.At the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had committed to an ambitious five-part  Panchamrit  pledge, including reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, to generate half of all energy requirements from renewables, to reduce emissions by 1 billion tons by 2030.India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070.India meets a sizable portion of its energy needs through imports, and new energy sources are seen as an avenue to reduce the dependence on imported fuel.

        "articleBody": "The government will bring out another production-linked incentive scheme for batteries to bring down cost and boost the adoption of electric vehicles in India, union minister R K Singh said on Monday. Speaking at the EV (electric vehicles) Ready India Dashboard of OMI Foundation, the Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister said,  We are coming out with another production-linked incentive (PLI) to increase the volumes (of storage or battery).   He was of the view that the price of storage will come down with (higher) volumes.  Price of storage will come down only if you add volumes. That is why there is a production-linked incentive (PLI) for storage,  he said.  He pointed towards limited battery manufacturing capacity in the world and termed it as a reason for high prices.  The minister opined that higher cost and lower driving range are issues in adopting EVs.  The central government had approved the (PLI) scheme for manufacturing advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries at an estimated outlay of Rs 18,100 crore in May 2021, with an objective to attract foreign and domestic investment of Rs 45,000 crore.  The scheme was aimed to achieve manufacturing of 50GW of battery storage.  The ACCs are the new generation of advanced storage technologies that can store electric energy either as electrochemical or as chemical energy and convert it back to electric energy as and when required.   For us as a country switching to electric mobility is of absolute importance. One rider to emerge as a power (economy), is that you cannot be energy dependent. That is our primary reason to push towards EV,  the minister said.  Singh pointed out that transition to EVs will reduce emissions in India.  He stated that 80 per cent of lithium resources are tied up by one country and 88 per cent of processing of lithium is also in one country.  He stated,  We are lucky that we have some lithium reserves in Jammu.   He suggested the need to shift away from lithium to other chemistry (of batteries).   The research is going on in sodium ions. If that works fine. Alternative chemistry is absolutely essential. Once you have alternative chemistry, you have security of the supply chain (of storage). Supply chain issues are strategic issues,  he said.  Singh also pointed towards high power demand of 16 per cent in the first fortnight of October.   My power demand is growing hugely. In August the (power) demand grew at 20 per cent as compared to August last year. In September it again grew at 20 per cent. In October, the past fourteen days, it has grown by about 16 per cent,  he said.  He also stated that the Indian economy is the fastest growing large economy in the world and will continue to be so in the next two or three decades.   Last year we grew at 7.3 per cent. This year we are growing at 6.3 per cent and my assessment is that we will continue growing at 7.5 to 7.8 per cent. So the rate of growth will increase and will not plateau,  he said.  India's installed power generation capacity is 425 GW and it will grow to 800GW by 2030 because my (India's) demand is going to double by 2030, the minister informed.  The minister also said that India's non-fossil fuel-based installed power generation capacity is 185GW which is 43 per cent to the total (425GW).  He stressed that by 2030, India shall have 65 per cent of our capacity coming from non-fossil fuel based power.  We have pledged that by 2030, we will reduce our emission intensity by 45 per cent. We will cross that (achievement) as well,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "India has set an ambitious target of achieving net zero emissions by 2070. To meet this objective, India has pledged to, inter alia, achieve 500 GW of installed electricity (about 50 per cent of cumulative installed power) from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 as part of its NDCs under COP26. It is a tall order for a country which currently has a total renewable energy capacity of 176.49 GW [1]. As a step towards meeting the targeted capacity addition, in April 2023, the Government declared the bidding trajectory for renewable energy by announcing its decision to invite bids of 50 GW of renewable energy annually for the next five years to complement capacities being developed under other schemes of the Government and States, as well as commercial and industrial segments under the open access regime. This announcement was swiftly followed by a notification of revised guidelines by the Ministry of Power in July and August on tariff based competitive bidding process for the procurement of power from grid connected solar, wind and hybrid sources (Revised Guidelines) [2] in supersession of the guidelines issued in 2017. The Revised Guidelines are intended to introduce fairness, transparency and efficiency in the bidding process to provide impetus to private sector participation.One of the key changes introduced by the Revised Guidelines is reduction in standard term of power purchase agreement (PPA) from 25 years to 20 years. The impact of such change on the tariff landscape will be clear only after the bids are awarded under the Revised Guidelines, as generators may want to increase tariff to maintain financial viability of projects consequent to reduction in tenure of the PPA.Another important change is the inclusion of solar projects with energy storage system (ESS) within the ambit of the Revised Guidelines, which was conspicuously absent in the erstwhile guidelines. This, along with the National Framework for promoting energy storage systems issued in August 2023, is aimed at improving energy security and grid stability by encouraging development of round the clock projects, either through development of ESS by the generator itself or in collaboration with developers of ESS.To broaden the bidder base, the minimum bid capacity has been reduced to 10 MW from 50 MW, with award to a single bidder being capped at 50 per cent of the capacity available for allocation under a bid document. The Revised Guidelines also permit existing players with untied capacity to participate in these bids. The aim is to incentivise generators to invest in capacity expansion of existing projects, which was previously restricted under several power purchase agreements (PPA), leading to multiple disputes between generators and procurers.Recognising that the cost of setting up of renewable energy projects has come down significantly from the earlier prohibitive levels, viability gap funding has now been done away with as a bidding parameter. Bids will now be invited only on the basis of fixed tariff. This will also ensure that viability gap assistance is available to other sectors such as ESS, which require such funding support.The timelines for the completion of bidding process have been streamlined to ensure that awarding and implementation of projects happen in a timely manner. The procurers are required to approach the appropriate electricity regulatory commission (ERC) for adoption of tariff within 15 days of discovery of tariff and relief for delay in adoption of tariff by ERC beyond the stipulated period is required to be mandatorily granted to generators through extension of scheduled supply commencement date, which would go a long way in ensuring that generators are not penalised for delayed receipt of regulatory approvals.Unlike the erstwhile regime where penalties for not meeting the minimum generation obligation were linked to non-fulfilment of renewable purchase obligation of the procurers, leading to unnecessary disputes, the Revised Guidelines have brought in much needed clarity by specifying the quantum of penalty in such cases. While the right of first refusal of procurers to purchase excess generation has been retained, much to the relief of generators, procurers are now required to pay the agreed tariff for purchase of such excess power instead of reduced rate of 75 per cent of tariff.Other notable changes include increased timelines for commissioning to factor in challenges faced in land acquisition for large scale projects, penalties for delayed commissioning, including debarment to ensure that bidders do not deliberately delay projects to take advantage of changing market conditions, and award of bids on a bucket filling basis to bidders quoting within the range of 2-5% of the lowest discovered tariff to ensure tariffs discovered in the bidding process are sustainable. India\u2019s energy transition goal can only be realised with significant capacity addition over the coming years. Continued policy support and increased participation from the private sector is pivotal for the country to realise its renewable energy commitment. The Revised Guidelines is a step in the right direction and together with the Government\u2019s focus on augmenting transmission infrastructure to support the increase in non-fossil fuel sources as part of its energy mix, India will be able to realise its vision of being a pioneer in energy transition.[This piece was written by Ajay Sawhney and Aditi Mishra, Partners at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas]References:1 Press Information Bureau (pib.gov.in)2 2023 Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement from Grid Connected Solar PV Power Projects (July 28, 2023); 2023 Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement from Grid Connected Wind Power Projects (July 26, 2023) and 2023 Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement from Grid Connected Wind Solar Hybrid Power Projects (August 21, 2023).",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Indian oil companies are targeting net zero by 2046 as they decarbonise operations to cut emissions and transition to cleaner fuels, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday. While India has pledged net zero carbon emissions by 2070, state-owned companies have set targets ranging from 2038 (ONGC) to 2046 (IOC).  Indian energy sector is on the cusp of a transition and is rapidly moving towards the centre of global oil and energy market as we are set to become a USD 5 trillion economy,  Puri said, addressing the 26th Energy Technology Meet here.  India's energy demand, he said, will continue to provide fuel for future economic growth. India is the world's 3rd largest consumer of oil, 3rd largest LPG consumer, 4th largest LNG importer, 4th largest refiner, and 4th largest automobile market. The country is likely to account for 25 per cent of global energy demand growth over the next two decades, he said. While the oil demand grows, Indian companies have set ambitious net zero emission targets. The transition, he said, will be a gradual shift from fossil fuels to cleaner fuels and renewables. The minister said high oil prices accelerate the energy transition. On the Israel-Palestine conflict, he said India is watching the situation closely. Oil prices rose over USD 3 a barrel on Monday following military clashes between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.  So far as energy is concerned, let us be absolutely clear that the place where the action is taking place is in many respects the centre of global energy. We will watch very carefully as we go along, we will navigate our way through this,  he said. Talking about biofuel in India, he said,  We reached the target of 10 per cent ethanol blending five months beforehand. Now we are at 12 per cent, and the target of 20 per cent by 2025 can be achieved easily . India today is the 4th largest refiner having a refining capacity of 254 million tonnes per annum after the United States, China and Russia. This refining capacity is further being increased to 310 million tonnes by 2028 with a view to becoming a major refining hub for exports of refinery products. On the recently launched Global Biofuels Alliance, he said this presents a USD 500 billion opportunity globally as the less polluting fuel is taken up globally.",

        "articleBody": "The president of the upcoming COP28 climate talks in Dubai called on Sunday for governments to abandon  fantasies  such as hastily ditching existing energy infrastructure in pursuit of climate goals. We cannot unplug the energy system of today before we build the new system of tomorrow. It is simply not practical or possible,  Sultan Al Jaber said during the opening session of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Climate Week, a UN-organised conference hosted in the Saudi capital Riyadh. We must separate facts from fiction, reality from fantasies, impact from ideology, and we must ensure that we avoid the traps of division and distraction. Much of international climate diplomacy revolves around the thorny issue of how and when to quit fossil fuels.At COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, countries agreed to phase down  unabated coal , the first time a fossil fuel was explicitly mentioned in a final text.But efforts since then to extend such a target to all fossil fuels have foundered, most recently at last month's G20 summit in India.Climate activists have criticised the appointment of Jaber to lead the COP28 talks which kick off in Dubai in November, given that he is also head of the Emirati state-owned oil firm ADNOC.But Jaber has garnered the support of COP parties including US climate envoy John Kerry, partly by emphasising his belief that  the phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable .Energy officials in the United Arab Emirates and other oil-producing countries -- notably Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter -- have argued for continued investments in fossil fuels to ensure energy security even as they eye an eventual transition away from them.The vast and fractured landscape of climate finance is the other major stumbling block in climate negotiations.Developing countries least responsible for climate change are seeking money from richer polluters to adapt to its increasingly destructive and expensive consequences.In 2009, rich countries pledged to supply $100 billion of climate finance every year to developing nations but failed to meet the 2020 deadline. There are hopes the goal will be met this year. Old promises must be kept, including the $100 billion pledge made over a decade ago,  Jaber said on Sunday.Last year's COP27 talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, ended with the first ever creation of a  loss and damage  fund into which countries would pay to support poorer nations suffering the most from more intense and frequent storms, floods and droughts.The fund's operation, governance, location, contributors, beneficiaries and a timeline for payouts are all up in the air ahead of COP28. We must make the fund for loss and damage that was promised in Sharm el-Sheikh a reality in Dubai,  Jaber said.The talks in Riyadh are intended to  shine a spotlight on challenges and solutions in a region that is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change,  organisers said in a press release on Sunday.The region must already grapple with high temperatures and water scarcity, with more than 60 percent of the population having  very little if any access to potable water , the statement said. Increasing temperatures are predicted to lead to more persistent and acute drought,  it added.Jaber also highlighted challenges facing the region, referring to extreme events like hurricane-strength Storm Daniel, which last month caused two dams in eastern Libya to burst and flood the city of Derna. Climate change isn't a threat waiting around the corner -- the MENA region knows this from first-hand experience with fierce heatwaves and water shortages,  said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme.Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, said the region was  at a crossroads, facing not only the devastating impacts of climate change but also the challenge of transitioning their economies to ensure prosperity in a 1.5C aligned world. The goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was set at the 2015 climate talks in Paris.",

This plan involves creating separate pools for different types of renewable energy projects, such as solar, wind, and hybrid, based on their technologies. The weighted average of tariffs from these pools will be determined and could be revised monthly. ",

        "articleBody": "The government is in the process of finalising procedures to pool tariffs of renewable energy capacities that are auctioned through designated agencies, which will help make the electricity tariff uniform for power distribution companies.The plan is to create separate pools for solar, wind, hybrid, and other projects based on the technologies for around five years, people aware of the development told ET. A weighted average of the tariffs from the capacities in the pool will be determined, which could be revised monthly, they said.  Final modalities are being worked out now, while guidelines have already been issued,  one of the persons said.The power ministry had in January amended the Electricity Rules to facilitate the tariff pooling mechanism.In the pooling system, renewable energy implementing agencies will procure renewable power and supply to distribution companies at a uniform tariff. This will not have any impact on the tariffs for the renewable energy developers.This means all upcoming projects and those where power purchase agreements have not been signed will be bundled.With the pooling, the incentive or disincentive for distribution companies to refuse a power purchase agreement goes away, the person quoted above said. When tariffs of solar and wind projects were falling with each auction, distribution companies delayed or cancelled signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) in anticipation of rates declining further, which also delayed the projects.  To avoid non-signing of PPAs for projects which have higher tariff in auctions, pooling has been decided,  the person said.However, solar energy tariffs discovered in auctions by central agencies have risen in the last few months. While the discovered solar tariffs in the last six months have been higher, with module prices falling in the last few months, there is a possibility of tariffs dropping again,  said Vikram Reddy V, sector head and vice president, ICRA Ltd.Grid Controller of India is likely to be the nodal agency for the pooling of tariff. States can continue to tender renewable energy capacities on their own, but it is likely that many would opt for the central pooling system. This is because capacities tendered through agencies like Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd, NTPC Ltd, NHPC Ltd and SJVN Ltd get better rates with bulk capacities. Renewable energy developers also prefer bidding for such projects because of assured payments, a second person said.What also makes pooling imperative is that states need to tie up for new capacities as power demand has increased substantially this year, and is likely to continue growing, the person said. The downside of tariff pooling is that discoms are exposed to a variable rate as tariffs are updated periodically, a government official said. The government had in April announced it would invite bids for 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for the next five years starting FY24. The bids for inter-state transmission-connected renewable energy capacity will include wind power capacity of at least 10 GW per year.",

Companies would have to seek compliance certificates from the EU authorities to comply with the CBAM norms.However, the full implementation of CBAM is scheduled for January 2026 and the mechanism would then translate into a 20-35% tax on select imports into the EU. We are awaiting clarity on how certification will be done after the audit of the carbon footprint of when it comes into effect in October,  said EEPC India chairman Arun Kumar Garodia.India's exports to the EU in 2022-23 amounted to $74.8 billion, with mineral fuels, electrical machinery and iron and steel being the top products. In 2022, 27% of India's exports of iron, steel and aluminium products worth $8.2 billion went to the EU.On its part, the government has insisted that India's version of carbon credits should get internationally recognised on solar and green technology to balance out the impact of such rules. India has asked the EU to recognise its Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, pushed for mutual recognition of its carbon certificates with the EU and carve outs for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Talks are on with the EU to either postpone the implementation and exclude MSMEs,  said an official, adding that Japan is also opposed to CBAM.While CBAM has no exemptions for MSMEs, carve outs for small businesses are crucial as 40-45% of the affected companies in these sectors are MSMEs, the official said. They had exemptions in the EU's earlier Emission Trading System.",

Gadkari said that the actions being taken are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitions of making India a carbon neutral country by 2047. In May, Gadkari had pitched the idea for road making companies to switch to using alternative fuel power construction equipment and save costs.Speaking at the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI's) International Conference on Tunnel Construction on Wednesday, he had said,  Diesel machinery should be discouraged. Electricity, methanol, and ethanol powered construction equipment can save costs. Sharing the estimates, he had said that around a tenth of the cost of construction in highways is used just in running diesel powered equipment.He also spoke about the substandard detailed project reports (DPRs) prepared by Indian companies and called for improving them. Gadkari said he was open to the idea of encouraging international companies in making DPRs for Indian road projects to reduce accidents and speed up decision making.Speaking later in the day at the Annual Flagship Infrastructure Conference and Awards organised by Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), he said that there should be efforts to reduce the use of steel and cement.  The cost of highway construction should come down with use of modern technologies,  Gadkari said. We are making logistic parks worth Rs 2 lakh crore. That is an investment avenue. Development of road side smart cities, villages, and logistic parks is being planned. Joint venture partners are being sought for setting up industrial clusters,  he had earlier said.",

        "articleBody": "Melbourne: In 2022, the burning of fossil fuels provided 82 per cent of the world's energy. In 2000, it was 87 per cent. Even as renewables have undergone tremendous growth, they've been offset by increased demand for energy. That's why the United Nations earlier this month released a global stocktake - an assessment on how the world is going in weaning itself off these energy-dense but dangerously polluting fuels. Short answer: progress, but nowhere near enough, soon enough. If we consult history, we find that energy transitions are not new. To farm fields and build cities, we've gone from relying on human or animal muscle to wind and water to power sailboats and mill grain. Then we began switching to the energy dense hydrocarbons, coal, gas and oil. But this can't last. We were first warned in 1859 that when burned, these fuels add to the Earth's warming blanket of greenhouse gases and threatening our liveable climate. It's time for another energy transition. We've done it before. The problem is time - and resistance from the old energy regime, fossil fuel companies. Energy historian Vaclav Smil calculates past energy transitions have taken 50-75 years to ripple through societies. And we no longer have that kind of time, as climate change accelerates. This year is likely the hottest in 120,000 years. So can we learn anything from past energy transitions? As it happens, we can.  Until around 1880, the world ran on wood, charcoal, crop residue, manure, water and wind. In fact, some countries relied on wood and charcoal throughout the 20th century - even as others were shifting from coal to oil. The English had used coal for domestic heating from the time of the Romans because it burned longer and had nearly double the energy intensity of wood. So what drove the shift? Deforestation was a part. The reliance on wood worked while there were trees. In the pre-industrial era, cities of 500,000 or more needed huge areas of forests around them. In some locales wood seemed boundless, free and expendable. The costs to biodiversity would become apparent only later.  Britain was once carpeted in forest. Endemic deforestation drove the change to coal in the 16th and 17th centuries. Most English coal pits opened between 1540 and 1640. When the English figured out how to use coal to make steam and push a piston, it made even more possible - pumping water from deepening mining pits, the invention of locomotives, and transporting produce, including the feed needed by working animals. Yet for all this, coal had only reached 5 per cent of the global market by 1840. In North America, coal didn't overtake wood until as late as 1884 - even as crude oil became more important. Why did America first start exploiting oil reserves? In part to replace expensive oil from the heads of sperm whales. Before hydrocarbon oil was widely available, whaling was depended upon for lubricants and some lighting. In 1846, the US had 700 whaling vessels scouring the oceans for this source of oil. Crude oil was struck first in Pennsylvania in 1859. To extract it required drilling down 21 metres. The drill was powered by a steam engine - which may have been fired by wood.  The 19th century energy transition took decades. It wasn't a revolution so much as a steady shift. By the end of that century, global energy supply had doubled and half of it was from coal. When they were first invented in 1712, steam engines converted just 2 per cent of coal into useful energy. Almost 150 years later they were still highly inefficient at just 15 per cent. (Petrol-powered cars still waste about 66 per cent of the energy in their fuel). Even so, steam sped up early proto-industries such as textiles, print production and traditional manufacturing. But the engines did not free us from the yoke. In fact, early coal mining actually increased demand for human labour. Boys as young as six worked at lighter tasks. Conditions were generally horrific. Alongside human muscle was animal strength. Coal was often raised from pits by draft horses. In 1850s New England, steam was three times more expensive than water flows powering textile mills. Vaclav Smil has shown industrial waterwheels and turbines  competed successfully with steam engines for decades . The energy of flowing water was free. Digging up coal was labor-intensive. Why did steam win? Human ecologist Andreas Malm argues what really drove the shift to steam-powered mills was capital. Locating steam engines in urban centres made it easier to concentrate and control workers, as well as overcoming worker walk-outs and machine breaking. The question of who does the work is often overlooked. When energy historians refer vaguely to human muscle, we should ask: whose muscles? Was the work done by slaves or forced labourers? Even in the current energy transition there can be gross disparities between employer and worker. As heat intensifies, some employers are giving ice vests to their migrant workers so they can keep working. That's reminiscent of coal shovelers in the furnace-like stokeholes of steam ships being immersed in ice-baths on collapse, as historian On Barak has shown.  As Vaclav Smil points out,  every transition to a new energy supply has to be powered by the intensive deployment of existing energies and prime movers . In fact, Smil argues the idea of the  industrial revolution  is misleading. It was not sudden. Rather, it was  gradual, often uneven . History may seem like it unfolds neatly. But it doesn't at all. In earlier transitions, we see overlaps. Hesitation. Sometimes, more intense use of earlier energy sources. They start as highly localised shifts, depending on available resources, before new technologies spreads along trade routes. Ultimately market forces have driven - or hindered - adoption. Time is short. But on the plus side, there are market forces now driving the shift to clean energy. Once solar panels and wind turbines are built, sunlight and wind are free. It is the resistance of the old guard - fossil fuel corporations - that is holding us back.  (This article is syndicated by PTI from The Conversation)",

        "articleBody": "Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh on Monday said India will achieve its 500 GW renewable energy target before the 2030 deadline. Addressing FICCI's India Energy Transition Summit 2023, Singh also said had India not lost two years due to COVID-19, the nation would have achieved 50 per cent of its power generation capacity from RE non-fossil fuels, by now.  India has 424 GW of power generation capacity which includes around 180 GW from non-fossil fuels and another 88 GW is in the works, the minister said.  The country has a target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.   We will achieve 500 GW of renewable energy (RE) well before 2030,  he said.  Singh also said India's energy transition programme is at the top in the world. The RE capacity addition is the fastest in the world.  New and Renewable Energy Secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said India added 15 GW of renewable energy in the last fiscal year (2022-23) which would be increased to 25 GW in 2023-24 and further to 40 GW in 2024-25.  He also said 50 GW of RE projects would go for bidding annually from this year onwards.  The minister noted that despite constituting 17 per cent of the world's population, India contributes only 4 per cent to the global carbon dioxide load.  The minister further emphasised that India's per capita emissions are approximately 2.2 tonnes, significantly lower than the global average of 6.3 tonnes, accentuating the country's responsible energy consumption habits.  The minister underscored the government's commitment to environmental stewardship.  He affirmed that India is the only major global economy whose energy transition actions are aligned with limiting the global temperature rise to under two degrees Celsius.  Moreover, he also mentioned India's achievement of all its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) nearly a decade earlier than committed.  Subhrakant Panda, President of FICCI and Managing Director of Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys said,  We will require investments upwards of Rs 20 trillion in transmission networks, evacuation infrastructure, and energy storage system, among others.   Shivanand Nimbargi, Chair of FICCI Renewable Energy CEOs Council and Managing Director & CEO of Ayana Renewable Power, expressed unwavering confidence in India's trajectory towards renewable energy targets.  He underlined that the path to 2070 required enormous financial investment.   We would be needing hundreds of gigawatts in terms of realizing our dream of net zero by 2070. And in terms of the investment itself, I think we are looking at a huge investment, something like 14 to 17 trillion USD between now and then , he added.  The event also saw the launch of the FICCI Deloitte report - India's energy-transition pathways: A net-zero perspective..  The report posits that India's final energy demand is expected to double to about 1200 Mtoe (Millions of tonnes of oil equivalent) by 2070 in a net-zero scenario with aggressive energy efficiency measures.  The report estimates India will require a massive USD 15 trillion investment to achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2070.  It highlights three fundamental pillars that anchor India's energy transition ambitions and are expected to address approximately 90 per cent of the nation's emissions.  These pillars are grid decarbonisation, industrial decarbonisation, and transport transition.  Dilip Oommen, Executive Vice President, Arcelor Mittal, and CEO, AM/NS India, stated that hydrogen as a viable but costly solution.  Oommen focused on reducing the cost of renewable energy, a key factor in green hydrogen production.  He also cited the potential of natural gas during the transition period and the role of carbon trading to incentivise green initiatives.",

        "articleBody": "Kolkata: As a measure to control rising pollution levels in the state because of automobile fuel emission, the West Bengal government has taken a decision to only use electric vehicles for all administrative functions. Even the vehicles taken on rent by the administration will also be electric vehicles only, as per a notification issued by the state Transport Department. The department has also drawn a rough estimate of the expenditure to be borne on this count. For the first 100 kilometers, the state government will bear a monthly expenditure of Rs 46,000 in the form of rent to the private agencies from where the car will be hired. After 100 kilometers, the rate will be Rs 8 for every extra kilometer. As per the notification, in case of emergencies, the administration will also be able to hire petrol-driven or diesel-driven vehicles. But a prior permission of the state Finance Department will be necessary for that.  Shifting to the new system will obviously involve extra cost and hence extra pressure on the state exchequer. But this is necessary to prevent the rising air pollution from the automobile fuel emission, especially that from the diesel-driven vehicles,  a senior Finance Department official said. The decision has been welcomed by the environment activists in the state, who claimed that the initiative is the right step in the right direction. However, the associations of private transport owners feel that although it is a welcome, they doubt how far the initiative will be successful in the long run without creating a proper infrastructure for the same.

The Delhi Electric Vehicles Policy-2020 expired on August 8 this year and the government had said that the subsidy being given under it would continue till a new policy gets notified.   We are moving a cabinet note and within this week it should be finalised. The existing policy will be extended for six months or until the new policy is notified,  he said.  Talking about the new policy that is in the works, the minister said the one thing that they will look at is the concept of retrofitting.   People want to convert their IC (internal combustion) engines into electric ones. The process is expensive. For converting a normal Gypsy, it takes almost Rs 5-6 lakh, which is on the higher side. We will look at how to incentivise it,  he told PTI.  Another focus area for the government is last-mile connectivity, he noted.   We have floated a tender for deploying 3,000 e-scooters and e-cycles to strengthen last-mile connectivity. In the first phase, 1,500 such vehicles will be stationed at metro stations. We are starting the project in Dwarka on a pilot basis,  he added.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sounded a clarion call for urgent climate action during the launch of the Climate Ambition Summit on Wednesday, emphasising the need to expedite the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Guterres'  no-nonsense summit  comes at a time when the world is reeling under the devastating impacts of climate change and probably the hottest year on record.  However, notable leaders from some of the world's largest polluting nations are conspicuously absent from the summit Guterres called to reinvigorate efforts to combat the climate crisis.  A list of 41 speakers put out by the UN for the morning session lacked representatives from China, the US, the UK or Japan.  Prominent nations addressing the summit include Austria, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, Pakistan, and South Africa.  In his impassioned speech, the UN secretary-general lamented the precious time lost due to foot-dragging, arm-twisting, and the relentless greed of fossil fuel giants who continue to profit from the planet's peril.  He demanded that major emitters, who have disproportionately benefited from fossil fuels, take extra measures to slash emissions and rich nations lend their unwavering support to emerging economies in their climate action.  Guterres' Acceleration Agenda set audacious benchmarks, urging developed countries to attain net-zero emissions as close to 2040 as possible, with emerging economies following suit by striving for net-zero emissions as close to 2050 as possible.  The secretary-general underscored the urgency of a fair, equitable, and just energy transition, which entails OECD countries exiting coal by 2030 and the rest of the world doing so by 2040.  He pulled no punches in insisting on the immediate cessation of fossil fuel subsidies, which astonishingly ballooned to USD 7 trillion in 2022, and the adoption of ambitious renewable energy targets in alignment with the 1.5-degree Celsius limit.  In his address, Guterres championed the cause of climate justice, empathising with the world's most impoverished nations who bear the brunt of a crisis they played no part in creating.  He called for a restoration of trust and implored governments to steer the global financial apparatus toward championing climate action.  His roadmap for progress encompasses pricing carbon, overhauling the operating models of multilateral development banks to attract private finance for developing nations, and the full operationalisation of the Loss and Damage Fund at COP28.  Guterres pressed developed countries to fulfil their USD 100 billion per year pledge to help developing countries implement their climate goals, replenish the Green Climate Fund, and double adaptation funding.  He also stressed the imperative of implementing a comprehensive early warning system worldwide by 2027.  A resolute Guterres urged businesses and financial institutions to walk the talk on genuine net-zero pathways, reprimanding disingenuous commitments and the obstructive tactics of certain corporations.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Sugar industry body ISMA on Wednesday demanded that the government should come out with a long term policy and formula for ethanol pricing in order to encourage mills to expand capacity by around 400 crore litre which will require an estimated investment of Rs 17,500 crore. Briefing media about the demand-supply scenario of sugar for the 2023-24 marketing year starting next month, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) President Aditya Jhunjhunwala also demanded that the minimum selling price of sugar should be enhanced to Rs 38 per kg from the current Rs 31 per kg in view of an increase in production cost.  He said the ISMA will come out with a fresh sugar production estimate for the 2023-24 marketing year (October-September) during November after analysing the satellite image of sugarcane area across major producing states and then only would be able to assess whether there is any surplus for exports after meeting the domestic demand of sugar and ethanol.   At present, the sugar industry has an installed capacity of 700 crore litre for ethanol production and we operate at 80 per cent capacity utilisation. We need to increase our installed capacity to 1,000-1,100 crore litre. This will require an estimated investment of Rs 17,500 crore,  Jhunjhunwala told reporters here.  To facilitate this huge investment and a healthy return on it, he said,  we need to have a long term ethanol pricing policy.   Jhunjhunwala said the government should devise some formula for fixation of ethanol price for blending with petrol.  He said the price of ethanol produced from sugarcane juice/syrup should be raised to Rs 69.85 per litre from about Rs 65 per litre now as the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugarcane has been increased by the government. FRP is the minimum price which mills have to pay to farmers for sugarcane purchase.  The ISMA president said that the ethanol blending has reached 11.76 per cent for the current ethanol supply year (December-November) as against the target of 12 per cent. The government aims to achieve 20 per cent ethanol blending with petrol by 2025.  In the current ethanol supply year, sugar mills would supply around 450 crore litre of ethanol to oil marketing companies (OMCs). Another 100 crore litre was supplied to alcohol and other industries.  Jhunjhunwala said the sugar industry needs to supply at least 800 crore litres of ethanol to boost the blending programme.  On demand-supply for sugar, the ISMA president asserted there is no shortage of sugar in the current 2022-23 marketing year, ending this month, and there would be no scarcity next marketing year.  In the next 2023-24 marketing year, ISMA has projected a sugar production estimate of 317 lakh tonnes after the diversion of 45 lakh tonnes for ethanol. The domestic demand is seen at 280 lakh tonnes. The opening stock will be around 55 lakh tonnes.  The production for the current marketing year is 328 lakh tonnes after the diversion of 42 lakh tonnes for ethanol. In 2022-23, the industry also exported 61 lakh tonnes of sugar, the entire quantity permitted by the food ministry.  Asked about export surplus for 2023-24, Jhunjhunwala said the industry would assess the production estimate in October-November to know about surplus sweetener for outward shipments.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The government is planning to make the national renewable purchase obligations (RPOs) enforceable under the Energy Conservation Act, which could draw  huge  penalties on entities for non-compliance.RPOs are mandated to purchase a minimum amount of renewable energy out of the total consumption by obligated entities, which include distribution companies, open-access consumers, and captive power producers. Though the central government announces the RPO trajectory for the country, the same are finalised by state regulatory commissions under The Electricity Act, 2003. The state electricity regulatory commissions are also responsible for ensuring compliance in their jurisdiction. The state regulators' trajectories may differ from those notified by the Centre. The shortfall in compliance by distribution utilities and the absence of stricter enforcement by the regulators for RPO are still major challenges for the renewable energy and power sectors, said a person aware of the development.103791489Bringing the mandates under the purview of the Energy Conservation Act will enable penalties on entities deviating from the central government's prescribed RPO trajectory, people in the know said. This will keep entities closer to complying with the central government's trajectory than state regulators with less chances of the target being deferred and carried over to the next year.No changes to the total RPO by the central government are expected, however, some modifications could be made in the specific renewable energy trajectories, another person said.Under the current trajectory of purchase obligations, the total portion of renewable energy is 43.3% of total electricity consumption in 2029-30.A report from Goldman Sachs in July said that though the government-mandated renewable purchase obligation is to cross 40% of overall consumption by FY30 it estimates overall renewable energy penetration to lag.The Energy Conservation Act, 2001, was amended in December by the Parliament enabling provisions to include vehicles, industrial units, and buildings, for specific energy consumption standards, among others.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV) on Tuesday urged the government to formulate a unified policy of road tax exemption for Electric Vehicles (EVs) across the country. In a letter to the Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, SMEV said a consistent and favourable policy environment is essential to accelerate the shift towards electric mobility in India.   I am writing to request your esteemed office to weigh in on a unified policy of road tax exemption for EVs that will play a pivotal role in encouraging the adoption of clean and sustainable transportation options, which is vital for our nation's environmental and economic future,  SMEV Chief Evangelist Sanjay Kaul wrote.  In July, SMEV had named Kaul as its Chief Evangelist to help revise the association's agenda.  In view of the Ministry of Heavy Industries' decision to reduce the subsidy component mid-way through the FAME II scheme, this input (unified policy of road tax exemption for EVs) from the government would become even more relevant and critical, he stated.  Road tax and registration fees aren't just bureaucratic formalities; they're pivotal factors influencing the rise or fall of EVs, Kaul said.   These fees can act as either a carrot or a stick, nudging consumers toward greener choices or pushing them back into the arms of traditional gas-guzzlers. EVs often carry a heftier price tag due to their advanced battery systems, so these extra upfront costs can be the tipping point that deters would-be buyers,  he said.  The patchwork of road tax policies across states is a roadblock to the EV revolution, Kaul said.  While some states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have already waived road tax and registration fees, others lag woefully behind, he wrote.   This uneven playing field doesn't just sow confusion; it actively discourages eager EV adopters, stalling the momentum of a market ready to shift into high gear.   Even more disheartening are states like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, who once enticed buyers with tax breaks only to backtrack and impose taxes, adding yet another hurdle in the race toward a sustainable future,  he noted.  Inconsistent tax policies across states are not merely confusing; they are crippling the EV movement in its tracks, Kaul stated.   What India needs now is a unified, favourable framework that supercharges our transition to electric mobility. A centralised advisory from your esteemed office can cut through the noise and set the stage for widespread adoption of this groundbreaking technology,  he added.  By issuing a nationwide advisory that advocates for a uniform policy on road tax exemptions for EVs, the government has a unique opportunity to drive India into a cleaner, greener future, he said.  Kaul has been tasked with helping the EV sector tide over the crisis faced since last year with almost all OEMs in the sector dealing with issues of non-compliance with policy details of the FAME II scheme.",

        "articleBody": "To break their 'two steps forward, one step back' routine on climate action, the Asia-Pacific needs to start delivering on ambitious emissions targets.  The Asia-Pacific's greenhouse gas emissions keep rising and in some respects the region is going backwards.  Climate action was the only Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 13) in which outcomes went backwards in the Asia-Pacific between 2015 and 2023.  Progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 13, taking  urgent action to address climate change , has been a case of two steps forward, one step back in the Asia-Pacific.  Over the past two years, countries in the Asia-Pacific have made strides: China and Indonesia have undertaken to transition their economies to net zero by 2060, Australia and most Southeast Asian countries by 2050.  China has massively invested in renewable energy. Indonesia has slowed deforestation, Vietnam has significantly expanded solar energy and Australia is aiming for more than 80 per cent of electricity to be renewable by 2030.  But a 2023 UN report said SDG 13 is  slipping away , and the Asia-Pacific was  both a victim ... and a perpetrator of climate change . There's work to do in getting SDG 13 back on track.  Climate finance has increased but falls short of what is needed for both mitigation and adaptation efforts. The financing gap is widening in emerging and developing economies due to discrepancies in financing cost.  For example, the estimated cost of capital for a solar PV panel in key emerging economies was between two and three times higher than in advanced economies and China.  The Asia-Pacific has vast potential to accelerate climate actions with strengthened collaboration. Increasing grid connectivity across Southeast Asian countries through the ASEAN Power Grid initiative can enhance energy security, increase efficiency of power procurement and increase renewable energy uptake.  Increasing knowledge sharing and capability development is also critical to progress in the region. For instance the ASEAN Green Future project, a collaboration between the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, Climateworks Centre and research groups across Southeast Asia, has shown coordinating to build and strengthen low-carbon value chains can catalyse a rapid transformation of Southeast Asia into a global low-carbon hub.  An informed and collective response will form the bedrock of future success. The Asia-Pacific's diverse economic landscapes and policy contexts can shape adaptation strategies, resilience building and emission reduction techniques.  In adaptation, as in mitigation, this knowledge exchange is pivotal, particularly in catalysing funding and policy support for the most vulnerable nations.  Climate change is leading to more intense and frequent extreme weather events, and there are severe vulnerabilities in the region, including sea level rise in the Pacific, and flooding and typhoons in tropical Asia.  A person living in Asia and the Pacific is six times more likely to be affected by disaster events than someone living outside the region, resulting in thousands of lives lost and millions of dollars of economic damages.  The number of lives lost in disasters is dwarfed by the deaths attributable to air pollution, much of it caused by burning coal.  Of the seven million premature deaths globally resulting from air pollution, more than four million were in Asia and the Pacific. Reducing reliance on coal helps mitigate climate change and also has an immediate health benefit for people living in the region.  While some countries make progress, others grapple with unique challenges.  Indonesia, for instance, stands at a pivotal juncture. The announcement at the G20 in 2020 of USD 20 billion dollars of finance to support a Just Energy Transition Partnership in Indonesia has, along with the global resources race fuelled by the United States' Inflation Reduction Act, created meaningful opportunities for the transition in Indonesia.  However, more policy reforms are needed to increase renewable energy uptake. Indonesia has significant capacity for solar power, but regulatory constraints make it very difficult to compete.  Given the urgent need to address climate change, the imperative is not only setting goals or targets, but delivering on them.  In Australia, targets supported by meaningful policy and economic incentives have been key to progress: electricity generation by renewable sources has grown by 167 per cent over 10 years, driven by meaningful policy and incentives to make those targets reality.",

        "articleBody": "The Indo-Pacific has much to lose as global events hinder international cooperation on sustainable development, but it also shows promising examples of success.  A handful of initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region show what can be achieved through international partnerships, even while fallout from global events hinders cooperation on development and climate action.  Global cooperation is the central theme of Sustainable Development Goal 17, but also the key to success across the other 16 goals.  The past year has shown why that success is so critical.  This year has seen the hottest summer on record, with average global temperatures projected to continue to rise, and more extreme weather conditions, including raging wildfires across the world. It is clear that the impacts of climate change have reached a breaking point.  These signs only further confirm what scientists have long warned us - that we have already passed several of the Earth's tipping points.  At the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, we are also far off track on achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and fulfilling the commitments agreed by member states for the Paris Agreement in 2015.  These challenges are particularly acute in many countries in the Indo-Pacific region and at the current rate, the region is on track to miss the 2030 SDG target by several decades.  The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and climate change and related natural disasters have resulted in a 'polycrisis' across the region, placing enormous pressure on government revenue and increasing the need for large stimulus spending.  This has resulted in elevated debt levels and inflation in many Asia-Pacific countries and rising inequalities.  In May 2022, Sri Lanka's government was forced to default on its debt for the first time and other countries in the region, such as the Maldives, Papua New Guinea and Tonga, are facing a high risk of debt distress.  The SDG financing gap, which globally is estimated at USD 4 trillion, has also widened significantly in many developing countries in the region. Indonesia, for example, saw a significant increase in the projected funding gap from USD 1.1 trillion (up to 2030) before the pandemic to USD 4.7 trillion in 2021.  Addressing these challenges by 2030 and beyond will require coordinated multi-stakeholder regional partnerships and cooperation to mobilise financing and human resources.  Sustainable Development Goal 17 cuts across all the goals and is foundational for achieving all of them.  It includes advancing multi-stakeholder and public-private partnerships, mobilising financial resources for developing countries, assisting countries in debt sustainability, increasing exports from developing countries, and deepening regional and international cooperation and capacity-building.  Achieving the goal is particularly critical for the Indo-Pacific region, where the economies of India and China are expected to account for nearly 75 per cent of the world's GDP growth this year.  Their growth will have significant negative international spillover effects over the rest of East and Southeast Asia, which hold an enormous amount of natural capital through trade.  Negative spillover effects are economic externalities passed across countries, such as environmental degradation, typically seen in developing countries when high-consumption, richer countries utilise their resources.  The Indo-Pacific region is home to more than 60 per cent of the world's population, and efforts towards decarbonisation and conservation of the region's vast forests and natural ecosystems - which transcend national borders - cannot be made by individual countries in isolation.  The intense geopolitical competition in the region has hampered climate cooperation between many of the countries. For instance, China, Japan, and South Korea - which together account for more than a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions - have each declared separate carbon-neutral goals.  Securing adequate climate financing also remains problematic. Financing large-scale regional green energy projects is often hampered by increased foreign exchange risks that limit local financial institutions' capacity to provide long-term loans.  Sovereign guarantees essential to removing financial risk from large-scale projects are more difficult to obtain due to sovereign debt risks in the region.  Additionally, poorer countries in the region, particularly Small Island Developing States, are often unable to borrow levels of capital sufficient to meet their long-term sustainable development needs, and they face high borrowing costs, short maturities on debts, and poor credit ratings.  However, recent initiatives at the regional, national, and subnational levels in support of goal 17 that improve climate cooperation and financing across countries show what's possible in the region.  In 2020, stakeholders endorsed the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation, which includes the ASEAN Power Grid to help produce and trade clean, cheap energy across the region.  Later that year, 15 countries, including members of ASEAN and five regional partners, signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, to promote trade in the region, resulting in arguably the world's largest free trade treaty.  The Belt and Road Initiative, an outbound infrastructure and investment initiative led by China, also has significant potential to promote global and regional cooperation on sustainable development, with more than 150 countries involved.  Yet, it faces debt and environmental sustainability challenges, and its success depends largely on deep policy reforms.  Australia's low emission technology partnerships with India, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, established as part of its efforts towards decarbonisation, have also shown promise.  At the national level, there are promising public-private partnerships to increase financing for Sustainable Development Goals in the region.  This has included the establishment of the SDG Indonesia One: Green Finance Facility, in partnership with the Asian Development Bank and Indonesia's Ministry of Finance.  It is the first green finance facility in Southeast Asia and aims to address the lack of a large-scale pipeline of bankable green infrastructure projects in the country.  The initiative has the potential to kickstart more than USD 1 billion in green projects with opportunities for replication in other Indo-Pacific countries.  Elsewhere, Singapore's Ministry of Finance and the country's Central Bank - the Monetary Authority of Singapore - have formed a network with seven other central banks worldwide to promote best practices and sharing in green finance with other countries.  Singapore's central bank and government have also established a 'Green Bond Grant' scheme to promote and ensure the issue of green bonds in Singapore.  These innovative financing partnerships and instruments are important for ensuring that financing solutions address both country and region-specific needs and vulnerabilities.  Improved partnerships and cooperation within the region between the public and private sectors can also further attract the capital and political support needed to fund critical sustainable development projects.  Countries could also take a collective approach to discussing solutions to broader international spillover impacts while acknowledging the private sector's role in curbing spillovers.  This can be a practical way to start valuing natural capital assets like air, water, soil, and energy while also making the global supply chain more resilient.  The Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures' framework offers potential for companies and financial institutions to integrate natural capital into their decision-making and risk management.  Despite the challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region, with integrated regional cooperation and increased financing, countries can accelerate the move to a decarbonised world and towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

        "articleBody": "The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved a viability gap funding scheme (VGF) to encourage companies to set up battery energy storage systems in the country, offering up to 40% of the capital cost of the project. The government has set aside Rs3,760 crore from this year's budget for the scheme aimed at creating 4,000 megawatt hours (MWh) battery energy storage systems (BESS) by 2030-31. India has planned to have 50% of its total energy share from non-fossil fuels by 2030. So, to make renewable energy more viable, we need to strengthen the BESS,  information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur said after the cabinet meeting.With the VGF support, the scheme aims to achieve a levelised cost of storage of Rs5.50-6.60 per unit, which will help in making stored renewable energy a viable option for managing peak power demand.The viability gap funds will be released in five tranches till 2030-31 and a minimum of 85% of the BESS project capacity will be made available to power distribution companies.Project developers would be selected through a competitive bidding process.The scheme was first announced in the union budget with an initial outlay of Rs9,400 crore.The scheme will boost the integration of renewable energy into the electricity grid, optimise utilisation of transmission networks, and reduce the need for costly infrastructure upgrades, the government said.The VGF scheme for the development of BESS is a much-required intervention for mobilising the first wave of such projects and enabling larger renewable energy installations, said Anish Mandal, partner at Deloitte India.He said current costs have prohibited Indian utilities and developers from scaling up BESS deployment.  103443681What is BESS system?Interconnected rechargeable batteries to store energy and discharge when needed. They can also be used to balance the electric grid by providing backup power.Why is it needed?Energy storage is required when power generation is more than demand during certain hours of the day and lower during others. Renewable energy such as solar power is intermittent in nature. Its generation drops in the evening, while coal-based power can take hours to ramp up and fill the gap which can lead to grid instability. Gas-based and hydropower can be ramped up more quickly during non-solar hours, but their capacities are also limited.In the current situation, when India is seeing increasing power demand along with renewable energy capacity addition, energy storage is critical for meeting demand mismatch and integrating renewable energy with the grid.What are the storage options?There are various energy storage technologies such as pump storage and battery storage. Lithium-ion batteries are currently most cost-effective and of high efficiency. However, battery energy storage is still very expensive and adding capacities needs financial support.",

The fund will be released in five tranches till 2030-31 and help in creation of 4,000 MW hours storage.The Viability Gap Funding, Thakur said, will lead to an investment of Rs 9,500 crore.India aims to meet its 50 per cent of energy requirements through renewable energy and non-fossil energy sourThe scheme is intended to boost battery storage projects critical to India's ambitious plan to expand its renewable energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and cut the cost of battery energy storage from the current 5.5-6.5 rupees per unit.Battery storage, used to back up intermittent renewable power supply to stabilise the grid, is an evolving technology, and there are very few large-scale operational projects in the world. The scheme intends to develop large-scale battery energy storage systems to bring down costs through competitive bidding.The government will provide so-called Viability Gap Funding - incentives to cover risks of developers of critical infrastructure projects that are or may turn out to be economically unviable - in the form of grants for three years, ET had earlier reported, citing sources.It also expects private investments worth 56 billion rupees through the scheme.The disbursement of the contracts will be made in five tranches until 2030-31, one of the sources said, requesting anonymity since the proposal is not yet public and needs federal cabinet approval.Contracts will be awarded through a competitive process, with the company with lowest bid selected, they said. India's power ministry did not respond to a request for comment.A number of Indian conglomerates including Reliance Industries, Adani Power and JSW Energy have plans to set up large-scale battery plants.India has 37 MWh of battery storage capacity currently. According to estimates from its power sector planning body, it requires 236 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery energy storage in addition to 27 GW pump storage projects by 2031-32.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a renewed pitch for diversity in the energy mix, saying there is no one-size-fits-all solution for a world looking to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner sources like solar and hydrogen. India, the world's third-largest energy consumer, has repeatedly stressed on energy transition being just and orderly and nations having a free hand in decisions on the pathway based on the availability of resources.  Our principle is simple - diversity is our best bet, whether in society or in terms of our energy mix,  he told PTI in an exclusive interview here ahead of the G20 summit.  There are no one-size-fits-all solutions. Given the different pathways countries are on, our pathways for energy transition will be different.  Coal, oil and gas make up for almost two-thirds of the world's energy consumption. And replacing them can't happen overnight. Given this, New Delhi is in favour of continuing to invest in today's energy system so as to meet the demands of growing economies and not cause any shortage. And at the same time, investments should flow into transition fuels.  Despite having 17 per cent of the world's population, India's historic share in cumulative emissions has been less than five per cent. Yet, we have left no stone unturned in meeting our climate goals,  Modi said. India ramped up its solar energy capacity 20-fold in just a few years, is now among the top four nations in the world in terms of wind energy, and is playing an important role in both innovation and adoption of electric vehicles, he said.  We are perhaps the first among the G20 countries to have achieved our climate targets nine years ahead of the scheduled date,  he said. India has now pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 45 per cent by 2030. It has set a target of 2070 to achieve net zero and towards that goal committed to generating 50 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, setting up 500 GW of renewable energy capacity and reducing the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes till 2030.  So, we are certainly on track while also tailoring in various factors needed to ensure growth,  Modi said. On the future of the fight against climate change, he said he was extremely positive about it and the country was working with other nations to  alter the approach from a restrictive to a constructive approach .  Rather than focusing purely on the approach of don't do this or that, we want to bring in an attitude that makes people and nations aware of what they can do and help them with that, in terms of finance, technology and other resources,  he added. Last year, the world lost three per cent of gas demand following the Russia-Ukraine war, and the prices went up seven-fold, resulting in countries turning to the next cheaper alternative, coal. India has been long pressing for a just, orderly and sustainable energy transition where the energy needs of its fast-growing economy continue to be met and it is given access to technology and financing for a just and orderly transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, as well as lithium-ion batteries.",

        "articleBody": "We live in extraordinary times. Heatwaves are burning our planet, and record temperature spikes are registered across the globe. No region is unaffected by the climate crisis. This makes the G20 Leaders\u2019 Summit in New Delhi this week even more important. Delegates will arrive in a country hit hard by climate extremes this year. Several parts of India have been reeling under heatwaves and excessive rain. With El Ni\u00f1o building up, the country has witnessed the driest August month since 1901.The global heat wave that has singed large parts of the world again this year proves that it is vital that we see action and delivery from the world\u2019s top economies in the face of a worsening climate emergency. Their task is clear. Every country, regardless of wealth, needs a plan against extreme weather events, lost livelihoods and forced migration. India\u2019s G20 presidency has already succeeded in establishing a Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group. Among other priorities, it aims for global coverage of early warning systems and mobilising finance to combat disasters.However, when it comes to climate finance, promises continue to fall short of delivery. The G20 governments can leverage trillions of dollars in support of the investments required around the world to shift markets towards cleaner energy. Science is unequivocal on the link between lower emissions and protecting communities from devastating heatwaves, storms and drought. It\u2019s thus necessary for the developed nations to make good on their 2009 promise of transferring $100 billion a year to the developing world to mitigate against climate change. The point about historical responsibility is not to allocate blame but to galvanise remedial action.The Reserve Bank of India estimates that Indian industry alone will need more than $1 trillion by 2030 to conform to climate-related norms. But access to the funds will also unlock enormous renewable energy capacity and help build new cleantech industries in the country. This is vital to throttling emissions in the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy and could have ripple effects for the global north by enabling clean, cost-effective manufacturing capacity in a reliable geopolitical and strategic partner.The G20 governments can and must also send signals that the transition from fossil fuels is accelerating. This builds on India\u2019s extraordinary commitment to install 500 gigawatts of renewables by 2030. Clean energy is already 43 per cent of India\u2019s power capacity and its solar energy and electric transport push should result in 1.25 billion tonnes of CO2 abated between 2015 and 2030. This, in turn, can supercharge the COP28 UN climate summit in Dubai later this year, where President Sultan Al-Jaber wants countries to commit to a global energy system \u201cfree of unabated fossil fuels in the middle of this century.\u201d He cannot deliver this without the G20.In the past, many G20 leaders thought of climate disasters as episodes that must be managed \u2014 temporary, localised glitches that require one-off interventions \u2014 and won\u2019t dent their political capital. But these disasters are now chronic and affecting entire stretches across borders. This demands a different response: the willingness to act fast and take hold of the roots of this crisis. Despite the deluge of bad news, the good news is that there are proven and cost-effective blueprints necessary for an energy transition. Recent analysis indicates wind and solar energy is set to supply over a third of all power by 2030 globally.Common sense dictates the G20 use these tailwinds to its advantage, unleashing financial support to lower the cost of capital for clean technology, install new solar and wind capacity, and improve energy efficiency across emerging and developing markets. The clean energy transition is a trillion-dollar investment opportunity. Finance, smartly deployed, can de-risk as well as scale up private investment. This is a win-win strategy that will be a tangible use of climate finance, generate healthy returns on investment, deliver clean, scalable and more accessible energy to all and negate the worst of the climate crisis.This is not to say the politics of the transition are easy. Current global temperatures are a metaphor for the geopolitical fires that burn globally, from Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine to the tensions between China and the US. The energy crisis has led to some nations backtracking on their commitments in the face of volatile gas prices, while T\u00fcrkiye and Indonesia have increased their reliance on coal for electricity generation since 2015. Meanwhile, the EU and US are investing in new gas production and storage. Yet, much of the climate crisis stems from a decades-long reliance on carbon-heavy energy. This G20 meeting calls for far-sighted and brave leadership: acting on climate now is the only true answer to the snowballing impacts of climate change, and the strategies proposed must be endorsed \u2014 and acted upon \u2014 by the IMF and the World Bank.An ambitious joint statement from the leaders\u2019 meeting will set the ground for COP28. It will help pick up the pace on the energy transition and accelerate work to adapt to a hotter world. It\u2019s equally important to recognise the consequences of failure and how it could undermine global climate ambition.India\u2019s flood waters have receded for now. But global political ambition cannot be allowed to, because every delay will be counted in lives and livelihoods lost. G20\u2019s heads of states now have an opportunity to show they are taking control, and they should seize it with the intention and seriousness the situation calls for.Arunabha Ghosh is CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and Rachel Kyte is Dean Emerita at the Fletcher School, Tufts University.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: India's proposal for a global alliance on biofuels among members of the Group of 20 major economies will help accelerate sustainable biofuels deployment in support of the global energy transition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said. The biofuels alliance, which the world's third biggest oil consumer wants to push during its G20 presidency, mirrors the International Solar Alliance (ISA) piloted by New Delhi and Paris in 2015 to bring clean and affordable solar energy within the reach of all.  Such (biofuel) alliances are aimed at creating options for developing countries to advance their energy transitions,  the prime minister told PTI in an exclusive interview late last week.  Biofuels are also important from the perspective of a circular economy. Markets, trade, technology, and policy - all aspects of international cooperation are crucial in creating such opportunities,  he said. Biofuel is a renewable source of energy which is derived from biomass. India, which imports over 85 per cent of its crude oil needs, is gradually building capacity to produce fuel from items including crop stubble, plant waste, and municipal solid waste.  Such alternatives can enhance energy security, create opportunities for domestic industry, and create green jobs - all crucial elements in ensuring a transition that leaves no one behind,  Modi said. While India is on schedule to double the mixing of ethanol extracted from sugarcane and agriculture waste to 20 per cent with petrol by 2025, dozens of compressed biogas (CBG) plants are being set up. The alliance is aimed at facilitating cooperation and intensifying the use of sustainable biofuels, including in the transportation sector. Its focus primarily is on strengthening markets, facilitating global biofuels trade, development of concrete policy lesson-sharing, and provision of technical support for national biofuels programs worldwide. Such an initiative is also aimed at helping India's transition to alternative fuels and cutting its import bill, as it aims to achieve its net zero carbon emissions goal by 2070. The prime minister said that in an interconnected and interdependent world, the greater the capacities and capabilities of the countries around the world, the greater the global resilience.  When the links in a chain are weak, each crisis further weakens the complete chain. But when the links are strong, the global chain can handle any crisis, utilising each other's strengths,  he said making a case for global alliance. Stating that the protection and preservation of the planet for future generations was a shared responsibility that needs to be given top priority, he noted that great progress has been made in climate-centric initiatives within India.  India ramped up its solar energy capacity 20-fold in just a few years. It is among the top four nations in the world in terms of wind energy. In the electric vehicle revolution, India is playing an important role in both innovation and adoption,  he said.  We are perhaps the first among the G-20 countries to have achieved our climate targets nine years ahead of the scheduled date.  Also, the action against single-use plastic has been recognised across the world. Great strides have also been made in safe sanitation and cleanliness.  Naturally, we have moved from being just a member of global efforts to playing a leading role in many initiatives. Initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure are bringing countries together for the planet. The ISA has got a great response with over 100 countries joining it,  he said. The Mission LiFE initiative focuses on lifestyle for the environment.  Each lifestyle decision can be made based on what impact it will have on the planet in the long term,  he added. The ISA aims to mobilise more than USD 1000 billion of investment needed by 2030 for the massive deployment of solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global sustainable biofuel production would need to triple by 2030 to put the world's energy system on track towards net zero emissions by 2050. Liquid biofuels provided more than four per cent of the total transport energy supply in 2022.",

        "articleBody": "Lucknow: To encourage clean and green energy production sources in Uttar Pradesh in view of global warming and climate change, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday directed officials to prepare an effective draft for the UP Green Hydrogen Policy-2023. Adityanath gave these directions at a meeting with the officials of UP NEDA (UP New and Renewable Energy Development Agency) here at his official residence. The chief minister instructed the officials to prepare an effective draft by consulting the stakeholders working in this area so that investors and users can get maximum benefit from the policy, an official statement issued here said. During the meeting, the chief minister said that green hydrogen, being a clean energy and industrial fuel, would prove helpful in achieving the goal of net zero. In this case, the department should draft an effective policy after carefully examining the Government of India's green hydrogen policy, he said.  Water plays an important role in the production of green hydrogen. In Uttar Pradesh, there are many rivers. We can take advantage of this and become the largest green hydrogen producer in the country,  he said. He directed the department to coordinate with the Irrigation Department, create water reserves near small and big rivers in the state, and use rainwater to produce green hydrogen. Instructions were given to support firms producing green hydrogen energy by offering them the greatest incentives. The chief minister said that during the Global Investors Summit (GIS) 2023, the state received investment proposals worth Rs 2.73 lakh crore from 20 companies to set up units in the green hydrogen sector.  This will create job opportunities for more than 60,000 people. The state government is committed to honestly implementing all the MOUs signed in GIS-2023. In such a situation, to fix our accountability, we have to implement the Green Hydrogen Policy as soon as possible,  he said. In light of this, encouraging green hydrogen/ammonia production, market development, and demand aggregation should be prioritized in the draft of the UP Green Hydrogen Policy 2023, he said.",

At a press conference here, Union Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the central government is going to procure air-conditioned buses for this soon. Secretary, Housing and Urban Affairs, Manoj Joshi said the scheme will be rolled out in 169 cities and states are required to submit their proposals by September 30. He said the guidelines were issued two days back. Travelling on these electric buses will be a metro-like experience, the official said. According to Joshi, tickets will be available through an automatic fare system. Operators running these buses will be paid Rs 20-40 per kilometre under the scheme. Puri said the scheme involves Centre, state governments and service providers. He exuded confidence that the e-bus scheme will do very well. The Union Cabinet approved the scheme earlier this month to enhance green mobility. The scheme will have an estimated cost of Rs 57,613 crore, of which Rs 20,000 crore will be provided by the central government and the remaining will be borne by the states. The government said that priority will be given to those cities which do not have an organised bus service. The scheme would continue till 2037. The scheme has two segments -- augmenting city bus services in 169 cities and green urban mobility initiatives in 181 cities. The e-buses will be made available in cities with a population between three lakh and 40 lakh. The scheme will support bus operations for 10 years.  The cities will be selected through a challenge (for the scheme). Non-motorised transport would also be provided to help public transport in these cities,  Union minister Anurag Thakur had said earlier this month.  Of the total Rs 20,000 crore to be given by the government of India, Rs 15,930 crore will be for buses, Rs 2,264 crore for infrastructure development and back-end facilities, besides Rs 1,506 crore for green urban mobility,  he said. The Union housing and urban affairs ministry said that under the scheme, cities will be responsible for running the bus services and making payments to bus operators.",

        "articleBody": "The total capital outlay for roads and renewables in 2023-24 and 2024-25 is likely to jump by 35 per cent to Rs 13 lakh crore compared to that in the last two fiscal years, according to a report. Conducive policies, rising investor interest and strong execution speed are expected to drive the capital outlay in the sectors, the report by Crisil Ratings said on Tuesday.  The pace of road construction and capacity addition in renewables is seen growing by 25 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively, in the current and next fiscal, and the capex growth is expected to sustain over the medium term, the report said.  Crisil Ratings Managing Director Gurpreet Chhatwal said the pace of execution of renewable energy projects is set to increase 33 per cent to 20 GW per annum over the current and next fiscal as compared to 15 GW per annum in the past two fiscal years, supported by a healthy executable pipeline of 50 GW of projects as of March 2023.  Similarly, road construction is set to improve 25 per cent to 12,500-13,000 km annually over the current and next fiscal, driven by healthy awarding of projects and step-up in execution, it said.  Chhatwal said the levels at which companies are bidding for projects is a key monitorable going forward.  The agency's Senior Director Manish Gupta said while the last two years have seen aggressive bidding, there are no challenges on the implementation side.  Gupta said investor interest has been encouraging, with Rs 75,000-80,000 crore raised through equity and asset monetisation in the past two fiscals in both these sectors.  Continued focus on asset monetisation and equity raising, along with healthy cash flows, will keep the capital structure balanced in both sectors, the report said.  According to the report, despite higher capital outlays, rated renewables and road entities should have a healthy average debt service cushion of 1.2x-1.3x over the tenure of debt on their balance sheets, which supports their credit profiles.  About the upcoming general elections, Gupta said the government is aware of it and is trying to finish as many projects as possible before the polls.  Replying to a question on the recent slowdown in the pace of road construction, Chhatwal said every year, the pace of work is higher in the second half of the fiscal and the agency expects the same to continue this fiscal as well.  The pace of road construction will increase to 34 km per day by the end of 2024-25, a 25 per cent jump over the current pace, its Chief Rating Officer Krishnan Sitaraman said.  Timely asset monetisation will remain important in the roads sector as InvITs continue to grow, the report said, adding that for renewables, if geopolitical developments affect supply chains, it may impact the internal rate of return and pose a risk to estimates.",

The PLI scheme for ACC has been floated to make India self-reliant in the transition to clean energy, when the country is projected to see sales of a million electric cars and 22 million electric two-wheelers by 2030.Senior government officials ET spoke with said industry stakeholders have recommended that the government reduce the minimum capacity required to become eligible for PLI ACC and make it flexible at 1 GWh (gigawatt hours) or 3 GWh from the minimum of 5 GWh in the earlier round, to allow more companies to participate and foster innovation. We have held consultations with stakeholders. They have asked for more flexibility in minimum capacity. We are looking into it.

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The government is looking at including electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure within the priority sector lending category, a senior official said Saturday, a move that would come as a boost for the sector. We have received a representation to include EV infra in the priority sector. We will look at reworking the priority sector lending (PSL) requirements for banks,  the official said, adding that the issue will be discussed with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The power ministry has also written a letter to the Department of Financial Services in this regard, the official said. According to RBI guidelines, it is mandatory for banks to extend 40% of their adjusted net bank credit to the priority sector.PSL currently includes seven sectors - agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises, export credit, education, housing, social infrastructure and renewable energy.The government wants to increase the proportion of EVs on Indian roads as part of efforts to meet its net zero target. It offers subsidies to manufacturers under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) programme.Inclusion of EV infrastructure under PSL is expected to boost credit flow to the sector by providing a mandate for financial institutions. According to a January 2022 Niti Aayog report, electric two- and three-wheelers, as well as four-wheelers for commercial use, represent favourable segments for inclusion in priority sector lending.103097172 EV sales crossed 700,000 in the first half of 2023. An earlier ET report had indicated that banks were pitching to include loans for electric vehicle infra and green hydrogen as part of priority sector lending.  Cumulative investment in India's electric vehicle transition could be as large as Rs 19.7 lakh crore ($266 billion) between 2020 and 2030, highlighting the need for higher liquidity and lower cost of capital for EV assets and infrastructure,  the report had noted. People in the know informed ET that non-life insurance companies were unlikely to see any capital infusion this year.  Their situation is not so bad that they cannot self-sustain,  one of the persons cited said. The government had not budgeted any provision for capital infusion for this year, but ET earlier reported it was considering an infusion of Rs 3,000 crore.Micro-insuranceThe government is also looking to expand the coverage of micro-insurance products. It has asked banks to extend coverage of accident and life insurance schemes to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) bank account holders. We aim to cover most of the people with our micro-insurance scheme and are coordinating with other ministries to increase coverage,  financial services secretary Vivek Joshi said on Saturday, pointing out that anganwadi workers could be deployed to promote such programmes.The ministry also indicated that the E-Shram portal could be tapped in coordination with the labour ministry to increase the coverage of schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana.The government announced earlier this month that the number of PMJDY accounts had touched 500 million. Over the last nine years, the average balance in these accounts has increased 3.8 times - from just over Rs 1,000 to nearly Rs 4,000.",

Climate change is not just a headline but a reality and while the world sees this reality unfolding, paradoxically the dependence on fossil fuel is on the rise, Jindal said.   We are in a race against time navigating geopolitical challenges and energy crisis and striving to uphold our commitments under the Paris Agreement,  the JSW Group Chairman said at the B20 Summit India 2023 in the national capital.  What the B20 task force is pushing for can be summarised in four broad steps.  First is global cooperation for net zero transition. The mission to embrace clean energy is universal. This is our call for global alliance urging nations and industries to collaborate to innovate and make the next generation of clean energy a tangible reality.   And it's not just about the clean energy, it's about a clean future for the supply chain too, he said.  Secondly, ramping up climate finance. Capital is the life blood of transformation, he said, adding that there is a need for more channalised finance towards green initiatives and more affordable with better financing options that benefit everyone.   Thirdly, a just and equitable transition toward clean energy is for all. Our move to a green future must be inclusive and resilient that doesn't leave anyone behind from guaranteeing energy security...,  he said.  His fourth and last recommendation was for promoting circular economy as he said it's not just about using resources but doing so wisely, efficiently and in a sustainable manner.   We need solid frameworks that prioritise the mainstream resource efficiency collaboration is the tallest rule of our mission by pooling our expertise, knowledge and passions ....with unity, collaboration and shared knowledge we can spark the change that not just benefit to a community of country or continent but the entire world.   This B20 Summit in India isn't just a gathering of influential minds, it's a melting point of ideas and missions and collective will to drive transformation.   It's crucial that we harness this opportunity to amplify our collective voice to catalyse change on a global scale. Our quest is a sweeping transition to clean energy This isn't merely an energy shift, it's a social and societal revolution so what's our mission, a shift to clean energy that's so profound it will touch every aspect of our life, our economy, supply chains, daily business, even how we power our home,  he added.",

India has 186 GW non-fossil fuel-based installed power generation capacity at present, the Union Minister of Power, New and Renewable Energy said.   In 2015, we planned to have 40 per cent renewables in our energy mix by 2030. We achieved the target in 2021, nine years earlier,  he said, adding that the share of renewable energy in the total installed power generation capacity will be 65 per cent by 2030.  Speaking at an event for the release of a book authored by ReNew Power Chairman Sumant Sinha, the minister said the speed of capacity addition of renewable energy is mind boggling.   We have planned 50 GW renewable energy capacity addition every year,  he said said.  Currently, India has 423 GW of installed power generation capacity.  The country will need 40 GW more electricity this year as the country's power demand grew at 14 per cent, Singh said.  About Sinha's book 'Fossil Free - Reimagining Clean Energy in Carbon Constrained World', the minister said it is relevant as it tells what all has happened in the sector and what needs to done today to boost renewables.  Sinha, ReNew Founder, CEO and Chairman, said India Inc's annual capex is about USD 100 billion and  half of it needs to go to renewables if we have to reach 500 GW by 2030 .  India has set a target of having 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.  Sinha highlighted the importance of round-the-clock power in the context of renewable energy.  The first edition of the book was launched in 2020.",

        "articleBody": "Earlier this year, Indian-origin scientist Joyeeta Gupta, professor of environment and development in the Global South at the University of Amsterdam, won the Spinoza Prize, the highest award in Dutch academia, sometimes referred to as the Dutch Nobel prize. Gupta\u2019s work lies at the intersection of climate crisis, governance and justice, and the jury recognised it as \u201cextremely broad and interdisciplinary\u201d: She was also the lead author of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 along with former US vice-president Al Gore. Currently in Delhi, she spoke to Indulekha Aravind about the inadequacies of the global response to the climate crisis, why net zero could be a fig leaf and why she feels growth should not be measured in terms of GDP alone. Edited excerpts:We are living in a world where climate extremities are increasing, from fires in Canada and Greece to flooding in Delhi. Is the global response to this adequate?For the last 33 years \u2014 since 1990, when the negotiations began on climate change \u2014my feeling has been that all the countries are waiting for others to take action and as a consequence, there\u2019s been a continuous delay in action. In the beginning, the developing countries were really keen that the developed countries take action. At that time, the US claimed it was not easy for them to do so if developing countries in the long term did not take action. As a consequence, there is a situation where no one is willing to break that trend and take leadership. The EU was doing a relatively good job till the war on Ukraine broke out. Nowadays, countries are claiming they will work towards net zero, that they will compensate their emissions by ensuring these are absorbed by trees or through carbon capture and storage, which involves putting greenhouse gas emissions underground. But this net zero story can be a fig leaf.What about the approach of the Global South?In the Global South, in theory, if you are not as dependent on fossil fuels as the Global North, it\u2019s easier to invest in renewables. But what has happened in many of the developing countries is, they are following in the footsteps of the north. The other challenge, of course, is the design of cities. We know that in the Global South, they are going to be constructing a large number of new cities. These cities need to be compact because if you make the cities sprawling, you\u2019ll need massive amounts of public transport and will have to convert forest land into urban land.You mentioned that net zero can be a fig leaf. But we have countries, including India, and companies announcing net zero targets. How should that be viewed?I understand that it\u2019s impossible for every individual, every company, every government to get to zero. But when you say you will achieve net zero, there must be a clear-cut plan on how you are getting there. It should not be an excuse for not getting off fossil fuels. Suppose I\u2019m reasonably well off and say that every time I\u2019m using fossil fuel, I\u2019ll plant a tree somewhere in the world. But if people in different parts of the world say this, where is the land and where is the water to plant all these trees? What may also happen is, you may get a lot of plantations coming up, which is not what we want. Even putting CO2 underground has been on the agenda for 40 years. It didn\u2019t take off because it\u2019s expensive. Now it is often used by fossil fuel companies as an excuse for business as usual. You need to have a really strong accounting mechanism.India has been increasing its investments in renewables. What more should it be doing (to reduce dependence on fossil fuels)?In 1972, when I was in school in India, we were taken to these science exhibitions on renewable energy. India was the first country in the world to have a non-conventional energy ministry. So we actually had a head start over other countries. But it slowed down. Now, we are doing a lot but it\u2019s going to be a little complicated. We should look at reducing pollution from transport by promoting public transport that will be so good that people will use it. We should look at how we can make public transport more electric. The solution is not a lot of private electric cars because then you have the problem of too many batteries, etc. Along with the supply side, you have to address the demand side. Since the time I was in Delhi when I was younger, the city has gotten hotter and wealthier. So you end up having more air conditioners. How do you construct buildings in a way that these are cooler? It\u2019s not about any single thing but about how you get the balance back to cities. You have spoken about how you are opposed to measuring growth in terms of an increase in the gross domestic product (GDP). Why is that so? Let\u2019s take the example of drinking water \u2014 if a community does not provide clean water, everyone will buy a water purifier, which is the case in Delhi where I am now. This will look like it\u2019s actually increasing the GDP since there\u2019s a whole industry around water purifiers. But you just needed a municipality that gave you clean water. So your GDP is looking at how you are substituting for nature. But you are actually using many more resources, more energy and polluting much more as a consequence of the waste that comes out. Or, take sickness. Suppose you have people falling sick due to polluted water or air. If they go to a hospital and pay bills, that too will look like the GDP is going up. But, in fact, you are getting sick people. GDP does not value the health of people. That\u2019s the social and environmental cost of inaction. How do we organise our societies in such a way that the GDP also captures the damage to nature and the value of being healthy?Your recent research, published in Nature, was on the importance of earth system boundaries in mitigating climate change. Could you explain?In 2009, a paper was published in Nature on \u201cPlanetary Boundaries\u201d. It said if you lose a certain degree of integrity in the systems that support life on earth, life would become impossible. For example, if the way we produce food means the bees or other pollinators die, then you\u2019ll have a problem with your food system. The idea was, we would try to create boundaries to how we can use nature as well as things like plastics. In earth system boundaries, we go further \u2014 we quantify boundaries not just at the global level because a global number makes no sense to the man on the street. We identify boundaries from local to global level, and we are not only looking at what is safe, we also look at what is just. In water, for instance, we looked at how much water you need in your rivers to keep that system functioning and how much water can you take from groundwater systems to keep that functioning. With surface water, we said that it should not vary more than 20% in relation to a baseline year around 1850. These boundaries can be used to generate ambient and emission standards. If you create these standards, you might be able to move towards a legal system where rules require producers and consumers to minimise their use of resources and their wastes and you end up protecting nature.In the Global South, what gives you hope and what fills you with dread?I\u2019m seeing a lot of social movements emerge in certain parts of the world in the Global South. These social movements are really pushing the agenda about respecting nature and reducing energy use and moving away from fossil fuels. Court cases, too, give me hope. On the opposite side, and this is not just in the Global South but worldwide \u2014 you are seeing a shrinking of civic space. Protests are being radically suppressed. In the south, activists are also being killed. I\u2019m seeing a lot of reprisals. That fills me with dread.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Coal PSUs have planned to scale up their total installed renewable energy capacity to 7,231 megawatt (MW) by 2027, an official statement said on Thursday. About 1,600 MW of renewable capacity has already been created till March 2023, by the PSUs Coal India Ltd (CIL), NLC India Ltd (NLCIL), and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL). On Tuesday, Union Coal and Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi said coal PSUs have made an investment plan of Rs 2.5 lakh crore for developing renewable energy (projects), installing clean coal technologies and new mine development projects. In a statement, the Coal Ministry said,  CPSEs will achieve 7,231 MW RE capacity by 2027. CIL and its subsidiaries and NLCIL have planned to install 3000 MW and 3,731 MW of renewable energy capacity, respectively. In line with the Panchamrit commitment of the Prime Minister, CPSEs are advised to diligently draft net zero plan for the coal mining sector.  As per the national commitment, Coal PSUs have meticulously prepared a three years action plan outlining specific renewable targets. SCCL, which is jointly owned by the Government of Telangana and Government of India on a 51:49 equity basis, has also planned to install 550 MW by the targeted year. RE projects totalling 1,769 MW have been awarded for this financial year i.e. 2023-24. Out of this, CIL has awarded 399 MW and NLCIL has awarded 1370 MW. An additional 2,553 MW capacity, 1110 MW by NLCIL and 1443 MW CIL is scheduled to be awarded by the PSUs in 2024-25. Besides, CIL and NLCIL are planning to establish large solar parks in Gujarat and Rajasthan. NLCIL has already awarded 300 MW solar power plant work to Tata Power which is expected to be completed within 18 months. Furthermore, NLCIL has also awarded a tender of 300 MW for a solar park and another 300 MW solar park likely under green shoe option to be set up in Gujarat. ABI MR",

        "articleBody": "Bengaluru: The success of India's evolving carbon market will depend critically on the choice of design features and the regulator\u2019s ability to enforce them, Rohini Pande, Director of Economic Growth Centre at Yale University told ET. The Henry Heinz II Economics Professor and winner of Infosys Prize 2022 in Social Sciences said the market could be a more effective means to curb carbon emissions than a tax on emissions, drawing on the learnings from her work with Surat's particulate matter pollution market.In Surat\u2019s market, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board was the regulatory authority. \u201cThere is a system where, before the market is launched, participating firms post a hefty bond. If a firm does not hold sufficient permits for its emissions at the end of a compliance period, then the firm is penalised directly from the bond.\u201d she said. A similar policy could be promising in the context of the upcoming carbon market.While the government issued a notification about the carbon market scheme in May this year, the details of implementation are yet to be determined. These features include how the permits will be given to participating companies and whether there will be a cap on aggregate carbon emissions in the market. Earlier this week, Pande presented a lecture at the Infosys Science Foundation in Bengaluru on the past, present and future of India\u2019s emissions market. Under a cap and trade market system, like the one used in Surat\u2019s particulate matter pollution market, Pande explained, the governing body establishes a total \u201ccap\u201d (limit) of the emissions it is going to allow. In Surat, this cap was in terms of particulate matter. In a carbon market this is typically in terms of aggregate carbon emissions. Companies would be given, or sold, a certain number of permits, corresponding to the amount of carbon they are allowed to emit. They can sell the permits they don\u2019t need in the market. This means that companies that can reduce carbon emissions cheaply can sell permits to those which would find it more expensive to reduce emissions, or which need to emit more - thus incentivising the most cost-efficient adaptation of clean technologies.Under this system, the government would either reduce the cap over time, to reduce overall emissions, or increase the cap slowly to ensure that emissions from economic growth do not exceed negotiated commitments. Government companies can also be part of the system, Pande added.Safeguards, she said, are necessary, especially about speculators entering the market, which could turn it either way. Pande was optimistic however about India benefiting from international climate financing bodies entering the market. \u201cWell-run markets have a higher credibility than the Clean Development Mechanisms (CDMs) under the Kyoto protocol,\u201d she said.Under the protocol, Annex B countries, or countries with emission reduction commitments could earn carbon credits by building emission-reduction projects in developing countries. One of the criticisms of the scheme was that international companies could be rewarded for projects that did not end up reducing emissions to the extent expected. The Indian government plans to introduce a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) by 2026 to enable the country to reach its goal of reducing emissions intensity of GDP to 45% of 2005 levels by 2030. The target is part of India\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. Last month, the government announced that it would appoint a National Steering Committee to oversee the market, which will function under both the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.",

The Aayog is of the view that a thriving domestic lithium-ion battery (LIB) manufacturing industry will need resilient supply chains of critical minerals and raw materials, such as lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) and spherical graphite to manufacture key lithium ion battery components and boost domestic value addition.According to the Aayog, India\u2019s advanced chemistry cell manufacturing industry will need 193 thousand tons per annum of cathode active material to produce 100 GWh per annum of batteries by 2030.Critical minerals and their active materials used in the production of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) account for approximately 33 per cent-48 per cent of the overall LIB pack cost depending on cathode chemistry and supply chain costs for mining and refining of critical minerals.\u201cThe synthesis of Lithium-Nickel, Manganese, Cobalt (Li-NMC) and lithium ion phosphate (LFP) battery active materials from critical mineral precursors alone can contribute 12% domestic value addition in lithium-ion battery (LIB) pack manufacturing,\u201d it said.The Aayog has further proposed strengthening Indian missions in critical mineral bearing foreign countries to facilitate due diligence of greenfield or brownfield mining assets, acquisition and investment by Indian companies.\u201cG20 Critical Minerals Security Partnership\u201d (G20-CMSP) should focus on building a resilient supply chain of critical battery minerals, including stockpiles in different member countries as per comparative advantages in extraction and processing,\u201d it said.\u201cKey stakeholders should prioritize critical battery minerals supply chain as a key pillar of Indo-Pacific economic framework and a key factor in diplomatic outreach with mineral bearing foreign countries R&D to develop recycling, extraction technologies and find earth abundant alternatives to critical battery minerals,\u201d it added.",

COP 28 or Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Climate Change Conference is scheduled to be held in Expo City, Dubai, from November 30 to December 12, this year. As a group, the G20 represents 85 per cent of the world's GDP and 80 per cent of the world's emissions.  What you decide will have a huge influence on outcomes for everyone, everywhere,  Al Jaber said while speaking at the fourth G20 Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group and Ministerial Meeting here.  There is still time for the G20 to show leadership, and I am calling on all of you to work with your leaders to drive global climate action in this critical decade,  he said. He even referred to his joint statement on July 27 calling upon the G20 to show leadership in closing the gaps across all of the pillars of the Paris Agreement and help the world get on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. He said many indicators were going in the wrong direction.  Temperature records continue to be broken, with this month officially recorded as the hottest in history. We are losing biodiversity. Agricultural land is being degraded. And food insecurity is increasing,  Jaber said. Transformation of food systems is also a top priority for the COP28 Presidency  and we need it to be your priority as well,  he said. COP 28 will be the first edition of the conference to explicitly link climate impacts to global health, with a day dedicated to health issues, and the first-ever climate health ministerial meeting in partnership with the World Health Organisation. The President-Designate invited all G20 nations to partner on this to ensure the resilience of global health systems. During his visit, Al Jaber held strategic bilateral meetings with key environmental and climate ministers to build consensus on the road to COP 28. He also met Japan's Minister for Environment Akihiro Nishimura, Brazil's Minister for Environment and Climate Change Marina Silva, United States' Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, Germany's Special Representative for International Climate Policy Jennifer Morgan and India's Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav. Sultan's visit to Chennai and the G20 closely follows his meetings in Bangladesh last week, where he met Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and other global leaders to share his core action agenda.",

        "articleBody": "The G20 Energy Ministerial in Goa fell short of providing a sufficiently clear signal for scaling up renewables and phasing down fossil fuels, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell and COP28 President-Designate Sultan Al Jaber said in a joint statement on Thursday. The bloc, responsible for 85 per cent of the world's GDP and 80 per cent of the emissions, on Saturday failed to reach a consensus on tripling renewable energy deployment to 11 gigawatts by 2030, phasing down the unabated use of fossil fuels and plans to finance the transition during the Energy Ministerial Meeting held last week.  This year, more than ever, unity is a prerequisite for success. Globally, the world has experienced its hottest summer on record, climate change continues to impact people every day, particularly the climate vulnerable, and they are looking to us to take decisive action,  the joint statement quoted Stiell and Al Jaber as saying. They emphasised the need for a strong mitigation outcome at the COP28 in Dubai, UAE, later this year to drive a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and build on the progress of previous conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). They also called on the G20 to  lead the way on the basis of both science and equity  for a strong and credible outcome that supports developing countries in undertaking a just transition. The world must take necessary steps to accelerate the  inevitable decarbonisation  in a responsible manner while enabling energy access for all, promoting sustainable development and supporting just transition, according to the joint statement.  Tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvements across sectors by 2030, including ramping up electrification and enhanced cooling approaches, is critical to enable this,  they said.",

        "articleBody": "India could play a pivotal role in energy transition and be a leader in green hydrogen because of the lower cost of renewable energy generation, International Energy Agency (IEA) executive director Fatih Birol told ET\u2019s Shilpa Samant in an interview. The country can increase foreign investment flow into green energy significantly if it simplifies bureaucratic procedures, he said. Edited excerpts:What is the kind of role that India could play in the various emerging technologies for energy transition?India can make three types of contributions to global energy transition. It needs to make its voice much stronger to highlight successful interventions in the last few years \u2013 like full electrification of villages, the Ujjwala programme (to provide LPG connection to poor households), the LED revolution, and now the solar push. It can be a source of inspiration for many countries. The second is, it could share its expertise in reaching these goals. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi met US President Joe Biden recently in Washington, there was a paragraph in the joint statement on the support to India for full membership of IEA. I am looking forward to India becoming a member of IEA soon. The third one is, there are many challenges to reaching our energy and climate goals. But the most important challenge is forging international collaborations in a fair and effective way. There are not many countries in terms of size, convening power, and economy that can build a bridge amongst all. I think that India can be a pivotal player in the clean energy transition.How do you see India\u2019s energy demand going forward?India\u2019s energy demand will be very strong because its economy is growing, and it is getting industrialised. For me, the biggest challenge for India is, how we find investments in green energy? In my view, India is perhaps the number one country in terms of foreign investments for three reasons \u2013 you have the rule of law, there is political and economic stability, and there is huge potential for energy demand growth. If India is able to simplify the bureaucratic procedures of investment flows, we will see foreign investment flowing in India significantly.The G20 Energy Transition Working Group has agreed on low-cost financing to facilitate energy transition. What concrete measures do you think are needed on that?The agreement is good, but we must materialise it. I believe that international financial institutions, regional financial institutions, and development banks should take reducing the cost of capital for clean energy in developing countries as a priority and provide some concessional funding to them. They shouldn't behave like a commercial bank and should put this as a priority.The Russia-Ukraine war has brought energy security to the fore. Do you see it as a headwind for energy transition?Many people understand that the more energy you produce at home, especially clean, the better it is for security. For example, if you are generating solar and wind, you are going towards clean energy. On the other hand, you are going to import less. The driving force behind clean energy is not only sustainability and climate change but also energy security. It is the reason clean energy is moving fast, and faster than many people think.You have advocated for developed nations to support the developing ones in the energy transition. Do we see any tangible advancement towards it?Clean energy investment around the world is growing very fast, but in the developing world, it has been flat in the last five-six years. Around $1.7 trillion investment has been made in clean energy as of today from $1 trillion in 2015. But almost all the growth came from the advanced economies and China. To address climate change, we need this everywhere. Emissions don\u2019t have a passport. Not only ethically, but rationally too, it is important that we provide clean energy investments or facilitate those to the developing countries.Green or low-carbon hydrogen is potentially seen as the fuel of the future, where India aims to be a leading producer. Do you see it progressing on that?India is a top runner for green hydrogen because the cost of generating renewable energy is one of the lowest in the world. But what India needs to do, in my view, is to look at the manufacturing side of clean energy technologies \u2013 it can be solar panels or electrolysers for hydrogen. Because it is important not to rely on one country to have a dominant position in clean energy technologies for diversification. India should have its own manufacturing and, therefore, production-linked incentives schemes should be endorsed. India should produce its own electrolysers, and also more solar panels\u2026and hopefully soon batteries as well.",

        "articleBody": "The government so far is not looking to frame a separate policy for providing incentives to US-based electric car maker Tesla, and the company can apply to avail support measures under existing schemes like PLI for auto and advanced chemistry cells, a government official has said.The government has already rolled out the production-linked incentives schemes (PLI) for advanced chemistry cell (ACC) battery storage with an outlay of Rs 18,100 crore and Rs 26,058 crore PLI scheme for auto, auto-components and drone industries. We have told Tesla that the policies, which are already there for all, they can also apply under that PLI. They are welcome. Generally, the policy will be the same for all. For a single company, the government may not like to make separate policies. So far, there is no plan to give special treatment,  the official said.Representatives of Tesla's biggest supplier of batteries Panasonic have met  us and they have stated that they want to make batteries. We have suggested them to apply under PLI ACC batteries , the official added.The government last week announced the re-bidding of production-linked incentives for 20 GWh advanced chemistry cell manufacturing. The Ministry of Heavy Industries is holding a stakeholder consultation with industry representatives on July 24 for their inputs and suggestions before the start of the re-bidding process of the remaining 20 GWh capacity.The representatives of Tesla visited the country last month to meet officials of various ministries, including the Commerce and Industry Ministry.In 2021, the US-based electric car maker demanded a reduction in import duties on electric vehicles (EVs) in India.At present, cars imported as completely built units (CBUs) attract customs duty ranging from 60 per cent to 100 per cent, depending on engine size and cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value less or above USD 40,000.The world's largest electric car producer Tesla Inc's chief Elon Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month in New York.Musk, after meeting the Prime Minister, said he plans to visit India in 2024. I am confident that Tesla will be in India, and we will do so as soon as humanly possible,  Musk had said after that meeting. We don't want to jump the gun on an announcement, but I think it's quite likely that it will be a significant investment, a relationship with India,  Musk had said.India, the world's third-largest energy consumer, is pitching as an alternate destination for investment for US companies to capitalise on the growing chill between Beijing and Washington.",

The outcome document on the Energy Transitions Ministers' meeting has stressed expediting the voluntary transfer on mutually agreed terms or co-development and adoption of clean, sustainable and low carbon emission energy technologies, which are often capital-intensive and necessitate low-cost financing from various sources. The meeting, chaired by Union Power Minister R K Singh, noted the report on  Low-cost Financing for the Energy Transition  prepared under the Indian Presidency and its estimation that the world needs an annual investment of over USD 4 trillion, with a high share of renewable energy in the primary energy mix.  We reiterate that access to low-cost financing, particularly for developing countries, is pivotal for accelerating the efforts towards energy transitions while ensuring energy access, energy security, affordability and market stability,  the document reads. The members resolved to ensure accelerated energy transitions. The document mentions that the delegates recognize the need for international finance institutions and multilateral development banks to enhance and develop new mechanisms and products to promote access to low-cost financing in line with their mandates and governance framework as well as to scale up the mobilization of private finance for this purpose.  We recognize the importance of increasing finance from a variety of sources including public and private, bilateral and multilateral arrangements,  the document said.It was resolved during the meeting to share best practices, and risk mitigation strategies, and foster international cooperation for low-cost financing solutions.  In this context, we note the 'Voluntary Action Plan for Lowering the cost of Finance for Energy Transitions' prepared by the Indian Presidency,  the document stated.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said India has shown leadership in climate action, achieved non-fossil installed electric capacity target nine years in advance, and plans to achieve 50% non-fossil installed capacity by 2030.Addressing the G20 Energy Ministers' Meeting in Goa virtually, Modi called for low-cost finance for developing countries, ways to bridge technology gaps, and measures to promote energy security and diversify supply chains. India is the most populated nation and the fastest-growing large economy in the world,  the prime minister said.  Yet, we are moving strongly on our climate commitments.  India is making great efforts in green growth and energy transition and the country is among the global leaders in solar and wind power, he said. The country has connected more than 190 million families with LPG in the last nine years and every village has electricity. We are also working to provide piped cooking gas to people. It has the potential to cover more than 90% of the population in a few years,  Modi said, adding that the government's effort is to work for inclusive, resilient, equitable, and sustainable energy for all. He said small steps have led to big results, pointing to the success of LED lights, now the largest LED distribution programme in the world that has saved more than 45 billion units of energy per year.The PM shared India's sustainable energy programmes. He said India has the largest agricultural pump solarisation initiative in the world, the domestic electric vehicle market is projected to reach 10 million annual sales by 2030 and the rollout of 20% ethanol-blended petrol commenced this year. For decarbonising India, we are working on a mission mode on green hydrogen as an alternative,  he said.  The aim is to make India a global hub for the production, use, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives. Modi said the world is looking up to G20 energy ministers to advance a sustainable, just, affordable, inclusive, and clean energy transition, urging them to ensure that the global south is not left behind. We must ensure low-cost finance for developing countries. We must find ways to bridge technology gaps, promote energy security, and work on diversifying supply chains,  he said.He called for strengthening collaboration on 'Fuels for the future', adding that the 'High-level principles on hydrogen' is a step in the right direction.The prime minister said trans-national grid interconnections can enhance energy security, pointing to the mutually beneficial cooperation in South Asia that has shown encouraging results. It will enable all of us to meet our climate goals, stimulate green investment, and create millions of green jobs,  he said.  I invite you all to join the green grids initiative - 'One Sun, One World, One Grid of the International Solar Alliance',  he said, rounding up his address.",

        "articleBody": "Energy efficiency is the cornerstone of a just and equitable clean energy transition and a critical lever for the decarbonization of the global economy. Often referred to as the \u2018first fuel\u2019, energy efficiency is the easiest and most cost-effective way to simultaneously combat climate change, facilitate transitions to renewable energy, provide reliable and affordable energy access, support low-carbon economic growth, enhance the security of supply, and reduce dependency on imported energy sources.There are quick and local opportunities for energy efficiency, from household appliances to large-scale urban or industrial projects. Exploiting the potential for energy efficiency can deliver over 40% of the emission reductions needed to be in line with the Paris Agreement. Since 2015, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 7.3 has called for global progress on energy efficiency as part of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. However, energy efficiency progress is falling short of global goals, leaving large opportunities untapped. The energy intensity of the global economy only reduced by an average 1.8 percent per year between 2010 and 2020. To make up for lost ground and put the world on a pathway to achieve SDG 7.3 by 2030 and net-zero emission by 2050, this rate must double during this decade.As Energy Ministers from G20 countries gather in Goa to discuss energy transition priorities, a global and concerted effort is necessary to accelerate energy efficiency actions during this crucial decade. The good news is that track records show that it is both attainable and highly beneficial.Advancing energy efficiency globallyEnergy efficiency has been a long-term priority for many G20 countries, as shown through actions on a large basket of notable legislation, regulations, and policies to advance energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and transport sectors. Policies such as the REPowerEU Plan, the US Inflation Reduction Act, and Japan\u2019s Green Transformation Initiative, have demonstrated that ambitious energy efficiency progress is possible.Notable G20 initiatives have also sought to drive coordinated action, such as the G20 Energy Efficiency Leading Programme (2016) and the G20 Energy Efficiency Investment Toolkit (2017). In 2022, the Bali Energy Transitions Roadmap called for ambitious and collaborative G20 action on energy efficiency, and more recently, the G20 Indian Presidency unveiled the Strategic Plan for Advancing Energy Efficiency Across Demand Sectors by 2030. The Plan lays out recommended energy efficiency action priorities for this decade that can keep the G20 and countries in the world on track with SDG 7.3 and decarbonization commitments, including through the diffusion of knowledge and best practices.Global investments in energy efficiency \u2013 such as building renovations, public transport, and efficient equipment \u2013 reached $560 billion in 2022. This is a new record, yet it falls short of the $1.5 trillion in yearly average efficiency investments that are needed to shift from less efficient investments between 2026 and 2030 to achieve projected net zero emissions by 2050 scenarios. Moreover, there exists a regional imbalance in government-approved energy efficiency spending, with the majority of spending delivered in developed economies.The number of people without reliable access to heating, cooling, clean cooking, and other energy services has risen to around 2.5 billion worldwide, with an extra 160 million households pushed into energy poverty since 2019. Efficiency improvements, together with wind and solar power, can bridge energy access gaps and meet the world\u2019s commitments towards net zero emissions. At the same time, the largest energy efficiency investment opportunities will increasingly be found in emerging countries that are accounting for an ever-greater share of energy demand.The slow pace of improvement in energy efficiency is a major missed opportunity for the global community. Notably, energy efficiency has a high job creation potential, where data suggests that each US dollar invested in energy efficiency has the potential to create up to 15 green jobs. The global community must come together to elevate energy efficiency as a policy priority and mobilize coordinated support and low-cost financing towards energy efficiency and clean technologies, particularly in emerging and developing economies. Investment needs to be mobilized quickly by making strategic use of public funding to catalyze private investment in energy efficiency and by unlocking investments through innovative de-risking and financing models, including supporting energy service companies (ESCOs). To underpin these efforts, strengthening collaboration between governments to transfer key policy learnings across countries is of utmost importance.Leveraging on G20 processes and India\u2019s PresidencyIndia, as the current G20 Presidency, offers a unique opportunity to draw on rich experience in energy efficiency policies and strategies. Between 2010 and 2020, India has managed to reduce energy intensity faster than the global average, by over 2% per year. This progress is a result of several regulatory initiatives launched by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in sectors such as appliances, buildings, and industry. Additionally, India\u2019s public sector super ESCO - Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) - has led the world-renowned energy efficient lighting replacement programme, UJALA, where more than 365 million LED bulbs have been distributed at affordable prices, reducing households\u2019 electricity bills while also increasing jobs in domestic manufacturing of LED bulbs.During India's Presidency, the G20 is ideally positioned to leverage global momentum and chart the path for scaling energy efficiency investment. This can be done by leveraging the renewed global momentum for energy efficiency and existing global initiatives like Mission Efficiency, the Energy Efficiency Hub, and the IEA Technology Collaboration Programmes.The newly launched Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) movement by Prime Minister Modi is a testament to India\u2019s envisioned reform through community lifestyles, and a global blueprint to promote energy-efficient lifestyles and decision-making. It is estimated that 2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions reduction can be realized by 2030 if the LiFE mindset and policy focus towards behavioural interventions are widely implemented.No one can deliver on our energy and climate goals alone. Let us take this historic opportunity and make energy efficiency a common mission and global movement of governments, businesses, and citizens.Damilola Ogunbiyi is CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (UN SRSG) for Sustainable Energy for All, and Co-Chair of UN-Energy.",

        "articleBody": "It might be difficult to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7, or SDG7, with the International Energy Agency predicting that nearly 660 million people will not have access to electricity by 2030, a top government official said on Thursday, batting for decentralised renewable energy (DRE). Speaking on the sidelines of a G20 Energy Transitions Working Group meeting, R P Gupta, chairman and managing director of Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited, called DRE a potent solution to energy requirements. DRE sources include rooftop solar panels and similar production facilities located closer to the site of energy consumption. SDG 7 aims at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. Gupta said the gap in energy access was bridged by 300 million households between 2010 and 2020.  However, as per data from International Energy Agency, 660 million people will remain away from electricity even by 2030, which is also the deadline for all of us to achieve SDG7,  he said. Gupta said that the brunt of energy poverty is borne by poor households in rural and remote areas and mostly this appears in Africa and Asia.  The progress of attaining sustainable and equitable growth will become challenging if the quality and availability of energy sources are not met,  he said. Gupta said that the indicators of progress like health, education, employment, gender inclusion and even mental well-being are linked to universal access to clean energy. He said DRE is a potent solution to energy requirements.  Their decentralized nature allows them to tap the locally available energy resources,  Gupta said. He pointed out that in 2021, as per available data, 179 million people gained access to electricity through DRE solutions, up from 35 million in 2012.  These technologies address the most pressing challenges, support diverse energy needs and livelihood of a large population, help in reaching the last mile, especially in climate vulnerable geographies with unreliable connectivity and meet their increasing energy demand in climate responsible manner,  he said. Gupta said that to leverage the significant potential of DRE in the year when India is leading the G20 presidency, efforts are being made to support an ecosystem for scaling DRE integration for global energy transition.",

        "articleBody": "Stating that environmental causes accounted for less than a tenth of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding between 2015 and 2021, the India Climate Collaborative (ICC) on Thursday launched a dedicated platform to help funnel more resources for such purposes. The 'Earth Exponential' platform, which is backed by JSW Foundation, will bring together funders and non-profits and showcase credible, high-impact and India-led climate solutions, as per an official statement.  The statement said in the seven years to 2021, environment-related causes got Rs 6,183 crore of the overall funding of Rs 67,193 crore in CSR.  The platform will be curating, evaluating and displaying home-grown climate projects, and enabling them to scale by matching them to funders, it said.  It aims to reduce entry barriers for funders through simplified solution discovery and knowledge building, the statement said.   India's home-grown climate solutions offer immense potential to address climate change without leaving anyone behind,  ICC's chief executive Shloka Nath said, making clear that the platform will not charge a fee for matching up the funders with the projects.  ICC has been founded by corporate and philanthropic leaders, including Rohini Nilekani, Ratan Tata, Anand Mahindra and Sangita Jindal.   There is an urgent need to address the critical gaps that could pose challenges on our roadmap to achieve the target of net zero by 2070. Earth Exponential aims to address some of these challenges by bringing together funders and non-profit organisations to address and plug these critical gaps through innovative, homegrown solutions,  Sangita Jindal, the chairperson of JSW Foundation, said.",

        "articleBody": "Ahead of the energy and climate G20 ministerial in Goa and Chennai, ministers from 14 countries including the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, Vanuatu, Colombia, have under the banner of the High Ambition Coalition called on G20 hosts India and other members to agree on measures such as phasing out fossil fuel use to ensure that average increase in global temperature does not exceed 1.5\u00b0C compared to the 1850s.\u201cWe urge you, as leaders of the G20, to accelerate your efforts to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, to expand your cooperation and lead the way in phasing out all fossil fuels and in transitioning to a green sustainable energy future where access to energy is guaranteed for all,\u201d the ministers wrote in an open letter to the G20.The High Ambition Coalition (HAC), founded by the Marshall Islands, a Pacific island state, in 2014 is an informal grouping comprising developing and developed countries.Among the signatories of the letter are France, a member of the G20, and Denmark, a special invitee to the energy and climate ministerial meetings. Other signatories include Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Austria, Sweden, Chile.Stressing on the critical need to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, the ministers stressed the need to peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 at the latest, and to reduce emissions by 43%, from 2019 levels, by 2030.\u201cWe will not stay within 1.5\u00b0C without reducing fossil fuel production. Further fossil fuel expansion risks rendering the eventual transition more expensive and disruptive to economies and societies.The HAC ministers recognize the difficulties in phasing out fossil fuels. Several constituent countries are increasing their oil and gas production in response to energy security arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing war. \u201cPhasing out fossil fuels will not be easy, but humankind cannot afford to delay.\u201d Therefore, the ministers are calling on a G20 to take the lead. \u201cWe must bring the fossil fuel era to an end together and agree a plan to do this at COP28.\u201dAt COP27, held last year in Egypt, India had proposed and pushed for an agreement on phasing down of all fossil fuels . The Indian proposal had the support of nearly 80 countries. The European Union and small island states were early supporters. A veteran climate negotiations observer said \u201cgiven that India initiated the proposal to phase down all fossil fuels at COP27 and sought to build consensus on the issue at the 2022 G20 Leaders\u2019 Summit in Bali, it will leverage its presidency of G20 to renew its push for reducing the use of all fossil fuels.\u201dIn their letter, the ministers stressed ways to replace fossil fuels in the energy system such as increasing share of renewable energy and greater emphasis on energy efficiency. \u201cRenewable energy has the potential to replace fossil fuels, and to improve access to clean energy across the world, particularly the developing world. We also need a step change in energy efficiency, and to redirect fossil fuel subsidies as part of a just and equitable transition. We must agree and deliver global goals on renewable energy and energy efficiency, as part of a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned global energy strategy.\u201dIn their plan for COP28, hosts of this year\u2019s annual UN climate talks, the United Arab Emirates has called for tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030 . The HAC would like the G20 to endorse these goals.The ministers stress the need to focus on efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change. \u201cLife saving adaptation is needed worldwide\u201d. To this end, they call for \u201cenabling national adaptation planning and implementation, and removing the barriers we see today, is key, and will require international cooperation and support, including the delivery of the COP26 call to double adaptation finance.\u201dThe letter calls for support for \u201cthe swift operationalization and capitalization of loss and damage funding arrangements, and a fund for responding to loss and damage\u201d and improving climate finance flows through various efforts to reform international financial systems. Asking the G20 ministers to step up their efforts, the HAC ministers wrote, \u201cAll G20 members should demonstrate their commitment to living up to the Paris Agreement, Glasgow Climate Pact, and Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, and to protecting the lives of us all. This is the most critical decade, and an opportunity for us to chart a path to a more sustainable, safe, and liveable future for all.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "The global energy transition -- the shift from fossil-based fuels such as oil and coal to renewable sources like wind and solar -- is estimated to become a USD 23-trillion market by 2030, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Tuesday as American companies seek closer ties with Indian firms to tap this opportunity. Speaking at the ministerial meeting of the US-India Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) here, she said the US will have to add 2,000 gigawatts of clean energy to its electric grid by 2035 to meet the goal of using 100 per cent electricity from clean sources.   So that means we have to do everything, everywhere, all at once. And so in order to do that, we have to partner and we've got to learn from those who are doing it well and can scale (up) really well,  she said.  India has announced aims to reach net zero emissions by 2070 and to meet 50 per cent of its electricity requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030. It is targeting installing 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, reducing the emissions intensity of its economy by 45 per cent, and cutting a billion tonnes of CO2.  These common goals provide scope for cooperation, which led to the setting up of the SCEP.   We say, in the United States, this transformation, this transition, this explosion of clean energy is private sector-led government enabled,  she said.  And so it is very important that we hear from you who are doing it.   A  USD 23 trillion global market awaits us in terms by 2030. So there is a huge economic opportunity. And obviously, we cannot walk outside without realizing that we all share a home and our shared home requires us to help from all.   Speaking at the meeting, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said New Delhi greatly values this bilateral clean energy, strategic green energy partnership.  India-US energy trade in 2023 would be USD 20 billion, he said.  The United States is a very major partner in our energy cooperation today, even in the traditional areas, the amounts of gas we are buying and the potential this strategic clean energy partnership has an altogether new.   A joint statement issued after the ministerial said during the meeting, the two sides noted the growing importance of bilateral energy cooperation between the countries while underscoring the critical importance of clean energy engagement and the achievements of the SCEP in strengthening energy security, creating opportunities for clean energy innovation, addressing climate change and creating employment generation opportunities.   The sides renewed their commitment to work towards a just, orderly and sustainable energy transition, which prioritises access to reliable, affordable, and clean energy supply,  it said.  The two reviewed the ambitious and dynamic SCEP mandate, which over the years has deepened and strengthened collaboration across a wide breadth of clean energy work streams, including clean and renewable energy, energy efficiency, increased collaboration in emerging technologies like battery storage and swapping technologies, gas hydrates, advanced biofuels, and hydrogen and electrolyzer production.   In this context, the sides recognised the importance of producing green/clean hydrogen as a critical energy source for global decarbonisation and agreed to support each other's national hydrogen missions,  it said.  The two sides emphasized the importance of promoting energy access, affordability and energy justice in each country. They also acknowledged that successfully achieving ambitious climate and clean energy aspirations necessitates coordinated efforts on the development of energy transition roadmaps, capacity building, job skilling, and sharing of best practices at all levels of government.  In that context, the sides agreed to work toward the development of net zero villages in India to support the clean energy transition, the statement said.  Both sides launched the South Asia Group for Energy (SAGE) to deepen the engagement between Indian agencies and US national laboratories to support research, analysis and capacity-building activities such as building modelling capacity in Life Cycle Assessment of low carbon technologies and analytics on energy consumption in the building sector.",

We are close to reaching an agreement on the global minimum tax system,  said Yellen, after a bi-lateral meeting with India's finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the sidelines of a G20 meeting.The visit is Yellen's third to India this year, indicating the growing closeness between the two countries.The improvement in bilateral relations was highlighted during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to Washington last month which saw a slew of defence and high technology deals being signed.Yellen said the two nations have been collaborating across a range of economic issues, including commercial and technological collaboration and strengthening supply chains. In particular, we look forward to working with India on an investment platform to deliver a lower cost of capital and increased private investment to speed India's energy transition,  she said.Yellen will visit Vietnam after the G20 finance meetings end on July 18.",

        "articleBody": "REC, a subsidiary of Power Finance Corp., plans to expand its lending in the renewable energy space to Rs 2.4 lakh crore by 2030, says its director-technical, VK Singh. While land and grid availability can be challenging for developing new green energy projects, policies of the government and support from states have been encouraging, he tells Shilpy Sinha. Edited excerpts:The renewables space has been gathering pace. How is REC positioned considering India's target of achieving 500 GW capacity by 2030?India is at 175 GW and needs to add 325 GW by 2030. REC aims to build a renewable portfolio and explore opportunities in solar, wind, hydro, storage, hydrogen and methanol initiatives. We are financing pumped storage projects & hydrogen / ammonia projects and supporting e-mobility efforts. Recently, we raised $750 million through green bonds to finance green energy and clean transportation projects. We plan to expand our loan book in the renewable energy space and increase it to\u20b92.4 lakh crore by 2030. This year alone we aim to sanction \u20b975,000 crore to renewable energy and disburse \u20b9 30,000 crore, which will be 25% of our total disbursements.What is the kind of demand from the green hydrogen sector?REC is actively supporting the growth of the green hydrogen sector through various initiatives. We have provided funding for energy-related projects, expanded lending to infrastructure sectors, and are exploring opportunities in hydrogen and ammonia projects. For example, we have underwritten the entire debt amount of \u20b9 4,000 crore approximately for an ammonia project recently. REC recognises the potential of green hydrogen, considering India's competitive levelised cost of electricity for solar and wind compared to other countries, despite being a net importer of natural gas.How does the cost of green hydrogen compare?The declining cost of electrolysers and renewables makes it more beneficial to expand green hydrogen production in India rather than grey or blue hydrogen. Analysis indicates that the cost of green hydrogen could decrease from $5.5/kg to approximately $1.60/kg by 2030 and $0.70/kg by 2050. So, we see significant opportunities in this space.Power sector has had problems for the past many years. Has anything changed?The government's reforms have led to improved financial viability of the power sector. Schemes like RDSS (Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme), LPS (late-payment surcharge) and additional prudential norms have played crucial roles. While RDSS focuses on performance improvements in discoms, including timely tariff revisions and subsidy payments, the LPS scheme has reduced outstanding dues by 50% within a year, promoting timely payments. Similarly, additional prudential norms link loans to the performance of utilities, while the National Smart Grid Mission has reduced losses through real-time power flow control.Has the new late-payment surcharge scheme led to behavioural changes in discoms in payments to power companies?Yes, currently all discoms are paying dues to generation & transmission companies on time. State governments are actively involved in making discoms viable through timely subsidies and tariff revisions. The scheme has resulted in a 50% reduction in legacy dues to generation and transmission companies, expected to be paid fully by 2025. The legacy outstanding dues as on June, 2022 were 1.39 lakh crore, which have now come down to around \u20b970,000 crore. Also, all current bills are being paid within the deadline prescribed in rules.",

        "articleBody": "In order to aggregate demand, the government is likely to come out with a mandate on usage of green hydrogen in the country, secretary in the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said on Friday. The senior ministry official was addressing the International Conference on Green Hydrogen (ICGH-2023) in the national capital. The three-day conference concluded on Friday. We have a provision for that in the (hydrogen) mission. You know the energy conservation act has been amended and now there is a legal provision to enforce the mandate whenever it is decided. These are the kinds of enabling steps towards having a mandate as and when we decide, but we haven't decided yet,  Bhalla said in reply to a question on a mandate for usage of green hydrogen.The government is first trying to figure out whether it can collate demand, aggregate and make it more clear for the industry to set up production facilities and in due course of time in consultation with the concerned ministries and the sectors a call will be taken in this regard, he added.Bhalla said that export related topics were also discussed during a round-table at the conference. Singapore, Korea and Japan along with the EU participated in the round-table. Representatives of these countries, officials of the Indian government and industry players attended the session.Out of the planned green hydrogen production by 2030 under the mission, around 70 per cent would be for export, the secretary said.In January 2023, the Centre approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore with an aim to make India a global hub for manufacturing green hydrogen.The mission seeks to promote development of a production capacity of at least 5 MMT (Million Metric Tonne) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.The official also informed that in another round-table, various industry players, senior central government officials along with those of various coastal states participated. Against an expectation of 1,500, the event witnessed over 2,700 participants,  the secretary said.He further said the government is also working on skilling and re-skilling the workforce for smooth transition to green hydrogen.The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship will take steps in coordination with MNRE and other ministries for building skillsets ensuring employability in this sector. Suitable courses and programmes will be developed for skilling of manpower across the value chain, including manufacturing of equipment, green hydrogen project installation, and operations and maintenance.Other important areas like green finance of hydrogen projects, its storage, transport, codes, framework, research and development related topics, and pilot projects were also discussed.S S V Ramakumar, Director (R&D) at Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, said IOCL is working on a pilot project to run around 15 hydrogen-based buses in Delhi and NCR.Ashish Lele, Director, CSIR- National Chemical Laboratory, is working with the government on certain programmes on skilled workforce in green hydrogen space.",

        "articleBody": "India plans to develop carbon markets for renewables, green hydrogen, bio-fuels and clean mobility to facilitate carbon trading between green and polluting sectors.The Niti Aayog is drawing up a framework to expedite their development, a senior government official told ET.\u201cSale of carbon credits will help generate revenue, which can thus be used to fund sustainable energy projects and other environmental initiatives,\u201d the official said.The government is of the view that the growth of carbon markets will also create job opportunities and stimulate economic activity, the official said.Initially such markets could be voluntary carbon markets, which means the issuance, buying and selling of carbon credits will be on a voluntary basis. However, over a period of time the government could put in place a regulatory framework to develop compliance markets, which compel industries to trade carbon credits, thereby generating revenue.According to an official, carbon trading is needed as all countries including India are short on investments in green energy and the greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise though at a slower pace.A report released at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt last year said India recorded the highest growth rate in carbon emission among the world\u2019s major warming contributors. It had projected India\u2019s emissions to increase by 6% and that of the US by 1.5% while China and the European Union (EU) are projected to reduce their emissions by 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively.According to the United Nations Development Programme, carbon markets are trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.One tradable carbon credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas reduced, sequestered or avoided. When a credit is used to reduce, sequester or avoid emissions, it becomes an offset and is no longer tradable.As per the International Energy Agency, emissions of the climate-warming gas that were caused by energy production grew 0.9% to reach 36.8 gigatons in 2022.Though India\u2019s per capita emission was substantially lower at 1.9 tonnes in 2021, the country is fourth largest global emitter with 7.5% of the global emissions, after China (31%), the US (14%) and the EU (7.7%).",

        "articleBody": "The World Bank said on Friday it has approved $1.5 billion in financing to accelerate the development of India's low carbon energy sector. The financing will help India promote low-carbon energy by scaling up renewable energy, developing green hydrogen and stimulating climate finance for low-carbon energy investments, the bank said in a statement.  The program will support the successful implementation of the National Green Hydrogen Mission that aims to stimulate $100 billion in private sector investment by 2030,  said Auguste Tano Kouame, World Bank Country Director for India. The program aims to scale up renewable energy supply by reducing costs and improving power grid integration, while helping India reach its committed 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030. The government plans to issue bids for 50 GW of renewable energy each year from FY23-24 to FY27-28, which will avoid carbon emissions of 40 million tons per annum by 2026. That World Bank said that while India's per capita energy consumption was only one-third of the global average, demand was expected to grow rapidly with the expansion of the economy. This calls for a phasing down of fossil-based energy sources in line with India's goal of achieving net-zero by 2070, the statement added. ",

The $200 million loan has a final maturity of 14.5 years including a grace period of 4.5 years.The World Bank has joined hands with the Himachal Pradesh government in order to fulfill the state\u2019s aim of meeting 100 per cent of its energy needs through renewable and green energy by 2030.\u201cThe World Bank\u2019s Himachal Pradesh Power Sector Development Programme will help the state enhance the utilization of its existing RE resources, including hydropower, and help to diversify its RE resources further,\u201d the International body said in a release.For instance, it will add 150 megawatts of solar capacity in the state, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 190,000 metric tons per year.Auguste Tano Kouam\u00e9, the World Bank\u2019s Country Director for India, said that the programme will boost local economic activity while replacing fossil-fuel based energy consumption with green energy. \u201cMoreover, the programme will support Himachal Pradesh to set up a single energy trading desk, thus enabling the sale of surplus hydropower to other states,\u201d he added. While the programme will help achieve a strengthened transmission and distribution grid, it will also introduce advanced technologies such as a \u2018demand response management system\u2019 and seamless access to RE. This eliminates the dependency on fossil-fuel based power during peak load periods. The introduction of automated systems will ensure providing clean, reliable 24x7 power supply to citizens, thereby reducing power outages. \u201cHP power utilities will train around 700 female apprentices throughout the lifespan of the program, giving them hands-on exposure and training in technical roles within the power sector,\u201d the release stated.The World Bank believes that this program will set a template for the Indian Power market.",

According to a notification issued by the Environment Ministry, the Green Credit programme encourages private sector industries and companies as well as other entities to meet their existing obligations, stemming from other legal frameworks, by taking actions which are able to converge with activities relevant for generating or buying Green Credits.  The main objectives of the Green Credit Programme are to create a market based mechanism for providing incentives in the form of Green Credits to individuals, farmer producer organisations, cooperatives, forestry enterprises, sustainable agriculture enterprises, urban and rural local bodies, private sectors, industries and organisations for environment positive actions.  The programme also envisages to create a mass movement around environment positive actions and realise the vision of  Mission LiFE  through pro-planet people and entities.   A phased and iterative approach for implementation of the programme will be adopted. In the initial (phase) two to three activities from the sectors...will be considered for designing and piloting the programme and then more activities will be added from the selected sectors in subsequent phases,  the notification read.  Green Credits will arise from a range of sectors and entities, ranging from small-scale ones such as individuals, farmer producer organisations, cooperatives, forestry enterprises and sustainable agriculture enterprises to those being developed at the level of urban and rural local bodies, private sectors, industries and organisations, the notification said.  Green Credits will be tradable outcomes and will act as incentives. In the beginning, Green Credits will be made available to individual and entities, engaged in selected activities and who undertake environmental interventions. These Green Credits will be made available for trading on a domestic market platform.",

Financing clean energy in these nations is essential to reach international climate goals, said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The $260bn annual investment figure must rise to almost $2tn.

        "articleBody": "Financing for clean energy in developing and emerging economies excluding China must increase seven-fold within a decade if global warming is to be capped at tolerable levels, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday. To keep Paris climate temperature goals in play, annual investment for non-fossil fuel energy in these countries will need to jump from $260 billion to nearly $2 trillion, the intergovernmental agency said in a report.  Financing clean energy in the emerging and developing world is the fault line of reaching international climate goals,  IEA executive director Fatih Birol told journalists in a briefing Tuesday. The report comes on the eve of the two-day Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, which seeks to galvanise support for revamping the mid-20th century architecture governing financial flows from rich to developing nations. Speeding the transition from dirty to clean energy, and helping the Global South cope with and prepare for devastating climate impacts are high on the summit agenda.  Virtually all of the nearly 800 million people lacking electricity and the 2.4 billion without access to clean cooking fuels are in poor and emerging countries.  Under current policy trends, one third of the rise in energy use in these nations over the next decade will be met by burning fossil fuels, the main driver of global warming, the IEA warned.  Clean energy investments is increasing gradually -- this is a good news,  said Birol.  The bad news is that more than 90 percent of that increase in clean energy since the Paris Agreement in 2015 comes from advanced economies and China.   Only 10 percent comes from the emerging and developing countries,  he added.  We need to change this trend.  - Solar is cheapest - With China included in the calculation, private and public money pouring into renewables and other forms of carbon neutral energy will need to more than triple from $770 billion in 2022 to about $2.5 trillion per year by the early 2030s. Investment must remain at those levels until mid-century to help keep Earth's average surface temperature  well below  two degrees Celsius, and 1.5C if possible, the Paris climate treaty's binding and aspirational targets, respectively. The potential for rapidly ramping up renewable energy is there, according to the report. At least 40 percent of the global solar radiation reaching the planet lands on sub-Saharan Africa, and solar energy is now the cheapest source of electricity generation across almost the entire world. And yet, nearly ten times more solar PV capacity was installed last year in China -- some 100 GW -- than across the entire African continent. Sunny sub-Saharan Africa generates less solar electricity than the Netherlands, Birol noted. According to the report, two-thirds of the finance for clean energy projects in emerging and developing economies excluding China will need to come from the private sector.  Today's $135 billion in annual private financing for clean energy in these economies must rise to about a trillion a year within the next decade. To meet both climate and sustainability goals, clean energy investment in emerging and developing economies should be concentrated in four areas, according to the IEA. Just over a third should go into low-emissions generation, mainly solar and wind. Another third is needed to improve efficiency in end-use sectors, such as cooling and electric transport. A quarter is required for electricity grids and storage capacity, while just under 10 percent goes to low-emission fuels and so-called carbon, capture and storage (CCS), which removes CO2 from the exhaust of gas or coal power plants and heavy industry.",

        "articleBody": "The credit quality of India's large and rated renewable energy independent power producers (IPP) will reflect the different routes they have chosen for the next two to three years, said Moody's Investors Service in a report.According to Moody's, the paths chosen by the renewable energy IPPs will have a varying impact on their respective business and financial risk profiles. Investment in green hydrogen could lead to further differentiation.Of the eight rated Indian IPPs, the three leading producers by installed capacity -- Greenko Energy Holdings (GEH), Renew Power Private Limited (RPPL) and Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) -- each have installed generation capacity of over five gigawatts, which had grown via greenfield development and acquisitions, the report notes.This rapid growth had been bolstered by supportive government policies, the competitive cost of renewable power in India as well as the availability of low-cost debt.Moody's said AGEL's focus on delivering its large pipeline of plain vanilla renewable generation projects, which will help manage execution risk but could expose the group to rising costs.Conversely, RPPL and GEH have shifted their focus to firm supply generation and pumped storage projects, respectively, where competition is less intense. Such plans could help preserve profitability but may expose RPPL to fluctuations in merchant power prices, and keep GEH's financial leverage at higher levels for longer,  Moody's said.While GEH and RPPL have announced plans to make material investments to develop green hydrogen production capabilities both in India and abroad Moody's does not expect AGEL to invest in the new business directly, given that a separate joint venture has been established by the Adani Group to look at new energy opportunities.Investment in hydrogen -- if materialized as announced -- will significantly increase the IPPs' exposure to execution and funding risk beyond our current base case before countermeasures.Due to their capital spending and refinancing needs, the IPPs have weak liquidity but good access to capital markets in general.The outlook on two rated AGEL bonds expiring in late 2024 were revised to negative because of the uncertainty over AGEL's funding access, Moody's said.",

I see India as the leader of global south now. It is very clear. I am very hopeful that India will be able to break the deadlock of the finance in clean energy investment,  the IEA chief told ET.Birol has shepherded IEA into unchartered territories - modernising the agency by bringing in emerging economies into the fold and focusing on clean energy transition. This is because he believes  the energy sector has a big responsibility  in dealing with environmental and climate change issues in the world.  About 80% of the emissions causing climate change are from the energy sector,  Birol said.  Without transforming the energy sector, we have no chance whatsoever to address our climate problem. Many emerging economies and developing countries need energy for the development for industrialisation, more comfortable lives. And I thought it is important that without losing time, to show the right way to developing countries, so that they don't make the mistake that the advanced economies did.  Praising the  big, big, big efforts  of many emerging countries towards clean energy, the IEA chief said India serves as a validation in clean energy initiatives. India is  one of the locomotives engines of the renewable capacity growth around the world, especially solar , he said.At the same time, it is important to remember that affordability of energy and energy security are critical for developing countries, Birol said.  That is what we also say to the advanced economies, the rich countries - that it is their moral responsibility and in their own benefit that they support the clean energy transition in the emerging economies,  he said.The 65-year old Turkish economist and energy expert acknowledged that there are many challenges to reach the climate goals. But if he has to identify one measure that would help achieve the climate goals, then  the fault line is investments in clean energy in the developing world . ",

        "articleBody": "CAMDEN (NEW JERSEY): A leading Indian-American executive has expressed hope that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden would agree on a nuclear compact that will enhance bilateral cooperation on nuclear and solar technology that will help meet India's growing energy requirements and address pollution challenges. The remarks by Kris Singh, Executive Chairman and CEO of Holtec International, came ahead of Prime Minister Modi's first Official State Visit to the US next week.  We have developed here a small nuclear reactor and we are now ready to sell it commercially. My hope is that we will provide this reactor in significant quantities in India. That will change the landscape. I get excited when I talk about it because it really is a phenomenal solution,  Singh told PTI in an exclusive interview at the sprawling Krishna P Singh Technology Campus here. Holtec International is a diversified energy technology company recognized as the leading technology innovator in the field of carbon-free power generation, specifically commercial nuclear and solar energy. Singh underlined the potential for enhanced collaboration between India and the US in the energy sector, particularly nuclear technology that can help the world's most populous country meet its energy requirements while at the same time addressing challenges of pollution in its cities and towns and ensuring clean air for its citizens. Singh, who is a prolific inventor and has 170 patents granted in the US as well as a large number overseas, with many patents pending, said he developed the small nuclear reactor 10-12 years ago.  We have developed the technology to use solar energy along with nuclear plants to produce more power than solar alone could do,  underlining that this is a  comprehensive solution.  Singh noted that while all power plants need water to run, his company's reactor will run on air.  If you have to produce power in the middle of Rajasthan, where there is very little water, you can use this reactor. It produces power but no pollution. That's what we need across the country,  Singh said. Singh emphasised that India has  a wonderful gift of the sun  and noted that Prime Minister Modi has called for 'One Sun, One World, One Grid' to improve the viability of solar power.  India is well-endowed with much solar energy,  he said adding that he is hoping that Prime Minister Modi  works out a nuclear compact with the US so it becomes possible for us to provide the technology to India.  He noted that right now he cannot do this since restrictions on nuclear technology are  very very strict. There is so much that can be done using nuclear and solar to decongest the environment in India.  Singh emphasised that as India undertook its phenomenal development journey over the years, the environment deteriorated and there is an urgent need to clean up the country's air. This would entail switching to two clean energy sources there are - nuclear and solar. Singh stressed that due to restrictions under the 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 810, companies like his are prohibited from using any Indian engineers to work on reactor development in the US.  We cannot do agreements to build plants there  and  My ambition is to build 100 of the Small Modular Reactors (SMR-160) in the next 15 years. I can't build one without the agreement,  he said as he expressed hope that Prime Minister Modi and President Biden would arrive at an agreement that will authorise India under Part 810. He said this does not require Congress' approval and the US President and his administration can do it.   It is inhibiting trade between India and US. We can be the agent to further strengthen the relationship between India and US,  he said. Singh, who came to America from India almost 55 years ago, established Holtec International in 1986 and built it into a multi-national company that has a business footprint globally on five continents. Singh built the USD 312 million Krishna P. Singh Technology Campus, a sprawling manufacturing facility, on the Delaware River in Camden, New Jersey in 2017 with the aim to create employment and economic growth in the area. The technology campus occupies approximately 50 acres of land on the left bank of the Delaware River in south Camden where the famed New York Shipyard (now a major cargo port operated by the South Jersey Port Authority) once stood. In establishing the Krishna P Singh Technology Campus, Holtec International sought to recapture South Jersey's  faded glory as a bastion of manufacturing and, in a larger measure, to help resuscitate America's shrunken base of heavy manufacturing,  the company says on its website. The campus consists of two large manufacturing plants, a seven-story corporate engineering centre, a system test facility (without nuclear fuel), and support installations like a training centre, a non-destructive testing laboratory, and corporate apartments. Lauding India's economic rise and potential to be among the world's top three economies in the near future, Singh said he is  confident it will be a wonderful time  for India. He said eliminating poverty, which India is doing remarkably well, has to be the  number one objective . Singh emphasised that skills training for the country's large young population is absolutely essential.  For the size of the country, it does not have the skilled labour pool  and if young people are not trained, they're not productive and become a  burden .  India has a great opportunity right now because its population is a young population. Train people, put them to work,  he said. Singh underscored that US policy towards India is different today than it was in the 1970s.  It's a new day. And I think that people in America look at India as a friend. We should build on that. ",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s energy transition plans offer a $500 billion investment opportunity for companies through the end of the decade, as the nation seeks a record expansion in clean power, Sumant Sinha, Chief Executive Officer at ReNew Energy Global Plc, said.The nation, the world\u2019s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has set a target to nearly triple its generation capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030. To reach that goal, the government plans to auction 50 gigawatts of wind, solar and hybrid projects every year, offering companies, such as ReNew, a massive opportunity, Sinha told Bloomberg Television in an interview Wednesday.Besides building wind and solar power projects, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is also seeking investments in domestic manufacturing of solar panels to make India self-reliant. The government has also embarked on a plan to make India a global hub for production of green hydrogen to tap a market for decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries.ReNew has plans to invest in the entire decarbonization chain. The company, with about 8 gigawatts of operational capacity, is among India\u2019s top renewables producers and it\u2019s now building a 4-gigawatt a year solar modules manufacturing plant that will become operational this year, Sinha said. The company is doing feasibility studies on a green hydrogen plant in Egypt and exploring other geographies for such projects.The government\u2019s plan to levy import taxes on cells and modules, although a cause of \u201ctemporary disruption\u201d in supplies, will serve the country well, positioning it as an alternative to China in solar module supplies, Sinha said.India last year applied a 40% import tax on modules and 25% on cells to lure investments in domestic manufacturing of these components and reduce the dependence on China. Border tensions between the two nations have emboldened calls in India to reduce trade with China.The world\u2019s most populous country has a steep hill to climb to fully achieve its energy transition project. Even with considerable advances in renewable energy, India still relies on coal for roughly three-quarters of power generation, and will need it for years to come.--With assistance from Sylvia Klimaki, Francine Lacqua and Tom Mackenzie.",

        "articleBody": "India will offer Rs 3,760 crore ($455.2 million) in incentives to companies setting up battery storage projects totaling 4,000 megawatt hours (MWh) under a scheme announced earlier this year, two government sources said. The scheme is intended to boost battery storage projects critical to India's ambitious plan to expand its renewable energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and cut the cost of battery energy storage from the current 5.5-6.5 rupees per unit. Battery storage, used to back up intermittent renewable power supply to stabilise the grid, is an evolving technology, and there are very few large-scale operational projects in the world. The scheme intends to develop large-scale battery energy storage systems to bring down costs through competitive bidding. The government will provide so-called viability gap funding - incentives to cover risks of developers of critical infrastructure projects that are or may turn out to be economically unviable - in the form of grants for three years, the sources said. It also expects private investments worth 56 billion rupees through the scheme. The disbursement of the contracts will be made in five tranches until 2030-31, one of the sources said, requesting anonymity since the proposal is not yet public and needs federal cabinet approval. Contracts will be awarded through a competitive process, with the company with lowest bid selected, they said. India's power ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A number of Indian conglomerates including Reliance Industries, Adani Power and JSW Energy have plans to set up large-scale battery plants. The proposal, announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech on Feb. 1, will next be taken up for decision by the country's cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. No timeline for the approval has yet been given. India has 37 MWh of battery storage capacity currently. According to estimates from its power sector planning body, it requires 236 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery energy storage in addition to 27 GW pump storage projects by 2031-32.",

        "articleBody": "The government is planning to revamp the electronic waste policy, focusing on complete lifecycle management of products and offering incentives to make it an attractive proposition for the industry, said officials. The revised policy could allow the industry to take into account the total volume of electronics products recycled instead of the amount of metals and rare earth minerals extracted from these products, they said.The Niti Aayog and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) have held multiple stakeholder consultations to firm up the policy and it may be released soon, said the officials. The e-waste policy this time will aim to address issues related to collection of waste, producer's responsibility and other policy related issues not adequately addressed earlier,  a senior government official at NITI Aayog told ET on condition of anonymity.E-waste, generated from discarded electronic items, is rich in rare earth minerals and metals including gold, silver, copper and aluminium. 100338176MeitY officials said the revised approach will be to encourage companies to look at the complete lifecycle management of products through the concept of a circular economy. While the government may think of incentives, it is likely to change the approach and give incentives on the number of electronic products recycled instead of the volume of metal and rare earth minerals extracted from the product,  said a MeitY official, who did not wish to be identified, adding that the policies around e-waste earlier did not have the desired impact as they focused more on the extraction of rare earth metals and minerals.It is estimated that e-waste in India is growing at the rate of 10% annually and major recycling of e-waste continues to be in the non-formal sector using primitive and hazardous methods.According to the Global E-Waste Monitor 2020 report, India generated 3.2 million tonnes of e-waste in 2019, ranking third after China (10.1 million tonnes) and the United States (6.9 million tonnes). India collected just 10% of the e-waste estimated to have been generated in the country in 2018-19 and 3.5% of that generated in 2017-18, said a recent report by the Central Pollution Control Board.According to estimates from Frost & Sullivan, the total amount of e-waste in India is estimated to reach at least 11.5 million metric tonnes by 2025. India has nearly 450 registered e-waste recyclers. Experts also suggest that the e-waste management sector is likely to grow at a compound annual growth rate of up to 14% in revenue till 2025.",

India is representing the voice of global south and our priority is that energy transition is done in a manner that we fulfil energy requirement, ensure energy security, and nobody is left behind,  Kumar said on the sidelines of the third leg of the group's meeting.The deliberations of the working group are around six priority areas - technological gap for energy transition, mobilising low-cost financing, energy security and diversified supply chains, fuel for future, energy efficiency measures and just energy transition.The members agreed to promote fuels of the future - including green and near-clean hydrogen and biofuels, he said.Technologies such as carbon capture and utilisation, high-efficiency fuel cells and electrolysers, modular reactors and alternative chemistry for batteries have also been agreed upon, he said.Deliberations on low-cost financing will be discussed during meetings that are being planned before the fourth and final leg, he added. We are negotiating with developed countries with regard to what they had promised at the time of the Paris Agreement - that they need to give more concessional funding, long-term low interest funding to developing countries for deployment of clean energy tech,  he said.Discussions are on over energy transition and climate change in the preamble of joint communique.GREEN HYDROGENThe definition for green hydrogen has not been decided yet, but there is consensus over need for international standards. The details need to be discussed further, Kumar said.",

        "articleBody": "NITI Aayog has proposed the government to go for blended financing and green bonds to attract private sector investment in setting up small modular reactors to decarbonise India\u2019s energy sector. Further, it has proposed a review of the existing nuclear regulatory framework to make it more comprehensive to accommodate various kinds of SMR technologies and designs which are at different stages of research and development. The recommendations are part of the NITI Aayog\u2019s report on The Role of Small Modular Reactors in Energy Transition, jointly prepared by the Aayog and the Department of Atomic Energy.As per the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the SMRs are advanced nuclear reactors with a power generation capacity ranging from less than 30 MWe to 300+ MWe. According to the report, SMRs have emerged as preferred nuclear energy option compared to large reactors as they require low inventory of nuclear material per reactor, speedy fabrication through standardization, fast realization using modularization techniques, feasibility of deployment at difficult sites and phased capital expenditure by adding successive batches of SMR modules. This, it said, makes SMRs an emerging technology to provide clean electricity, hydrogen and process heat. \u201cSMRs can provide stable baseload electricity and have the capability to operate flexibly to support integration of variable renewable energy into the grid,\u201d it said. Further, these can also serve nonelectric applications such as desalination and district heating while micro SMRs can be used to supply electricity as well as heat for communities in remote locations. \u201cHarnessing nuclear energy is a capital intensive process, and public investments alone will likely fall woefully short of the requirements, Suman Bery, vice chairman of NITI Aayog said, adding that the multi-trillion dollar decarbonisation process needs to be steered by private investment. According to Bery, public policy and regulations are the cornerstone for the establishment of an industrial ecosystem. \u201cHence, it is imperative that the harmonisation of regulations, codes and standards for emerging technologies that have global value chains is taken up on a fast-track mode,\u201d he added. According to the report, private sector participation in SMR deployment can be encouraged through half-a-dozen incentives including political support for SMR initiative, conducive SMR regulatory framework led by national regulators and a mature nuclear supply chain. \u201cA successful \u2018proof of concept/demonstration can drive investor confidence/ business case,\u201d it said, adding the need for an unambiguous Civil Nuclear Liability Framework and supporting legal structure and an effective energy policy framework and incentives for low-carbon technologies to push the deployment of SMRs. \u201cAvailability of low-cost finance, green finance and incorporation of nuclear energy into green taxonomy can improve the economics of SMR projects,\u201d it said, adding that de-risking SMR projects and establishing attractive financing frameworks such as blending finance, green bonds, etc. is pivotal for incentivizing private investors.

        "articleBody": "Just as the machine-smashing Luddites of the 19th century were wrong about the consequences of technical progress for jobs, so may be the champions of the more recent theory of \u201cdegrowth.\u201d Sold as our best chance against global warming, it threatens to trap 80% of the world\u2019s population at living standards the developed world would never tolerate.In the 1970s, the Romanian mathematician Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen posited a thermodynamic rule for when humankind exhausts its supply of fossil fuel. Economic activity, he said, would inevitably slow to a level supportable by solar flows. A corollary of that idea is that since in most places the sun shines for only half a day, billions of people in Asia, Latin America and Africa should simply accept that if they tried to get as rich as people in the West, their lands, livelihoods and lives would be visited by all the freaky calamities associated with climate change: heat waves, droughts, flash floods, coastal sinking and bleaching of coral reefs. A utopian social movement has coalesced for some time around ending the post-World War II obsession with gross domestic product and replacing it with \u201cgood domestic product\u201d \u2014 output that excludes bad stuff like wars and ecological disaster. The concept has support in Europe, where half the population is older than 44 years. But developing nations aren\u2019t convinced that GDP growth is a problem just when it\u2019s their time to be the epicenter of production and consumption. Although China is also aging and slowing, it\u2019s still an upper-middle-income country, not a rich nation. India is a lot younger, and poorer.The two emerging giants have more than just an ideological point. In their view, technology can even now enable people everywhere to aspire to a more prosperous life next year \u2014 and the year after \u2014 without destroying the planet.To see why the optimists may be right, I went to visit a $3.5 billion science experiment in Kurnool, a remote, hilly district in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The project site nominally falls in a forest, though it\u2019s mostly just barren, rocky land.Work was in full swing on the eight turbines that would, by this time next year, rotate and generate current when water comes gushing down at them from an artificial reservoir. This water, held initially in a lower receptacle, will get pumped up to the upper lake by power harvested from the sun and the wind. Nature\u2019s bounty would be converted into potential energy before it\u2019s released into electricity via kinetic energy. The technical name for this is pumped-storage hydropower. Europe calls it a water battery. The grid, supplied by the 816-megawatt solar park in the project\u2019s vicinity, will get steady round-the-clock power, just as it would from a coal- or gas-fired plant. But minus any pollution. Water storage will boost the efficiency of solar to 80%-plus, a fourfold increase.     100263936The project, which will effectively turn 4,000 megawatts of intermittent solar and wind energy into firm, schedulable power, is being run by Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli. The tech entrepreneurs, who met in London in the late 1990s, wanted to return home to India armed with European environmental technologies. Brainstorming sessions at The Pepper Pot, a pub near Tower Bridge, drove the pair headlong into the post-Kyoto Protocol zeitgeist of carbon credits. Greenko Group Plc, the firm they listed in 2007 on AIM, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s market for small and midsized companies, ventured into biomass, hydro, wind and solar. (Chalamalasetty also bought the pub after he realized their bills alone were enough to cover the mortgage.)By 2017, the duo had delisted from AIM, raised money from the sovereign wealth funds of Singapore and Abu Dhabi, and set up in Kurnool what back then was the world\u2019s largest, single-location solar farm, spread over 24 square kilometers (9 square miles), or about 3,500 soccer fields. But then, the cofounders stepped back. There wasn\u2019t much joy, they decided, in merely producing the next green electron for power utilities. What the world really needed was the next green molecule. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be in the gigawatt game,\u201d Kolli told me. \u201cWe focused on decarbonization via re-industrialization.\u201dImagine making heavy, polluting materials like steel, aluminum and plastics with clean energy tapped as a service. Chalamalasetty, a computer science graduate, likes using metaphors from the software industry. \u201cWe\u2019re building the world\u2019s largest energy storage cloud platform,\u201d he says. Just as cloud-stored email comes to our phones when we need it, industrial customers can access renewable power any time of the day or night. It\u2019s already happening. Starting June next year, ArcelorMittal SA\u2019s Indian joint venture with Nippon Steel Corp. plans to cut 1.5 million tons of carbon emissions annually by taking as much as a fifth of the power need of its plant in Gujarat state from the facility I visited in Andhra Pradesh. Aluminum maker Hindalco Industries Ltd. will run smelters with 24x7 green energy, reducing another 680,000 tons of emissions every year.     100263950In India and nearly everywhere else, utilities are the main customers of solar and wind power. But electricity is only one part of our carbon footprint. Using inexhaustible resources to reboot vital industries may offer an escape route from Georgescu-Roegen\u2019s entropy law. The only glitch is that renewable power isn\u2019t always available. Storing it for when the sun doesn\u2019t shine or wind doesn\u2019t blow requires huge batteries that must be cheaper, safer and longer-lasting than the lithium-ion variety used in electric vehicles. That\u2019s where the physics of pumped-storage comes in \u2014 supplemented by the chemistry of ammonia.Every year, farmers use a big chunk of the 175 million tons of ammonia, or NH3, produced at a great cost to the environment due to the massive amounts of carbon dioxide released in the underlying industrial process known as Haber-Bosch. But while agriculture needs ammonia for its nitrogen, a crop nutrient, Greenko is interested in NH3 as a carrier of three hydrogen atoms, cleanly produced.As a feedstock and fuel, hydrogen has the potential to be the chief building block of the next Industrial Revolution.    100263975Traditionally, most of our hydrogen has come from hydrocarbons. Gray and brown H2, produced from gas and coal, is the 94-million-ton-a-year bedrock of fertilizers, plastics, textiles, and a lot else besides. While it feeds and clothes us, it\u2019s also highly polluting. Blue hydrogen, derived from natural gas with the residual carbon dioxide captured, is what countries like Saudi Arabia are pushing as an cleaner alternative. But the breakthrough lies in sidestepping carbon altogether.The hydrogen we need is the green version, extracted from water and not hydrocarbons. The energy required to split open the water molecule will be solar or wind, arriving in electrolyzers via water batteries. Extract hydrogen from water, synthesize it with nitrogen using an electrical, rather than methane-fed, Haber-Bosch process, and you have carbon-free ammonia. It can be transported more easily and safely than shipping hydrogen as a gas or liquid. Then, either use the green ammonia to make fertilizers or break it up in a cracker into hydrogen with the help of a catalyst and more renewable energy, and use it in a fuel cell. What will be left behind will once again be just H2O \u2014 water.It\u2019s this green variant of H2 that would truly transform global trade by prizing open up the cozy club of energy exporters. Ethiopia is awash with photovoltaic potential, as are Pakistan and Somalia. Selling today\u2019s sunshine won\u2019t leave a poor nation worse off tomorrow. The usual socioeconomic concerns with resource extraction won\u2019t apply. An electric-vehicle revolution doesn\u2019t exactly pass the test. Keeping EVs affordable means intense mining for lithium, cobalt, and nickel, something that\u2019s already proving to be problematic: The Chilean government plans to demand a controlling stake in all future lithium projects; cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo has ignited worries about modern-day slavery. By comparison, switching to green hydrogen to save the planet is unlikely to cause new headaches. Replacing the entire current global production of conventional H2 with its electrolytic cousin would require roughly 0.09% of freshwater withdrawals, according to BloombergNEF, an improvement over the status quo.The 24x7 renewable energy required for H2O electrolysis could come from pumped-storage units where water is swapped between two custom-made reservoirs that don\u2019t rely on rivers for a refill. These are cheaper and faster to build than half a century ago, when Europe and the US started exploiting the height difference between two natural lakes. The original aim was to help nuclear-power plants, which couldn\u2019t ramp up or down, deal with night-time demand drop. The newer-vintage water batteries are larger and more ambitious. They can last for half a century, without emitting noxious fumes. As for carrying green H2 around the world, ammonia, the \u201ctransport battery,\u201d could be put on ships that are themselves powered by carbon-free NH3. None of this stuff is science fiction; the first of those vessels may arrive in a year or two.The new hydrogen-centric economy is attracting funding. According to BloombergNEF, annual H2 demand may quintuple to 500 million tons by 2050. Generation plans need a huge boost. To get there, the US has earmarked $9.5 billion in grants and announced production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. Germany will spend $21 billion by 2026. The Port of Rotterdam is studying the feasibility of an ammonia cracker. South Korea is building a green ammonia-import terminal.Green hydrogen could also cut down the outsize role of oil and gas in geopolitics. There will be less human conflict over finite hydrocarbons. The wars that get counted in GDP would give way to better-quality national income, answering at least one criticism of the modern way of life by the advocates of degrowth. For a true revolution, however, the economics must work out for everyone. India alone consumes 7 million tons of gray H2 annually \u2014 more than all of Europe combined. Industrial customers in poor countries can\u2019t pay $6 for a kilogram of green hydrogen. Nor can their taxpayers afford to slash that price by half by mimicking the US subsidy. This gridlock may keep re-industrialization a pipe dream. The good news is that developing nations are replying to the challenge. One kilo of green H2 selling for $1 within a single decade, what the Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani calls his \u201c1-1-1\u201d vision, may be too far-fetched. Geenko\u2019s more realistic goal is to beat liquefied natural gas, the source of gray H2. Once known as the champagne of fuels, LNG is better for the environment than coal, but its price can be erratic. Last year, Asian importers, from India and Bangladesh to Thailand and the Philippines, were being asked to pay $30 or more per million British thermal units because of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. That\u2019s roughly equivalent to $6 for a kilo of gray hydrogen. Greenko ZeroC Pvt., a subsidiary of the Indian firm, expects to deliver a green version, produced with round-the-clock renewable power, at $3 without subsidies. It\u2019s confident of meeting that price because of the low cost of pumped-storage hydro. Lithium-ion batteries, anyway unsuitable for long-duration storage, will be more than three times as expensive at current prices.The physics of the water battery, fused with the chemistry of ammonia, may offer the best chance to rewire production, trade and consumption without accepting a decline in living standards, or raising the temperature so much more than 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrialization levels that life for most people once again becomes nasty, brutish and short, if not downright impossible.India gets a bad rep for contributing to that dystopian future because of its reluctance to retire coal. What critics miss is the behind-the-scenes work it\u2019s putting in. The state-owned NTPC Ltd., the country\u2019s largest power producer, recently invited bids for 9,000 megawatt-hours of round-the-clock storage of wind and solar electricity. The biggest US facility, by contrast, will only stock 3,000 megawatt-hours after an upgrade. One of its battery packs caught fire last year.Climate leadership is moving east, but in a cooperative manner very different from how colonial powers had violently shifted the center of economic gravity westward in the 1800s. Greenko and Uniper SE are pursuing a deal under which the Indian firm\u2019s ZeroC unit will supply the German utility 250,000 tons of green ammonia annually. Korea\u2019s Posco Holdings Inc. wants to crack ammonia into H2 for its steel plants. Singapore wants to build ammonia bunkers for the shipping industry. ZeroC has entered into an agreement with the city-state\u2019s Keppel Infrastructure Holdings Pte. to explore building a factory together. With Belgium-based John Cockerill, ZeroC is setting up a gigafactory to make electrolyzers that would split water into hydrogen and oxygen.Greenko has its headquarters in Hyderabad, a three-hour drive from Kurnool. The thriving metropolis of 10 million people is a testament to the kind of growth most cities in India are yearning for. GIC Pte, the sovereign fund of Singapore, owns a majority stake in Greenko, which also has a billion-dollar investment from Japan\u2019s Orix Corp. Access to global capital is allowing cofounders Chalamalasetty and Kolli to work off a Chinese template. China is rushing to meet its goal of 200 pumped-hydro facilities with a combined capacity of 270 gigawatts by 2025. Assuming nine-hour storage, that\u2019s 2,430 gigawatt-hours of electricity, more than 24 times what Greenko is constructing and developing across seven locations. That shows two things: One, China is reading the tea leaves right. As Europe seeks to put a fair price on the carbon footprint of imports, the world\u2019s lowest-cost producer of goods will be ready to meet the challenge. Two, India needs to catch up. Almost 45% of the workforce is stuck in low-wage agriculture, and the number has risen because of the pandemic. Without rapid urbanization, tens of millions of Indians will be left stranded as surplus farmhands. The question is whether the energy they guzzle on their way to a better life will be as reliable as coal and cheaper than imported gas \u2014 and if it will be environment-friendly.At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021, India promised a 45% cut in the carbon intensity of its economy by 2030, compared with the levels in 2005. That pledge won\u2019t be met by replacing coal-fired electricity with more solar and wind. India has auctioned an average of 15 gigawatts of renewables capacity annually in the last five fiscal years. In the next four, the government wants to triple that number. Merely flooding utilities with cleaner power during non-peak hours won\u2019t make growth carbon-free. It may only leave the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy with wasted electricity and collapsed grids.Storing sunlight cheaply when it\u2019s not needed and using it in a reimagined industrial supply chain may be the only sustainable path. If 1.4 billion people can achieve a responsible transition to high-middle-income status, rich and poor nations alike will grow a keener interest in the trinity of solar power, water batteries and green hydrogen \u2014 transported over large distances as ammonia. That will also go a long way in diminishing the halo around degrowth. Even Georgescu-Roegen, who died in 1994, would have been dismissive of holding nations down. \u201cNot only growth,\u201d he theorized, but \u201ceven a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.\u201d His pessimism was rather more fundamental: \u201cPerhaps the destiny of man is to have a short but fiery, exciting, and extravagant life rather than a long, uneventful, and vegetative existence,\u201d he wrote in 1975. \u201cLet other species \u2014 the amoebas, for example \u2014 which have no spiritual ambitions inherit an earth still bathed in plenty of sunshine.\u201d Proving him wrong may well be the humankind\u2019s biggest preoccupation in this century.",

        "articleBody": "Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has taken major reforms in the 'Approved List of Models and Manufactures for Solar Photovoltaic Modules' (ALMM) including a sharp 80 per cent reduction in application fee as well as doubling enlisting validity. The MNRE has come up with a number of reforms in its ALMM mechanism for Solar Photovoltaic Modules, a ministry statement said.  The reforms are primarily aimed at reducing the cost to solar PV manufacturers, time between application to enlistment as well as compliance burden and increasing ease of doing business in the whole ALMM process.  The major reforms include the reduction in application fee by 80 per cent; a substantial reduction in inspection fee, with a reduction in certain cases being as high as 70 per cent and an exemption from factory inspection in case of enlistment of additional models in ALMM which are similar to those already enlisted by the applicant, but having lower wattage.  The reforms also included allowing the manufacturers to withdraw applications prior to factory inspection, with a refund of 90 per cent of the application fee and an increase in ALMM enlistment validity from two years to year years.  The ministry also provided for a grant of provisional enlistment in ALMM within seven days of receipt of BIS registration and a time limit of two months for factory enlistment and final enlistment, failing which deemed enlistment.  All future ALMM applications to be accompanied by a scanned copy of applications and processing of ALMM applications will start without waiting for the submission of hard copies, which can be submitted subsequently, the ministry provided.  The reforms provide for end-use category-wise minimum module efficiency thresholds for enlistment in ALMM.  For instance the Utility/ Grid Scale Power Plants will have at least 20 per cent module efficiency.  Similarly, the rooftop and solar pumping will have at least 19.50 per cent module efficiency and the benchmark for solar lighting will be 19 per cent.  New and Renewable Energy Secretary B S Bhalla said that the changes in the ALMM for photovoltaic modules would enhance the ease of doing business and help in ramping up the domestic production of solar photovoltaic modules for catering to the current and future demand.   The PLI Scheme has resulted in not only boosting the domestic manufacturing capacity of solar modules but also vertical integration of the value chain in India. We have already declared the bid trajectory of inviting bids of 50 GW renewables each year for the next 5 years. This includes 40 GW of Solar energy capacity.   The bid trajectory is aimed at providing a fillip to the RE manufacturing industry in the country by indicating the demand that would be created. The easing of the ALMM charges and regulations is a step in the direction of enhancing the Ease of Doing Business, lessening the compliance burden and reducing the charges incurred in various processes of listing under ALMM,  Bhalla said.  Since solar PV power installations are set up for a period of 25 years and solar PV cells and modules used in plants require long term warranty, it is desirable to ensure that such products are indeed made in units in which production has been claimed.  It is possible that some units may claim production of solar cells & modules produced or made elsewhere.  The reliability of producer is essential to protect the consumer interests and ensure larger energy security of the Country.  Accordingly, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) issued  Approved Models and Manufacturers of Solar Photovoltaic Modules (Requirement for Compulsory Registration) Order, 2019  on January 2, 2019.  The ALMM Order states that ALMM shall consist of LIST-I, specifying models and manufacturers of Solar PV Modules and LIST-II, specifying models and manufacturers of Solar PV Cells.  The first ALMM List for solar PV modules was issued on March 10, 2021. ALMM List for solar PV cells has not yet been issued.  Only the models and manufacturers included in ALMM List-I (of solar PV modules) are eligible for use in Government Projects/ Government assisted Projects/ Projects under Government Schemes & Programmes/ Open Access / Net-Metering Projects, installed in the country, including Projects set up for sale of electricity to Government under the Guidelines issued by Central Government under section 63 of Electricity Act, 2003 and amendment thereof.  The word 'Government' includes Central Government, State Governments, Central Public Sector Enterprises, State Public Sector Enterprises and, Central and State Organizations / Autonomous bodies.  However, from March 10, 2023, the ALMM order has been kept in abeyance for one financial year, i.e. FY 2023-24. Thus, projects commissioned by March 31, 2024 will be exempted from the requirement of procuring solar PV modules from ALMM.  As on date, the ALMM List consists of 91 no of module manufacturing facilities (all domestic) with their aggregate solar PV module manufacturing capacity of 22,389 MW per year.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Union ministries of power and environment, forests & climate change will develop a carbon credit trading scheme for decarbonisation. The government plans to develop the Indian Carbon Market (ICM) where a national framework will be established with an objective to decarbonise the Indian economy by pricing the Green House Gas (GHG) emission through trading of the carbon credit certificates, a power ministry statement said.  The Bureau of Energy Efficiency under the Ministry of Power along with Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change are developing the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme.  A one-day 'Stakeholder Consultation on Accredited Carbon Verifiers under ICM' was organised in the national capital on Thursday.  Currently, India has an energy savings-based market mechanism and the new avatar scheme will enhance the energy transition efforts with an increased scope that will cover the potential energy sectors.  For these sectors, the GHG emissions intensity benchmark and targets will be developed, which will be aligned with India's emissions trajectory as per climate goals, as per the statement.  The trading of carbon credits will take place based on the performance against these sectoral trajectories.  Further, it is envisaged that there will be a development of a voluntary mechanism concurrently, to encourage GHG reduction from non-obligated sectors.   The ICM will enable the creation of a competitive market that can provide incentives to climate actors to adopt low-cost options by attracting technology and finance towards sustainable projects that generate carbon credits.   It can be a vehicle for mobilising a significant portion of investments required by Indian economy to transition toward low-carbon pathways,  Abhay Bakre, Director General of BEE, said.  The ICM will develop methodologies for estimation of carbon emissions reductions and removals from various registered projects, and stipulate the required validation, registration, verification, and issuance processes to operationalise the scheme.  Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV) guidelines for the emissions scheme will also be developed after consultations.  A comprehensive institutional and governance structure will be set up with specific roles of each party involved in the execution of the ICM.  The ICM will mobilise new mitigation opportunities through demand for emission credits by private and public entities.  A well-designed, competitive carbon market mechanism would enable the reduction of GHG emissions at the least cost, both at the level of entity, as well as the overall sector and drive faster adoption of clean technologies, in a growing economy like India.",

There are already a lot of imports of aluminium and copper. Now we don't need to import. The circulation of economy is important.\u201dHe added that aluminium, copper, steel, rubber, and plastic can be recycled to reduce the cost of automobile components by 20-25%.It is estimated that India imports metals worth roughly $ 34.7 billion annually. China, South Korea, Japan, United Arab Emirates, and United States are the top five sources of metals imports into India.During his speech, Gadkari reiterated that the logistic cost in India is around 14-16% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \u201cBy new roads and changes in fuel, our target is to reduce it to 9%. This will increase our exports and is an opportunity for India,\u201d he said.Reflecting on the changing global scenario, Gadkari said that businesses now prefer India for investments as compared with other countries.Gadkari said he did not want to comment on the report by Tarun Kapoor, advisor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has proposed banning diesel vehicles across large cities in the country. But he noted that there is a need to increase localisation of fuel required to run vehicles in India.",

        "articleBody": "Months after India found its first ever lithium reserve in Jammu and Kashmir, another reserve of the crucial mineral has been found in Rajasthan's Degana (Nagaur). The new lithium reserve is much bigger than the one found in Jammu and Kashmir, news wire agency IANS quoted Rajasthan government officials as saying.Lithium is a non-ferrous metal, which is used to make mobile-laptop, electric vehicle and other chargeable batteries. GSI and mining officials have claimed that the amount of Lithium present in these reserves can satisfy 80 percent of India's total demand. The discovery of these reserves may help in reducing the dependency of India on China for Lithium.India, till now, is dependent on China for Lithium. However, with the discovery of this reserve in Rajasthan, it is believed that China's monopoly will end and like the Gulf countries, the fortunes of Rajasthan will also rise, reported IANS.India is completely dependent on expensive foreign supplies for Lithium. Now GSI has found large deposits of Lithium around Degana.Lithium reserves in Rajasthan have been found in the same Renvat hill of Degana and its surrounding area, from where Tungsten mineral was once supplied to the country. During the British rule, the British had discovered Tungsten mineral in the year 1914 on the hill of Renwat in Degana.Before independence, the Tungsten produced here was used to make war material for the British Army during the First World War. After independence, it was also used in the field of making surgical instruments in energy and health sector in the country. At that time around 1500 people used to work here.In the year 1992-93, China's cheap export policy made tungsten coming out of here expensive. Eventually, the production of tungsten was stopped here. This hill, which was inhabited all the time and helped in the development of the country by supplying tungsten for years, became deserted in a single stroke.During that period, the offices, houses, gardens and even the schools built by the officials of GSI and other government agencies were turned into ruins. Now the Lithium coming out of this hill will change the fate of Rajasthan and the country, said officials.Lithium is the world's lightest metal, needed by every battery-powered deviceLithium is also the softest and lightest metal in the world. Soft enough to be cut with a vegetable knife and light enough to float when put in water. It stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy.Lithium is present in every chargeable electronic and battery-powered gadget in the house today. For this reason, there is a tremendous demand for Lithium around the world. Due to the global demand, it is also called White Gold. The global value of one ton of Lithium is around Rs 57.36 lakh.Energy transformation is taking place all over the world. Every country is moving fast from fuel energy to green energy. From air crafts, to wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles, mobiles and every small and big chargeable device in the house, the use of Lithium is increasing.According to the World Bank report, by the year 2050, the global demand for Lithium metal will increase by 500 percent. From this point of view, getting immense reserves of Lithium in Rajasthan is extremely beneficial not only for the state but also for the country's economy.The world's largest Lithium reserves of 21 million tonnes are currently in the country of Bolivia. After this, there are also large reserves in Argentina, Chile and America. Despite this, China, which has reserves of 5.1 million tonnes of Lithium, continues to have a monopoly in the global market.India also has to buy 53.76 per cent of its total Lithium imports from China. In the year 2020-21, India had imported Lithium worth more than Rs 6,000 crore and out of this Lithium worth more than Rs 3,500 crore was bought from China.In such a situation, officials believe that the Lithium deposits found in Rajasthan are so much that China's monopoly can be completely end and the country can become self-sufficient in the matter of green energy.The story of finding Lithium reserves in Rajasthan is also very interesting. On the instructions of the Central Government, the GSI survey team reached Degana to find high grade tungsten minerals. Meanwhile, the GSI survey team found the availability of Lithium reserves in this area.Answering the question of Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal in Parliament on 29 March 2023, Union Minister of Mines and Parliamentary Affairs Prahlad Joshi had told that survey is being done by GSI in Renwat hill and its surrounding area in Degana, Rajasthan for discovery of high grade quality tungsten.In the indications so far, the GSI survey team has found deposits of high quality tungsten as well as Lithium and 4 other minerals in the G2 stage survey.Officials confirmed that Lithium deposits have been found near Degana during the search for tungsten by the GSI survey team.There is a possibility of Lithium deposits in some other places including Barmer, Jaisalmer. They informed that the survey team is expediting the exploration work of Lithium. So that auction can be done for mining by exploration of G2 stage here as soon as possible.(With inputs from IANS)  99384327",

The committee also suggested setting up a group of minister from energy-supplying ministries and a larger committee of secretaries with members from energy-consuming institutions to create a roadmap that can be adopted by stakeholders. The report said diesel city buses should not be added in urban areas and suggested encouraging the use of electric and natural gas transportation.",

        "articleBody": "India should ban diesel-powered four-wheelers in all cities with a million-plus population by 2027, and more than double the share of grid power in the national energy basket to 40% by 2035, the Energy Transition Advisory Committee of the petroleum ministry said in its final report.The committee recommended setting up a group of ministers from the ministries supervising energy supply, such as petroleum, coal, power and renewables, and a larger committee of secretaries that would also include members from the ministries overseeing energy consumption.  This set-up should orchestrate creation of the roadmap and help it get adopted along with the stakeholders,  the report said.The Energy Transition Advisory Committee was set up with former petroleum secretary Tarun Kapoor as its head and executives from state-run oil companies and an oil ministry official as members. After Kapoor took over as an adviser to the Prime Minister last year, former ONGC chairman Subhash Kumar led the team in completing the report and submitting it to the petroleum ministry. Howsoever hard we may wish the transition to be just and orderly, it's likely to be disruptive, and painful for those caught napping. However, those who plan and prepare will be well-placed to adapt to the changes and will be able to capitalise on the new opportunities,  Subhash Kumar told ET.The overall direction for surface transport has to be in favour of EVs, the report said.  Diesel-driven four-wheelers may be eliminated as soon as possible. Therefore, a ban on diesel-powered four-wheelers in all million-plus cities and all towns with high pollution has to be enforced in five years, i.e. by 2027,  the report said, adding that no diesel-powered city buses should be added in urban areas. 100057392From 2024, all new registrations for city delivery vehicles should be only electric so that in the next 10 years, 75% of the city delivery vehicles can be electric in all the million-plus cities, the report said.The share of railways, which is aggressively electrifying its tracks, should rise to 50% in national freight in 15 years from the current 23%, the committee said.The share of grid power in India's final energy consumption must rise to 40% from 18%, as a  wider use of electricity will translate into a shift towards greater use in transport, cooking and industrial applications , the report said. The target should be to have 25% of households using electricity for cooking by 2030, it added.LPG, the dominant cooking fuel in the country, should be blended with alternatives such as compressed biogas and hydrogen, as per the report.The committee also suggested setting up natural gas storage facilities that could meet up to two months of national consumption. India should develop its own gas price reference index on the lines of the Japan-Korea Marker, the spot LNG benchmark for North Asia, it said, arguing that it may help serve as a regional index and eventually help mitigate price volatility.",

In a tweet, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said this group will facilitate meetings to share knowledge and best practices related to reducing carbon emissions in transportation, promoting digital transformation, and implementing innovative technologies for more sustainable and efficient transport.Gadkari chaired the 10th Meeting for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Transport Ministers on Friday. He said that all the member states supported the concept of cooperation to decarbonize transport, promote digital transformation and technology innovative for achieving greater efficiency and sustainability.SCO currently comprises of India, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Friday\u2019s meeting was attended in person by representatives from the Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan, China and Pakistan participated in the meeting virtually. During his speech, Gadkari said that connectivity with SCO countries is a priority for India.Commenting on the growth of India\u2019s transport sector, he said that it is the backbone of an economy and is the key enabler for the growth of a country. \u201cIndia is the world's third-largest automotive market, after China and the USA, with the industry\u2019s size having grown to Rs 7.45 lakh crore and export contribution of Rs 3.5 lakh crore,\u201d Gadkari said.\u201cWith a rate of 9.91% of automobile growth per annum and rapid urbanization and industrialization, there is tremendous growth in the number and frequency of different transport modes and their movement,\u201d he said.Gadkari also said that India\u2019s transport sector accounts for 40% of the country's total CO2 emissions, with the transportation industry contributing 330 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents every year. \u201cWe have identified the immediate need to decarbonize the transport sector and make it sustainable. We have now adopted the policy of promoting clean, green, cost-effective and alternate fuels for transportation,\u201d he said.In line with this push, he highlighted how India took a historic jump in vehicular emission norms by implementing BS-6 Norms (Euro-6) directly from BS-4 Norms (Euro-4). \u201cApart from implementing stricter emission regulations, India is leading the automobile sector in terms of introducing technologies based on Bio-Fuels such as Bio-Ethanol, Methanol, Bio-CNG, and Bio-LNG,\u201d Gadkari said adding that the country is laying a special emphasis on the adoption of Electric Vehicles.",

        "articleBody": "The finance ministry is examining the possibility of allowing financial institutions to raise funds from blended finance instruments to invest in green climate projects, sources said. Blended finance involves leveraging of financial resources of the public sector or philanthropies to phase in private sector investment, thereby catalysing private finance in high-risk and long-gestation projects.  The use of blended finance promotes investments in new and emerging sectors and it attracts commercial capital towards projects that contribute to sustainable development, while providing financial returns to investors, the sources said, adding, it holds the potential to catalyse private finance in such projects.  It is still to be tested and therefore the ministry is looking at it from all possible angles, the sources said.  Blended finance is aligned to the Prime Minister goal to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, announced India's aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2070 at Glasgow in 2021.  Last year, the Union Cabinet approved India's updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) incorporating the Prime Minister's 'Panchamrit' strategy announced at the Glasgow conference into enhanced climate targets.  According to the updated NDC, India now stands committed to reducing emissions intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, from 2005 level, and achieving about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.  NDCs means national plans and pledges made by a country to meet the goal of maintaining global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while aiming for 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.  Sources said, the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Reserve Bank of India are engaging with the International Sustainability and Standards Board (ISSB) for standards to be issued on sustainable finance and climate finance.  There is a need for engagement with the standard setting body so that obligation should not be too harsh and unviable for Indian companies, sources said, adding, it should not be tilted towards developed countries and emerging economies are unable to follow it.  ISSB is supposed to announce standards for sustainable finance and climate finance in the next couple of months, sources said.",

        "articleBody": "Growing carbon footprint of industries has put sectors such as power and steel in the spotlight as major contributors to the climate crisis. The challenge of climate change can be tackled only by making our industries and businesses follow practices and processes that reduce their carbon footprint. That's possible only with heavy investment that aids such a transition, and the solution lies in green financing. What is green finance?Green financing is to increase the level of financial flows (from banking, micro-credit, insurance and investment) from the public, private and not-for-profit sectors to sustainable development priorities, as per the United Nations Environment Programme. A key part of this is to better manage environmental and social risks, take up opportunities that bring both a decent rate of return and environmental benefit and deliver greater accountability.Green financing could be promoted through changes in countries\u2019 regulatory frameworks, harmonizing public financial incentives, increases in green financing from different sectors, alignment of public sector financing decision-making with the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, increases in investment in clean and green technologies, financing for sustainable natural resource-based green economies and climate smart blue economy, increase use of green bonds, and so on.Why we need green financeIndia has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (a climate action plan to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts), aiming to reduce the country's carbon intensity by more than 45% by 2030 from its 2005 levels. As per estimates by the International Finance Corporation, India will need around $403 billion in renewable finance by 2030 to achieve its renewable targets.India's sovereign green bondsAt initial stages, green finance needs a big push by governments. The Indian government has identified projects worth \u20b925,000 crore that will be financed by proceeds from sovereign green bonds issued in the current fiscal and the next as part of its green-funding push. The projects already identified for green financing are largely in renewable energy and clean transportation segments.The government had announced plans to raise \u20b916,000 crore through green bonds in two equal tranches in the current fiscal, and the first tranche - the country's first issuance of sovereign green bonds - in January drew a robust response, with orders exceeding the offer size of \u20b98,000 crore by more than four times.Credit rating agency Fitch had said that the inaugural sovereign green bonds issued by India reflected the growing policy focus to scale up domestic financing capacity on climate mitigation and adaptationAccording to the framework approved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the sovereign green bonds will focus on financing public projects across nine areas including renewable energy, climate change, clean transportation, sustainable water and waste management, and pollution control. A green finance working panel, headed by chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, has been mandated to select projects from the proposals submitted by various government departments.Global green finance has also started chasing Indian companies, ET reported last month. Global development finance institutions and funds are ready to offer long-term support in the form of equity and debt at cheap rates to projects like solar energy and hydro power that help reduce the carbon footprint. In one of the recent deals, World Bank member International Finance Corporation (IFC) last week announced an about $50 million investment in a sustainability linked bond issued by Tata Cleantech Capital, which finances renewable energy projects.Risks in green financeAs green finance is a new practice, it comes with risks too which need effective regulation of this sector.Checking possible misuse of green finance is critical, Rajesh Gupta, managing partner at SNG Partners, a law firm specialising in green finance, told ET last month.  Checks and balances are required at an early stage to ensure compliance and avoid hoodwinking by any unscrupulous group,  he said.  Self-awareness on good governance and the intangible benefits on reputation and goodwill is a compelling reason for corporate India to become more and more ESG (environmental, social and governance standards) compliant. On March 8, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank would soon issue guidelines for regulated entities to increase green lending, accept green deposits and mitigate risks related to climate change.How businesses can benefit from green financeBusinesses that take to green finance can benefit in various ways. It can help them follow different environmental norms and regulations and thus avoid possible fines. Since climate change has gained huge public attention, adopting sustainable practices by relying on green finance enhances brand value and offers a positive differentiator. Customers tend to prefer brands that adopt clear sustainable practices. The energy-efficient and other sustainable practices promoted by green finance also often help in saving costs thus boosting profitability of businesses.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The NITI Aayog plans to review India's strong push to electric vehicles (EVs) running on lithium-ion batteries since about 75% of the lithium-ion imports come from China.A section within the government feels that India should not rely heavily on China for lithium-ion and instead explore other green sources to power its future vehicles, said a senior official. Internal deliberations are on and the plan is to assess India's dependence on China for this critical component of EVs and its long-term implications on the economy,  said the official, who did not wish to be identified.The discussions assume significance in the wake of China considering prohibiting exports of certain rare-earth elements and high performance magnets which are used in EV motors. The move could lead to China's monopoly in EV motor manufacturing.99540368India has seen a significant surge in volume and value of lithium-ion imports, buoyed by increasing demand for EVs.India's total lithium-ion imports surged to $2.31 billion in April 2022-January 2023 from $1.83 billion in the entire 2021-22. About 75% or $1.75 billion of these imports in the first ten months of 2022-23 were from China, followed by 10% or $248 million from Hong Kong, 9.3% or $216 million from South Korea and miniscule quantities from Vietnam and Singapore. In all likelihood, the imports from Vietnam and Singapore are actually being rerouted from China. Though we now notionally have lithium reserves, the high dependence on China puts industry at risk,  an auto component industry executive said on condition of anonymity.According to a recent report by the Global Trade Research Initiative, EV manufacturing in India will increase the country's dependence on China for raw materials, mineral processing and battery production, suggesting that there is a need for life cycle impact evaluation of the EV sector on jobs, pollution levels, imports and economic growth.The report also highlighted that China has bought the largest lithium mines in Australia and South America, and it processes more than 60% of the lithium produced globally, besides 65% of cobalt and 93% of manganese.While the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research is carrying out lithium exploration in Karnataka and the Geological Survey of India has undertaken exploration of various minerals, including lithium, experts said these are long gestation projects which will take several years before India becomes self-reliant in lithium-ion production to power its batteries.India has also put in place a Rs 18,100 crore production-linked incentive scheme to manufacture advanced chemistry cells in the country in the next five years to become self-reliant and avoid any supply shocks in future.",

While members recognised the need to reduce gas consumption, however, they also said investment in the sector can help address potential energy shortfalls, the communique showed. Ministers from the G7 group of advanced democracies are gathering in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo for two days of meetings on climate, energy and environmental policy. The issues of renewable sources of fuel and energy security have taken on new urgency following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Host country Japan, which is dependent on imports for nearly all its energy needs, wants to keep liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transition fuel for at least 10 to 15 years.  We will drastically increase electricity generated by renewable energies,  the members said in the communique, pledging to collectively increase offshore wind capacity by 150 gigawatts by 2030 and solar capacity to more than 1 terawatt. The members also agreed to accelerate  the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels  - the burning of fossil fuels without using technology to capture the resulting C02 emissions - to achieve net zero in energy systems by 2050 at the latest.",

The government has decided to invite bids for 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for the next five years i.e., from Financial Year 2023-24 till Financial Year 2027-28, a Ministry of New and Renewable Energy statement said. These annual bids of ISTS (Inter-State Transmission) connected renewable energy capacity will also include setting up of wind power capacity of at least 10 GW per annum, it stated. The plan finalised by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) at a meeting chaired by Union Minister for Power & New and Renewable Energy R K Singh last week, is in accordance with the Prime Minister's announcement at COP26, of achieving 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel (Renewable Energy + Nuclear) sources by 2030.  India currently has a total renewable energy capacity of 168.96 GW (as of 28th February 2023) with about 82 GW at various stages of implementation and about 41 GW under tendering stage.  This includes 64.38 GW of Solar Power, 51.79 GW of Hydro Power, 42.02 GW of Wind Power and 10.77 GW of BioPower.  Considering the fact that Renewable Energy (RE) projects take around 18-24 months for commissioning, the bid plan will add 250 GW of renewable energy and ensure 500 GW of installed capacity by 2030. The Ministry of Power is already working on upgrading and adding the transmission system capacity for evacuating 500 GW of electricity from non-fossil fuel, it stated.  Speaking during the meeting, Singh had said that the declaration of trajectory of short-term and long-term RE capacity addition by the Government is a significant step towards achieving the goal of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and towards a faster energy transition.   India has emerged as one of the world leaders in Energy Transition and this is evident in the growth that we have achieved in the area of Renewable Energy. We are committed to achieving 500 GW of Target by 2030 and the bidding trajectory will provide further stimulus towards this.  The structured bidding trajectory will provide sufficient time to the RE developers to plan their finances, develop their business plans and manage the supply chain more efficiently This is a golden opportunity of industry to invest in this sector,  Singh said.  New & Renewable Energy Secretary B S Bhalla said in the statement that the bidding trajectory will also enable the power procurers, including the distribution companies, to manage their RE procurement plans effectively.   The bid trajectory will also provide a fillip to the RE manufacturing industry in the country by indicating the demand that would be created for their equipment,  he added.  In addition to this, the ministry has declared a quarterly plan of the bids for FY 2023-24, which comprises bids for at least 15 GW of renewable energy capacity in each of the first and second quarters of the financial year (April-June 2023 and July-September 2023 respectively), and at least 10 GW in each of the third and fourth quarters of the financial year (Oct-December 2023 and January-March 2024 respectively).  This capacity addition is over and above the RE capacities that would come up under schemes like Rooftop solar and PM-KUSUM of the Ministry, under which, bids issued directly by various States & also capacities that may come up under Open Access Rules.  Presently, Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd. (SECI), NTPC Ltd. and NHPC Ltd., are notified by the Government as Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies (REIAs) for calling such bids. It has been decided to also notify SJVN Ltd, a public sector enterprise under the Government of India, as a REIA.  The targeted bid capacity for FY 2023-24 would be allocated among the four REIAs.  The REIAs would be permitted to bring out the bids for solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid, RTC RE power, etc. - all with/without storage, as per their assessment of the RE market or as per directions of the Government.",

        "articleBody": "India needs an investment worth USD 540 billion by 2029 to meet its ambitious targets for electricity generation from renewable sources, said S&P Global Ratings said on Thursday as it saw private-sector-led energy transition entering a new phase. The government has been targeting to cut emissions in India to net zero by 2070. In the transition to that, it is targeting 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil electricity capacity, half of the energy from renewables, a reduction of emissions by one billion tonne and an emissions intensity of the GDP by 45 per cent by 2030.  Meeting India's renewables target of 500 GW by 2030 requires more than 40 GW of new capacity additions annually (compared to 10-15 GW actual),  PTI quoted the report as saying. In its report 'Asia-Pacific's Different Pathways To Energy Transition', S&P Global Ratings said the addition of renewables capacity in India is outpacing coal, but demand growth and intermittency issues are leading to greater coal usage and new coal plants.  Policies are creating an enabling environment while private sector investments will lead the energy transition,  it said, adding investments of USD 540 billion are required from 2020 to 2029 to meet India's renewables target. Half of these investments will be in renewables and batteries, and another third in strengthening the grid.  Private sector will lead generation capex while public sector utilities will likely lead grid investments,  it said.  Domestic long-term bank funding is available against projects and cash flows.  There is, however, limited appetite for unsecured holding company funding. India is the world's fourth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the US and the EU. But its emissions per capita are much lower than other major world economies. India emitted 1.9 tonnes of CO2 per head of population in 2019, compared to 15.5 tonne for the US and 12.5 tonne for Russia that year. Net zero, or becoming carbon neutral, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Energy transition refers to the shift from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption - including oil, natural gas and coal - to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, as well as lithium-ion batteries. S&P said renewables face increasing intermittency issues, necessitating grid flexibility/energy storage solutions. As much as 12.1 GW of energy storage is likely to be added from now till 2030 against a target of 27 GW of battery and 10 GW of pumped storage by 2030, it said, adding 20 per cent tariff on Chinese batteries and subsidies for domestic production aim to develop the ecosystem. In the report, S&P said the countries of Asia-Pacific still have a long way to go before they can meet their ambitious energy targets.  Policies are still evolving and some key countries such as China and India have no specific timeline to phase out coal,  said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Abhishek Dangra.  Access and affordability will trump long-term energy-transition goals while energy security considerations may delay transition for some.  India's transition is progressing, led by the private sector.  India is entering into the next stage -- Renewables 3.0 -- with industry diversification into hybrid, pumped storage, round-the-clock projects, etc. It is moving away from feed-in-tariff (1.0) and highly competitive bidding (2.0). Execution risks and return profiles can significantly diverge,  Dangra said. Energy security considerations will affect the policy direction and pace of the energy transition; not always delaying the transition.  Economics (India) and policies (China) will lead to growth in renewables. Countries with ambiguous policies (Vietnam) or cheaper fossil fuels (Indonesia) face a more difficult transition,  it said.(With inputs from PTI)",

        "articleBody": "If India stopped burning coal tomorrow, over five million people would lose their jobs. But for a price tag of around $900 billion over the next 30 years, the country can make sure nobody is left behind in the huge move to clean energy to curb human-caused climate change, according to figures released by New Delhi-based think tank Thursday.The International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, known by the acronym iFOREST, released two reports detailing how much it will cost for India to move away from coal and other dirty fuels without jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions who still are employed in coal mines and thermal power plants.Ensuring that everyone can come along in the clean energy shift that's needed to stop the worst harms of climate change and guaranteeing new work opportunities for those in fossil fuel industries, known as a just transition, has been a major consideration for climate and energy analysts.\u201cJust transition should be viewed as an opportunity for India to support green growth in the country\u2019s fossil fuel dependent states and districts,\u201d said iFOREST head Chandra Bhushan.To get the $900 billion figure, the group researched four coal districts in India and identified eight different cost factors, like setting up infrastructure and getting workers ready for the transition.The biggest single investment to enable a just transition will be the cost of setting up clean energy infrastructure, which the report estimates could be up to $472 billion by 2050. Providing workers with clean energy jobs will cost less than 10% of the total amount required for a just transition, or about $9 billion.The think tank said $600 billion would come as investments in new industries and infrastructure, with an additional $300 billion as grants and subsidies to support coal industry workers and affected communities.\u201cThe scale of transition is massive. If formal and informal sector workers are included, we are talking about an industry that is the lifeline for 15 to 20 million people,\u201d said Sandeep Pai, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C. based think tank. \u201cReports like this are extremely important since the just transition conversation is beginning only now in India ... we need much more.\u201dIndia is one of the largest emitters of planet-warming gases behind only China, the U.S. and the EU. The country depends on coal for 75% of its electricity needs and for 55% of its overall energy needs and is still a far way off quitting.Earlier this month, the Indian government issued emergency orders stipulating that coal plants are run at full capacity through this summer to avoid any power outages. The country\u2019s coal use is expected to peak between 2035 and 2040, according to government figures.Prime minister Narendra Modi announced in 2021 that the country will achieve net zero emissions \u2014 where it only puts out greenhouse gases that it can somehow offset \u2014 by 2070. On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urged nations to speed up their net zero goals, calling for developing countries to set a target of 2050. He was met with a muted response.The reports recommends that the Indian government focuses on retiring old and unprofitable mines and power plants first. Over 200 of India's more than 459 mines can be retired in this way.\u201cThe energy transition has to start with coal,  said Jayant Sinha, who represents the coal-rich Hazaribagh constituency in the central Indian state of Jharkhand, adding that the switch to clean energy needs both funds and institutions to ramp it up.  Both of this must happen together for a successful transition,\u201d he said.Partnerships with developed countries to help the coal-reliant nations of South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam make a just energy transition have been made in recent years. While these deals are steps in the right direction, they're too small in scale to make a real impact, energy experts say.It's still not clear if India will be open to a similar just energy transition deal.Indian leaders have expressed skepticism over climate funds promised by developed nations, pointing to a promise to give low-income and developing countries $100 billion every year to help with climate challenges back in 2009 that still hasn't been met.",

        "articleBody": "The Delhi government's solar policy, which will be notified next month, aims to meet 25 per cent of the city's annual electricity demand through the clean energy by 2025, Delhi Finance Minister Kailash Gahlot announced on Wednesday. While presenting his maiden budget as finance minister, Gahlot in the assembly announced an allocation of Rs 3,348 crore for the power sector, up from Rs 3,340 crore last year, and highlighted that electricity rates have not been increased in the last eight years.  The Delhi government has treated providing minimum electricity to every household in Delhi like a fundamental right and in the year 2022-23, out of Delhi's 58.5 lakh domestic consumers, about 84 per cent had availed the Delhi government's electricity subsidy scheme,  he said in the assembly. Gahlot said the government's Solar Policy will be notified by next month and it will establish Delhi as a leading example for the country in the field of solar energy.  The Delhi Solar Policy 2022 aims to meet 25 per cent of Delhi's annual electricity demand through solar energy by 2025, which currently stands at nine per cent,  the minister said.  To achieve this, the policy has set a target of installing solar infrastructure with a capacity of 6,000 MW by 2025, which will include 750 MW of 'Roof Top Solar' (RTS),  he said. The policy also aims to generate around 12,000 green jobs in the national capital, Gahlot said. Claiming that the Delhi government has come forward as an example for the world by setting up EV (electric vehicle) charging stations with the lowest charging tariffs, he said 30 charging stations will be launched this month.  The minimum cost for EV charging is only Rs 3 per kWh, which is the lowest EV charging tariff. First 11 of 100 EV charging stations were inaugurated on October 18, 2022. Another 30 charging stations will be launched in March 2023 and the rest in the next financial year,  Gahlot said. Nearly 900 EV charging points and 103 battery swapping points will come up in the city, he said. In 2021-22, 84 per cent of the 58.5 lakh domestic consumers in the city availed the Delhi government's electricity subsidy scheme, the finance minister said and added that Delhi successfully met its peak power demand of 7,695 MW units on June 29 last year with zero load-shedding.  The aggregate technical and commercial losses of Delhi is now the lowest in the whole country at less than eight per cent,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "India, the world's fifth largest economy, can achieve energy independence through clean technology by 2047, a report by a top US research institute said, highlighting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Atmanirbhar Bharat push that spans from a massive renewable capacity addition to electric mobility, saving billions of dollars in imports. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a US' federally funded research and development centre, along with The India Energy and Climate Center (IECC) located at UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy published a report, 'Pathways to Atmanirbhar Bharat', that highlights the steps taken by India towards the adoption of clean energy.  India is 80-85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil and coal needs. The price and supply volatility in global energy markets, as witnessed in recent years, strain India's foreign exchange reserves, resulting in economy-wide inflation.  However, recent dramatic declines in clean energy costs provide India an opportunity to lower energy imports through investment in renewable energy, battery storage, EVs, and green hydrogen, the report said.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already set a target to install 500 GW (gigawatt) of renewable energy capacity by 2030. The government intends to grow EV sales in India to capture the markets of 30 per cent of private cars, 70 per cent of commercial vehicles and 80 per cent of two- and three-wheelers by 2030. Also, it is targeting production of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by splitting water using electricity from renewable sources.  Abundant solar energy and local technology will aid this and also reduce carbon emissions. All this towards a Atmanirbhar Bharat or a self-reliant India that does have to depend on imports for meeting its energy needs.  Energy independence, the report said, involves investment in renewables, electric vehicles, and green hydrogen -- generating electricity from solar and wind energy -- and will help move away from coal-based generation while use of electricity-charged batteries till cutting dependence on liquid fuel like petrol and diesel. Zero-carbon hydrogen will decarbonise Indian industry, cutting emissions and lowering dependence on imported fuel.   This would involve installing more than 500 GW of non-fossil electricity generation capacity by 2030, an 80 per cent clean grid by 2040 and 90 per cent by 2047,  it said.  Nearly 100 per cent of new vehicle sales could be electric by 2035. Heavy industrial production shifts primarily to green hydrogen and electrification: 90 per cent of iron and steel, 90 per cent of cement, and 100 per cent of fertilizers by 2047.   And this could help  India achieve energy independence through clean technology by 2047,  the report said.  The transition to electric vehicles could save crude oil imports by over 90 per cent (or USD 240 billion) by 2047, while green hydrogen based and electrified industrial production would reduce industrial coal imports by 95 per cent. Lithium needed for manufacturing new electric vehicles and grid-scale battery storage systems (around 2 million tonnes cumulative between 2023 and 2040) could be produced domestically using newly discovered reserves.   Energy independence is economically advantageous,  it said.  Clean energy will reduce and inflation proof India's energy expenditure as renewables, EV batteries, and hydrogen infrastructure are capital assets with rapidly falling costs. A shift to electric transportation will create USD 2.5 trillion in net consumer savings by 2047.   Indian industry, to remain globally competitive, must also transition to clean technologies like green steel manufacturing, as major export markets (ex. EU) make carbon neutrality commitments, the report said, adding the clean energy transition would have minimal impacts on tax revenues.  Fossil fuel taxes, duties, and royalties contribute about 12 per cent of state and central government revenue.  Despite an aggressive clean energy transition, fossil fuel consumption and associated tax revenues will not drop below 2020 levels until the mid-2030s, it said.  The study said a rapid expansion of clean energy infrastructure will be needed.  Because of transport, industrial electrification and green hydrogen production, electricity demand could increase nearly five-fold - from 1,300 TWh/year to over 6,600 TWh/year by 2050. This would require a massive scale-up of renewable energy deployment to 40 GW a year through 2030, ramping up to about 100 GW a year between 2030 and 2050.   Clean energy deployment will be more capital-intensive, needing a net additional investment of USD 1.5-2 trillion between 2023-2047, compared with business-as-usual.   Achieving energy independence could offer environmental and public health benefits without compromising economic growth. With an aggressive clean energy transition, over 4 million air pollution-related premature deaths could be avoided between 2023-2047. India's CO2 emissions will peak in the early 2030s, before dropping to 800 million tonnes per year by 2047 (85-90 per cent of the way to net-zero emissions).   Managing the clean energy transition would require significant policy support. The policy ecosystem needs to have five pillars: deployment mandates for commercial / cost-effective clean technologies that provide the economies of scale, financial support for emerging technologies, long-term infrastructure planning, accelerating/scaling domestic manufacturing, and planning for a just transition,  it added.",

        "articleBody": "The Tamil Nadu government on Saturday unveiled its 'TN Ethanol Blending Policy 2023,' with a mission to improve farmer income, revive the sugar industry and to attract investments worth Rs 5000 crore in molasses/grain based Ethanol production capacity. The targets for the policy term are  to be self-sufficient and meet the estimated Ethanol blending requirement of 130 crore litres. To attract investments worth Rs 5,000 crore in molasses/grain-based Ethanol production capacity in the State.  The policy seeks to support indigenous production of fuel grade ethanol under the EBP programme.  Given the fluctuations in crude oil prices, it is prudent for pioneer States like Tamil Nadu to augment biofuel production within the State using indigenous sources which could partly insulate the import price shocks, address the pollution concerns and enhance agricultural output and its utilisation.  The vision of the policy, released by Chief Minister M K Stalin in the Secretariat, is promotion of Tamil Nadu as a green economy and investment hub for alternate cost-effective green fuel. Improving farmer income through price realisation and expansion in opportunities due to ethanol blending, reviving sugar industry in Tamil Nadu through improved utilisation of existing mills and diversification to dual feedstock forms part of the Mission statement. New grain-based distilleries or expansion of existing grain-based distilleries, new molasses and sugar/sugar syrup-based distilleries or expansion of existing distilleries, whether attached to sugar mills or standalone distilleries are covered under the scope of the policy, which is valid for 5 years from the date of notification. Augmenting indigenous bioethanol production capacity from agri-resources to encourage revival of the sugar industry and diversification to other food grains is among factors for encouraging EBP.  Simplifying/streamlining regulatory challenges by creation of institutional mechanism to support investors with faster clearances and facilitate assured procurement,  is one of the other key aspect outlined. Ethanol is an agro-based product, mainly produced from a by-product of the sugar industry, namely molasses. The Centre's Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme (EBP Programme) seeks to achieve blending of Ethanol with motor spirit with a view to reducing pollution, conserve foreign exchange and increase value addition in the sugar industry enabling them to clear cane price arrears of farmers.",

        "articleBody": "Countries are free to chart out their own unique low-carbon pathways based on national priorities and resources as a one-size-fits-all approach won't work, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) said in a joint statement on Tuesday.Petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Puri represented India at a virtual meeting on emerging fuels and energy modelling.  There does not exist one uniform low-carbon pathway working equally well for all the countries, and each country is free to chart out its own unique path based on national priorities and resources,  the SCO said. There has been a push by the richer world to bring down the global use of coal. But a forced reduction in coal consumption can increase the energy security risk for countries endowed with coal as they would then depend more on imports of other fuels to meet their energy needs.Puri said every member state is concerned about energy affordability, although some bigger countries have a greater ability to deal with price increases than others. Oil and gas prices surged in the past year, forcing each country to figure out its own mechanism to deal with the volatility. You can't sit in India and determine what the global prices would be. I mean, that is determined by OPEC, by how much supplies they decide to release,  said Puri. The SCO comprises eight member states - India, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.OPEC+, the producer club led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has kept a curb on supplies, contributing to higher global oil prices in the past year.\u2003",

        "articleBody": "India is likely to discontinue the second phase of the \u20b910,000 crore Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India or FAME II scheme after the next financial year, government officials familiar with deliberations said. The Centre could instead offer incentives to EV makers through ongoing production linked incentive (PLI) programmes to support the sector, they said.Industry has approached the government for extending the FAME II scheme beyond FY24. The likely shift comes as the ministry of heavy industries, which administers FAME, has launched an investigation into the alleged misappropriation of subsidies under the scheme by two-wheeler EV makers, said the people cited above. It has halted the release of subsidies in some cases. Under FAME, companies can offer a discount of up to 40% on the cost of locally manufactured vehicles and claim it as subsidy from the government. The investigations are focused on the claimed local content. We are unlikely to extend the scheme beyond FY24,  a senior government official said, adding that key FAME II goals will be achieved by then. FAME II aims to support 1 million EV two-wheelers (E2W) and 7,000 electric buses (e-buses). About 800,000 E2Ws and 3,500 e-buses are likely to be on the road by the end of March this year.  The balance E2W and e-buses goals will be comfortably achieved by the end of 2023-24,  the official told ET. However, FAME II targets for electric three- and four-wheelers are unlikely to be attained, he said. The Centre's focus is not on personal mobility through electric four-wheelers but on public transport buses and cheaper E2Ws for masses. The three-wheeler market is already growing at present price points,  he said.Under the PLI scheme, benefits will be accrued at the manufacturers' end. This will be through PLI programmes covering advanced chemistry cell (ACC) battery storage, automobiles, and auto components, the official said. In FAME II, the subsidy is disbursed at the point of sale of the vehicles. The PLI support for ACC, automobile, and auto component industry will start getting disbursed from FY24 and gain momentum in subsequent years. These will make manufacturing costs of all vehicles, including EVs, cheaper in the country,  the official said.The Centre has earmarked Rs 25,938 crore under the PLI programme for automobiles and auto components. As many as 115 companies have filed applications under this segment of the PLI scheme, which was notified in September 2021.Out of these, five auto original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) had applied for both parts of the scheme. In all, the PLI programme has been successful in attracting proposed investments in manufacturing automobiles and components of Rs 74,850 crore, of which Rs 45,016 crore is from approved applicants under the Champion OEM Incentive Scheme.For batteries, the Centre has allocated Rs 18,100 crore. The goal of this programme is to establish a manufacturing capacity of 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of advanced chemistry cells (ACCs) for enhancing India's manufacturing capabilities. 98463499",

        "articleBody": "Greenko Energy Holdings, one of the largest clean energy companies in the country, is set to prepay a tranche of $500 million of its dollar bonds that would mature in August this year using its near-term cash flows, people familiar with the matter told ET. The company clocked $625 million in Ebitda (operating profit) in FY22 and is expected to close fiscal year 2023 at $650 million on revenues of $720 million.These papers, linked to a  restricted group  of 500MW of renewable assets and issued in 2015, are among the first high-yield bond instruments from India.This development comes just days after it fully redeemed the entire outstanding $435 million bonds, due for maturity in March, having refinanced them through a bridge loan from global banks JP Morgan, Barclays, DBS Bank, among others, amid hardening rates, ET reported on February 22. It paid investors in full their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest.These two developments will help the company extinguish $1 billion of its outstanding bonds.Greenko declined to comment. 98256267The Hyderabad-based company is among the largest issuer of green bonds at $4 billion, backed by GIC of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Orix Corporation of Japan .Greenko's current operating portfolio is 7.3GW from 114 projects spread across 15 states. Bond markets have been the worst affected in 2022, both on the supply and yield sides,  said the CFO of a renewable company who did not wish to be quoted.  If Indian corporates start pre-paying, then 2023 will hopefully restore the confidence of the bond markets toward energy transition stories from emerging markets like India. In the past, Indian state-owned or private banks were aggressive in the project finance market but in the last few years, it has largely been funded by the global bond markets. But with several renewable companies missing their financial targets, the market sentiments have been weak and that, in turn, has seen muted capacity. Over the years from being a pure-play utility player, Greenko has pivoted toward offering energy as a service, with storage solutions, pumped hydro helping in industrial decarbonisation. Greenko has now moved to green hydrogen and ammonia and then speciality complex chemicals.Last month, the company said it would be investing \u20b910,000 crore to set up a pumped storage project (PSP) near Gandhi Sagar in Neemuch District of Madhya Pradesh. In 2022, it partnered with Singapore-based Keppel Infrastructure Holdings (Keppel Infrastructure) to jointly produce at least 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year. In September, Korean steelmaker Posco Holdings partnered with Greenko subsidiary ZeroC for producing green hydrogen, ammonia and related derivatives in India for both the domestic and export markets.

        "articleBody": "Chennai: The mining and supply of domestic lithium to Indian electric vehicle (EV) makers will result in reduction in production cost of lithium cells and in end vehicle production cost, said Anirudh Ravi Narayanan, CEO & Co-Founder, Bharat New-Energy.Queried about the impact of domestic supplies of lithium on the production cost of EVs, Narayanan in an interview told IANS:  My expectation is that we can see cell prices 20-30 per cent due to these, which would lead to vehicle cost reduction of 8-15 per cent.  I am not an expert on the mining industry, but from what I understand it will take 3 years minimum for us to see output,  he added.Here are excerpts from the interview:On the lithium reserves found in India.It is great news for our country. However, there's more work to be done. The reserves are in G3 stage and further exploration will be needed to qualify the find with a high-level of confidence.What does the finding of lithium reserves mean for the EV industry players? Will it result in reduction in vehicle prices?Definitely it will be good for the industry to have local cell manufacturing and local supply chain feeding the cell manufacturing. Both of these will result in reduction in cost of the Li-Ion batteries. My expectation is that we can see cell prices 20-30 per cent due to these, which would lead to vehicle cost reduction of 8-15 per cent.With domestic supplies of lithium will EV players will go for backward integration? What are your views for your group on this point?It makes sense for EV players to backward integrate up to cell manufacturing, but not necessarily up to mining. Mining is best left to people who know the industry.On the view that India should skip the lithium battery and go the next step? If yes, why and if no, why?At scale, my belief is that today there is no better option than lithium batteries. While there is talk of other battery technologies (like sodium ion, metal air), and fuel cell technologies, all these are not yet proven at scale -- whereas lithium is. We cannot afford to wait for these technologies to mature -- in the meantime we must progress towards clean energy.One more way to think about it is that since lithium batteries can generate more immediate returns as against new technologies that may involve years of R&D, the returns from our investments in lithium today can help fund our R&D into new generation energy technologies.Finally, while these other technologies are still evolving, lithium batteries are getting better day-by-day. By the time these technologies mature for scale production, it's possible lithium batteries will remain a better option in terms of scalability, cost, safety, performance, etc. In conclusion -- we should not skip investing in lithium batteries.On the value and volume of lithium battery/cell being imported by India.As of FY '22, India imported $1.8 billion of lithium batteries and cells. As for FY'23, up until Q3'23, we had already exceeded this number so we may end the year with about $2.4 billion worth of imports.If lithium is mined and made available in the country, will there be any reduction in the global prices? If yes, to what extent? What is the current rate?There should definitely be a reduction in domestic prices. Global prices are harder to predict since it will depend on the global supply/demand scenario. In domestic, as mentioned I would expect a 20-30 per cent reduction in cell prices. Today cell prices in rupee terms can vary from Rs 9,000 to Rs 20,000 per kWh for NMC and LFP cells depending on the quality.Will the domestic lithium source result in the growth of battery making units in India?Yes certainly. As the domestic EV industry grows (and with the government push to only buy domestic batteries), battery making units in the country will certainly grow. But once the local cell manufacturing at scale and local mining and refinement capacities are established, I predict India can become a strong exporter of lithium batteries.",

        "articleBody": "India is unlikely to sign a deal with richer nations this year for a just energy transition, as international funding rests on India committing to a timeline to phase out coal, an  unviable  proposition for the country, energy analysts said. The Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations, together with Norway, Denmark and the European Union, believe a 'just energy transition partnership' (JETP) with India will financially empower it to reduce climate changing emissions from power production. Similar pacts have been signed with South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, but India wants a JETP on its own terms: no phase out of coal and funds for clean energy expansion in the form of grants, not loans.  The developed world is pushing for a JETP as they want coal out. The JETPs with South Africa and Indonesia are all about coal. But that won't work here,  said economist Vaibhav Chaturvedi, a fellow at the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).  Coal is the only stable source of energy in India, which is still a developing economy. India won't talk about coal but (instead about) more renewable energy, which has more achievable and demonstrable targets,  Chaturvedi said in an interview. India's ministry of external affairs, which is considering JETP proposals this year as India helms the G20 presidency, did not respond to queries despite repeated emails and phone calls. But analysts familiar with India's stance said conversation around a JETP is stuck on the financial terms of funding and India's resistance to being  bullied into a partnership . What India needs is more green jobs and funds to train people for them, said Swati Dsouza, an energy analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.  The JETP as it currently stands may not be the best model or framework for India given that the country will see an increase in energy demand and possible increase in coal capacity,  she said. MIXED SIGNALSIn recent months, India has relaxed environmental and public consultations on coal mine expansions, boosted its coal production and cited coal as critical for energy security in global climate dialogues. But the country still aims to reduce coal from 50% of its energy mix currently to about 30% by 2030, while building 500 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable capacity. Simultaneously beefing up both coal and renewables points to a messy energy transition for India, including the risk of job losses if some coal mines are abandoned. India's mixed signals, analysts say, indicate the country will phase out coal only when it is sure the transition won't cause power disruptions, with renewable energy storage capacity currently still weak and expensive. As the world's third largest power consumer, India's power use has doubled since the turn of the century, with over 900 million citizens gaining an electrical connection in less than two decades, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Last year, the country faced one of its worst power crises in six years as a heatwave swept across the nation, pushing up energy demand, triggering power cuts, causing a fuel crisis at overworked power plants and boosting heat-related deaths. As it tries to meet rising demand for power, coal use will peak in India between 2030 and 2035, the government said - but meantime the country needs to strengthen its renewable grid and infrastructure, for which it wants JETP funding.  We still want to negotiate with developed countries ... as long as developed countries listen to us,  said Santosh Patnaik, program coordinator at Climate Action Network South Asia. ENERGY ASPIRATIONSThe village of Bhadla, in a desert region in northwestern Rajasthan state, got its first power grid connection five years ago. While electricity arrives less than eight hours each day, it has lit up evenings in a village that earlier used kerosene lamps to help its sheep-herding children study at night.  All we want is a steady power supply,  said Sadar Khan, the village council head who has written to authorities lamenting power cuts that can last in some cases a whole day. A JETP that focuses only on reducing coal would be looking at India's energy transition too  narrowly , glossing over the growing aspirations of Indians, analysts say. Many are new consumers of electricity and need affordable power to improve their economic condition, they said. Households with new electricity connections, many of them in rural areas, are now using washing machines, refrigerators and laptops, said Gauri Singh, deputy director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). India's transition efforts need to be mindful of these aspirations, she said, adding the country's challenge was to ensure clean and affordable energy for all while moving away from fossil fuel.  The JETP cannot be a broad-brushed partnership but has to look at the context of each country. It is much more complex than retiring thermal plants,  Singh said in a video call. BIG MONEYLast December, the G7 nations announced $15.5 billion for Vietnam to help it transition away from coal, with only a minor part as grants and most of the money as loans. India could land a much larger deal, with the United States and Germany at the forefront of negotiations with the South Asian powerhouse, analysts say. India may be able to use its position as G20 leader this year to steer discussions on a deal toward scaling renewable capacity and investments in new technologies, said R.R. Rashmi, programme director for earth science and climate change at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). To meet its target of having 500GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, India will have to invest an average of $27.9 billion annually up to 2029, research estimates show - but its budget allocations aren't sufficient for that, economists said. Beyond scaling up renewables, India also needs to acknowlege that energy shifts now underway will require a just transition for workers.  This is not the question of our energy sector being decarbonised but also about exit, compensation of coal workers and alternate livelihoods,  Rashmi from TERI said.  Even if we cannot cut down on coal, we have to prepare for a phase down,  he said. THE EXCLUDEDAt least five Indian states - some of them the country's poorest - depend heavily on the country's coal economy. In the absence of a uniform just transition plan for the country, they risk losing their main revenue source. Coal workers' unions say funding to restore land in areas ravaged by years of mining, creation of new jobs in new industries and training in the skills needed for jobs in clean energy are needed.  The just transition conversation is dominated by technical and financial issues, ignoring the social aspect of transition, which is the most important,  said D.D. Ramanandan, general secretary of the All India Coal Workers Federation.  Engineers and finance experts are discussing just transition, not us. We are the biggest stakeholders in this. If coal ends, everything ends for us, but we are sidelined. This will be an unjust transition.  ",

In India, more than 75 per cent of all female workers are employed in agriculture and agri-allied industries such as food processing and livestock.  With the help of decentralised renewable energy (DRE) technologies which are capable of mitigating intermittent electricity problems and introducing mechanisation, the rural women will be able to improve their productivity, according to the 'Unlocking Sustainable Livelihood Opportunities for Rural Women' report. The report showcases several models to mainstream women in tech-enabled livelihood opportunities using distributed renewable energy-powered technologies as a case study.   Powering Livelihoods has helped more than 13,000 end-users using programme-supported DRE livelihood technologies, out of which more than 10,400 (80 per cent) are women in increasing their income and facilitating them with the employment latitude,  reported PTI citing the report. The report captures detailed insights from more than 700 end-users, out of whom 70 per cent of women experienced a 33 per cent increase in income on average, and 92 per cent of women said that their business knowledge and skills have become more relevant. So far, at least 30 women have received collateral-free, low-interest financing, unlocked through the programme's effort. More financiers' commitments are underway to provide easy financing to women DRE users and women-led farmer producer organisations, the report said.  However, India's GDP has the potential to grow by 18 per cent just by providing equal work opportunities for women by 2025, but women face myriad challenges to realise their full economic potential such as lack of opportunities, and cultural barriers.(With inputs from PTI)",

        "articleBody": "Leading infrastructure investor Macquarie Group plans to sell its renewable energy platform in India, Vibrant Energy, two people aware of the development said. Investment bank JP Morgan has been hired to run the sale process, which is likely to value the assets at $500 million (\u20b94,000 crore).Vibrant Energy, which primarily sells electricity to corporate and industrial (C&I) customers, operates a renewable energy portfolio of 132MW, with an active pipeline of 3GW. The group develops open access renewable energy solutions (wind and solar) for corporate customers. About 70% stake in Vibrant Energy is owned by Blueleaf Energy, a portfolio company of Macquarie's Green Investment Group (GIG), while the rest is held by US-based ATN International. In 2020, Blueleaf Energy Asia Pte entered India by acquiring a majority stake in Vibrant Energy Holdings from ATN International (ATN).Blueleaf Energy has a development pipeline of solar, wind and storage projects in excess of 7GW globally. Macquarie's GIG has 85+ GW portfolio under development across 25 markets globally.Vibrant Energy, which delivers a mix of solar and wind energy, has major clients in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.98161681Mails sent to Macquarie and ATN International remained unanswered. In December last year, Vibrant Energy had joined hands with Amazon to set up the retail giant's wind-solar hybrid project in India. These two projects represent a total of 300MW of renewable energy capacity and will be based in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.Last year, India's leading digital ICT solutions provider Sify Technologies also signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Vibrant Energy for a total 231 MW of solar and wind energy capacity to power Sify's latest hyperscale data centers.Veh Srishti Energy (VSEPL), a part of the Vibrant Energy Group, is developing a 54-MW wind power project at Kasar, in Maharashtra, after signing a long-term PPA (20 years) under the group captive structure with Sify Infinit Spaces. The scheduled commissioning date of the project is June 2023.  Given the healthy credit risk profile of the offtaker, the counterparty risk remains low. The PPA has been signed for the entire capacity at a competitive tariff, which is at a discount to the grid tariff, thereby mitigating the offtake and price risks,  said a recent credit report by ICRA.Macquarie Asia Infrastructure Fund, a leading investor in India, had sold toll road assets in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh to Adani Road Transport (ARTL) last year, for an enterprise value of \u20b93,110 crore.According to the data released by the ministry of new and renewable energy, India's green energy capacity reached 120.85GW, till December 2022. Solar energy contributed for 52% share in the total renewable energy segment, making it the major contributor followed by wind energy with 35%, said the JMK Research report. The government had declared an ambitious target of 175 GW from renewables by 2022.",

Despite the challenges, the renewable energy outlook in Asia remains promising, with significant capital injection expected into the sector. In India also, the renewable energy (RE) sector has seen an influx of capital investment, the report titled 'Renewable Energy Market Review 2023' said.  The RE sector in India has seen an influx of capital investment and for this trend to continue, the risk profile of the power plant must be satisfactorily managed during the entire life cycle of the project. As the sector grows to its full potential, the role of intermediaries and specialists becomes even more critical,   Ankush Gupta, Practice Leader - Renewable Energy said in the report. The report further said that floating solar has gained traction and will play an important role in the energy transition of countries such as China, India and South Korea.

        "articleBody": "In order to meet their green goals, companies will need a combination of energy conservation and transition technologies, said Ben Driggs, president and CEO, global high growth regions, Honeywell. Companies large and small have all made public commitments. The challenge now is how are they going to meet them,  Driggs told the ET Global Business Summit.  And to meet those, there is never going to be one solution. It has to be a combination of energy conservation and energy transition. Several existing technologies can come in handy in achieving both conservation and transition, he said. But to achieve conservation, companies need to establish a baseline and deploy digital technology. When you think about energy conservation, something companies are really struggling with is to establish your baseline. Today most companies, when they estimate their emissions, it's done with a lot of assumptions,  Driggs said, adding that there was  no real scoreboard  to measure emissions and improvements.  Let's use digital technology, which is very much available today. Let's sensorise our factories and buildings. Using a smart algorithm can reduce energy consumption in buildings by 10-25%, he said. Factories may not see as much reduction as buildings but can still get a  high single-digit  reduction in energy consumption, Driggs said. Another  low-hanging area  is reducing methane leakage, he said. The gas has a big impact on the environment and technologies can help easily identify leakage and plug it. Leakage or flaring of natural gas by oil and gas companies has drawn much regulatory attention in the developed world in recent years.Optimal routing of aircraft or cargo trucks could also offer significant opportunities for energy consumption reduction, Driggs said.Biofuel is a big opportunity, Driggs said, adding that manufacturing it from a variety of sources, including cooking oil, agriculture waste and algae, and using it for sustainable fuels, would be a significant move. India is a major producer of ethanol today. But the technology now exists to take that ethanol and produce sustainable aviation fuel or green diesel and this can make a significant impact on the future of those segments and their sustainability impact,  Driggs said.",

        "articleBody": "India has the potential to attract an investment of over USD 20 billion in renewables in 2023 and requires a strong framework for sustainable power, say industry experts at the renewable energy conference REConIndia 2023 on Friday. Based on the discussion at REConIndia 2023, a white paper will be prepared on solar power challenges, roadmap to make green hydrogen viable, propelling wind energy and state of green financing in India, a statement said.  The conference was organised by Blue Circle on Friday, where experts, stakehoders and industry leaders deliberated on the key issues, challenges and opportunities in renewable energy in India.  Founder and CEO of Blue Circle Siddharth Anand said,  The industry estimates investment in excess of USD 20 billion in 2023 .  Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh in December 2022 also pegged the investment in renewables at around USD 25 billion in 2023.  Anand also stated that the REConIndia 2023 brought together key decision-makers, thought leaders, and experts from across the industry, creating a platform for collaborative thinking and problem-solving.  Alexander Hogeveen Rutter, Private Sector Specialist, International Solar Alliance, said that with a significant portion of wasteland at its disposal, India has the potential to unlock enormous opportunities by utilising it for setting up solar projects.  The development of floating solar fields is another area of exploration, which presents a unique advantage that the land beneath the panels can be used for farming by farmers who may have given up their land, Rutter added.  A strong framework for the development of solar projects on wasteland can help build a sustainable and self-reliant India, Rutter suggested.  Chairman, Blue Circle and MTaI, Pavan Choudary stated that there is increasing awareness and sensitivity towards sustainability.  Many sectors have started initiating positive changes. For example, the medical equipment sector is taking a lead by planning longer working lives for the chassis of their products and medical disposable manufacturers are exploring the use of bio-degradable materials to reduce the environmental impact of their products, he added.  CEO, NTPC Renewables, Mohit Bhargava stated as India races towards its target of achieving 280 GW of solar energy by 2030, it is imperative to increase the production of solar power.  Given the significant dependence on China for solar modules, India needs to step up its efforts to establish a robust domestic solar module manufacturing ecosystem, he suggested.  While the government's PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme holds promise, it may take time to yield results. Therefore, a holistic approach towards increasing domestic production capacities and incentivising domestic manufacturing is critical to meet India's renewable energy goals, he also suggested.  Pankaj Sindwani, Chief Business Officer, Tata Cleantech Capital, stressed on increasing efforts to attract global investment and compete more aggressively.  R P V Prasad, CEO-India, Envision Energy, said, as a renewable energy source, wind energy is expected to play a significant role in India's energy mix in the coming years.  It is projected that wind energy will contribute around 25 per cent of the total renewable energy production in India by 2030, he added.  REConIndia 2023 witnessed participation of more than 250 subject matter experts, policymakers, innovators, investors, and startup founders.",

        "articleBody": "India aims to become the first country in the world to industrialise without carbonising, G20 sherpa Amitabh Kant said at the ET Global Business Summit on Friday. The country\u2019s G20 presidency, which India assumed in December 2022, will allow it to drive twin global objectives of digital transformation and going green, thus reshaping history. India is aiming for decisive and action-oriented G20 meetings under its presidency toward this end, he said. \u201cIndia takes over the G20 presidency when the world is facing several challenges. While every challenge is an opportunity, India\u2019s priority for the G20 will be to drive digital transformation and go green,\u201d Kant said while addressing a session at the ET GBS. \u201cAs the PM said, India\u2019s presidency will be very action-oriented, inclusive, decisive and outcome-oriented.\u201dOutlining the challenges, Kant said one-third of the world is in recession, 75 countries are facing a global debt crisis and almost 200 million people have gone below the poverty line in the post-Covid era, while 100 million people have lost their jobs. \u201cThere's a very severe crisis of climate action and climate finance. And on top of all that you have a very severe crisis of geopolitics in Europe and there\u2019s a major challenge of fuel, food and fertiliser,\u201d he said.The G20 has become more crucial as the United Nations has become unwieldy and almost in-operational with one of its five Security Council member countries going to war.\u201cThe G20 accounts for 85% of global production, 78% of global trade, almost 90% of global patents and almost two-thirds of the world\u2019s population and, therefore, what the G20 decides is critical,\u201d he said. Hailing India\u2019s digital story, Kant said India\u2019s digital payments are 11 times more that of the US or Europe and four times that of China.India has built up a powerful alternative model that\u2019s about digital public goods and digital public infrastructure.\u201cIndia created the railway tracks on top of which the private sector innovated. It ensured that between 2014 and 2017, we were able to open 70 million new bank accounts, all of them were then linked to Aadhaar and to the mobile,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a completely different story from the Big Tech model of the US or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) model of Europe, where they laid emphasis on privacy but at the cost of innovation.\u201dAccording to Kant, India has focussed on both privacy and digital transformation through the data protection architecture where information is owned by citizens.\u201cCitizens give consent to enable many of these things to happen and therefore this transitional story is really the story of technological innovation for the world and for the future of the world and that is the way it will go,\u201d he said.Kant said it will be impossible for the world to grow, expand and progress without going digital and going green.\u201cIndia is not responsible for carbonising the world as we account for just 1.4% of the carbon space compared to our entitlement of about 17.5% on the per capita income basis,\u201d he said. \u201cIrrespective of that, India is committed to a very rapid green transition. It is the first and the only country amongst G20 nations to have achieved its climate goals and its NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) targets nine years ahead of schedule.\u201dReiterating Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s commitment of making India fossil fuel independent by 2047, Kant said the country is using renewable energy to crack water through electrolysis to become a green hydrogen producer.\u201cIndia has a huge opportunity to become the lowest cost producer of green hydrogen, the lowest cost exporter of hydrogen and the biggest manufacturer of electrolysis for the world. This is one of the biggest opportunities but the challenge is to bring down the prices of green hydrogen in India,\u201d he said.Kant said India will have to drive innovation to significantly lower the cost of green hydrogen from $4.5 per kilowatt hour right now to about $2.5 per kilowatt hour in the next three years and further bring it down it to $1.50 kilowatt per hour by 2030 to become the biggest exporter of green hydrogen.",

        "articleBody": "The early success of e-mobility in India can largely be attributed to a supportive policy landscape at the national and state level. Of the 36 states and Union Territories in the country, 26 have released EV policies over the last 5 years, with 16 of them being released between 2020 and 2022. However, none of them are on track to meet their targets of EV penetration, charging infrastructure or investments, according to a recent study. The study by Climate Trends, \u2018Analysis Of State Electric Vehicle Policies And Their Impact\u2019, has assessed the comprehensiveness of these state EV policies based on 21 parameters that cover targets and budget allocations, demand side and manufacturing incentives, and focus on fleet electrification, charging infrastructure mandates and job creation. The report also analysed the progress of 8 policies that have been active for two years or more. \u201cIt is a good sign that the majority of Indian states have EV policies, however a successful transition to zero emission transport depends on the effectiveness of their design and implementation. It also depends on having a national transport electrification target, which currently doesn\u2019t exist in India,\u201d said Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends.\u201cOur study shows that few state policies have comprehensive designs which balance EV sales, manufacturing and overall ecosystem growth. There are gaps in implementation, leading to slower on-ground impact, which need to be addressed through better regulation, improved monitoring, mechanisms and capacity building of stakeholders across the policy value chain,\u201d she added.As per the study, Maharashtra, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Punjab have most holistic EV policies while Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Kerala, and Uttarakhand's policies are least comprehensive, said the study.Nine states and UTs - Delhi, Odisha, Bihar, Chandigarh, Andaman & Nicobar, Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan and Meghalaya - have strongest demand side incentives, the study added. Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh have the strongest supply side incentives, with special support to boost EV manufacturing, apart from incentives offered in the state\u2019s industrial policy.Only 9 states have mandated the creation of charging infrastructure in new residential buildings, offices, parking lots, malls, etc: Chandigarh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Delhi, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, LadakhThe study also highlighted that only 8 states have specific targets for electrification of fleets such as last mile delivery vehicles, aggregator cabs, government vehicles: Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Andaman & NicobarIt said that EV penetration is below target in Madhya Pradesh at just 2.2% despite its target of 25% of all new registered vehicles to be electric by 2026 \u201cDelhi\u2019s EV penetration stands at 7.2% against its target of 25% by 2024. Tamil Nadu has no defined target but EV penetration is a mere 2.02% of registered vehicles,\u201d the study added.On electrification of public transport lagging, the study said that across all 8 states, penetration of electric buses is far below policy targets. Tamil Nadu aims for 5% of buses to be electric, but has no e-buses on ground yet. Kerala aims for 6,000 buses by 2025 but has only 56 on ground.It said charging infrastructure growth across states is also slow. \u201cDelhi, with the highest charging stations and points, has only made it to 9.6% of its 2024 target of having 30,000 charging stations. In all other 7 states, publicly available data shows public and semi public charging stations to be between 100 to 500 only.\u201d Seven states aimed to create green zones either under their Smart Cities Initiative, but none have progressed on this so far, it added. The report recommended states to reassess their policy designs to make them more comprehensive and well balanced for both, the growth of EV sales and overall EV ecosystem, as well as have a longer term vision till 2030. It also recommends greater focus on fleet electrification through mandates for cab aggregators, last mile delivery service and e-commerce companies. \u201cElectrification of public transport will be key for zero emissions transport, and all policies must build in mechanisms to achieve their bus electrification targets,\u201d the study said while prescribing need for monitoring policy implementation.Meanwhile, Pawan Mulukutla is Director, Integrated Transport, Electric Mobility and Hydrogen, WRI India suggested, \u201cWe need replicable models that can be modified by states to suit their requirements and scale adoption\u2026As financing continues to be a major bottleneck in large-scale EV adoption, exploring ways to leverage private sector financing for EV adoption is another critical requirement at this juncture.\u201dSiddharth Goel, Senior Policy Advisor at the International Institute for Sustainable Developmentsaid,  In the future, states should take into consideration their unique competitive advantages when designing EV policies...The implementation of the PLI-ACC and PLI-auto schemes, which provide incentives to businesses for the domestic manufacturing of batteries and EV auto components, provides a unique opportunity for states to attract significant investment, which can help create jobs and support sustainable growth.

        "articleBody": "India is on track to becoming one of the largest economies in the world, and account for 20% of the world's population, by the middle of this century. So there's no doubt about it: The choices India makes will increasingly impact the entire planet. In particular, India's actions to decarbonise, and to mitigate climate change, will be key to the world meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The Indian government's commitment to reaching energy independence by 2047, and attaining a net-zero economy by 2070, is a clear sign of the country's ambition to play its part, as does its G20 Presidency theme, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam or One Earth - One Family - One Future.India's economic progress to date gives it a potential advantage. For while the developed world's climate efforts need to focus on fixing a long-entrenched energy landscape, India can mould, develop, build, and reach for net-zero, at a much earlier stage.The crises of the past few years emphasise how important it is to bake the net-zero ambition into current development models, and deploy the full range of tools at India's disposal to get there even faster. In 2022 alone, geopolitical turmoil, plus some of the worst climate-related disasters on record, showed how vulnerable societies and economies can be when their energy models rely too heavily on carbon-dense energy sources provided by a limited number of suppliers. So, what does India need to do? Shifting the energy supply away from fossil fuels towards renewables such as solar and wind is a critical part of the story. But while renewables tend to grab the limelight in media headlines and roundtable discussions, there's much more to the energy transition than that. 97959996It's about empowering all to manage energy far more effectively and efficiently. And that, in turn, is about deploying the digital technologies that allow factories, buildings, infrastructure operators, even households, to measure how much energy is - or will be - consumed. Software, artificial intelligence, and data analytics: all these allow us to control and adapt our usage for maximum efficiency - decreasing energy demand, energy bills, and carbon emissions.The other way to attain greater efficiency is electrifying how we drive, heat our buildings, and cook our food. That means making sure that buildings are powered by electric heat pumps rather than gas or wood, and that cars and public transport shift away from combustion engines to electric versions, which not only emit fewer emissions, but are more efficient, too. It also means mobilising more Indians to make use of localised energy-generation technologies like rooftop solar panels and microgrids. These allow individual households and buildings both to generate and store their own clean electricity, gaining greater independence from the grid.97960019Green hydrogen will play a complementary role, helping to decarbonize those harder-to-abate sectors such as aviation, chemical or steel and, possibly long-duration storage, allowing for the storage of those green energy sources. Building out a completely new energy model that enables access to safe, clean and reliable energy to India's 1.4 billion population may seem like a faraway dream. I would argue that it is, in fact, a reality within our grasp. And it is an opportunity for India, in reaching for its Amrit Kaal, to demonstrate, and bolster, its leadership in digital adoption, sustainability action and human capital development.After all, the technologies already exist. It's now a question of deploying them at speed and scale, and embracing the mentality that going forward, everything new must be built to be net-zero carbon.Doing so will bolster India's energy access and security. It will tackle climate change. And, it will help secure a sustainable future for not only India, but for the entire world.",

        "articleBody": "The European Commission on Tuesday proposed tougher CO2 limits for heavy goods vehicles, requiring new trucks by 2040 to cut emissions by 90% and all new city buses to have zero emissions from 2030. The aim is to bring the transport sector in line with the European Union's goal to achieve zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as well as to reduce demand for imported fossil fuels. Already last year, the 27-nation bloc agreed a 2035 deadline for new cars to be CO2-free. The Commission proposed on Tuesday that from 2040, manufacturers would need to reduce the average CO2 emissions of the new trucks they sell by 90%, compared with 2019 levels. They would also face a 65% CO2 cut from 2035 and a 45% cut from 2030. The 90% target falls short of the zero emissions goal that countries including the Netherlands sought. Some EU countries - which must negotiate the final law with the European Parliament - have said 2040 is too soon for manufacturers to meet a zero emissions target, diplomats said. The proposal disappointed campaigners, who said new CO2-emitting trucks registered in 2040 would still be on the road in 2050 - thwarting the bloc's net zero deadline.  Polluting trucks will continue to be sold for years longer than necessary, making the EU's net zero goal impossible,  said Fedor Unterlohner, freight manager at campaign group Transport & Environment. Trucks in the EU were, on average, 14 years old in 2020, according to data published last year by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Swedish truck maker AB Volvo started series production of heavy electric trucks last year, and aims for half of its global truck deliveries to be electric by 2030. Other routes to decarbonise trucks include switching from combustion engines to hydrogen fuel cells, although these are not expected to be available in large numbers until the second half of this decade.",

        "articleBody": "The Union Budget 2023 presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman builds on India\u2019s commitment to lead the global action against climate change, preserve biodiversity and support sustainable development. The promised capital outlay and policy frameworks to support a range of specific initiatives are aimed at accelerating clean transition and sustainable growth.The budget further defines India\u2019s firm stance on green growth by articulating the government\u2019s strategy for economic development with a focus on sustainable development. The announcements in the budget resonate with India\u2019s climate change policies and are aligned with the country\u2019s net zero goals, COP27 commitments and the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).The government has accelerated the pace of green growth as India is facing the grave reality of depleting natural resources, limited supply of water, minerals, and fossil fuels as it surpasses China to become the most populous country. Moreover, according to the Environment Performance Index of 2022, India was 169th out of 180 nations. According to another report, India suffered a loss of ~5.4% of its GDP and 167 billion potential labour hours owing to extreme heat in 2021. With the country experiencing 314 days of extreme weather events in 2022, and climate change making heatwaves in India 30 times more likely, green growth assumes greater significance.In a bid to counter the climate threat, India has committed to achieving net zero by 2070; released a low-carbon development strategy; and introduced the concept of \u2018LiFE\u2019 (Lifestyle for Environment) to promote responsible consumption. Sovereign Green Bonds, which were introduced in the previous budget as a new avenue of raising finance for green initiatives, recently witnessed a successful maiden auction. Bids worth Rs 32,892 crore were received, which is about four times the offer, indicating a healthy demand for them. Paving the green wayBuilding onto its commitments, the government has adopted \u2018Green Growth\u2019 as one of the seven key priorities (Saptarshi) to lead India in its \u2018Amrit Kaal\u2019.The Green Growth actions include several pointed measures that will have a ripple effect. For instance, the allocation of Rs 35,000 crore of priority capital investment towards achieving net zero by 2070 and clean energy transition ensures the country\u2019s energy security. The outlay of Rs 19,700 crore for the Green Hydrogen Mission will mobilise a green hydrogen production capacity of 5 metric million tonnes by 2030. This would facilitate the much-needed steady decarbonisation of Indian industries, reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports and establish technology and market leadership in this sunrise sector.The other key initiatives around the clean energy transition include viability gap funding for 4,000 MWh battery energy storage systems, a framework for pump storage projects, and an investment of Rs 20,000 crore for evacuation and interstate transmission systems of renewable energy.Biodiversity conservation, agriculture in spotlightThe 2023 budget firmly intends towards biodiversity and natural resource conservation. An array of initiatives announced align India with the Global Biodiversity Framework at the UN Biodiversity Conference. The government has also proposed mangrove plantations along the coastline and salt pan lands under the MISTI initiative (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes) that would employ MGNREGS, CAMPA Fund and other resources.To encourage the optimal use of wetlands, enhance biodiversity, carbon stock, eco-tourism opportunities and income generation for local communities, the Amrit Dharohar scheme will be implemented over three years.The budget includes initiatives for green agriculture as agricultural activities are considered a major contributor (14% by some estimates) to the total greenhouse gas emissions. The new initiative of PM-PRANAM (PM Programme for Restoration, Awareness, Nourishment and Amelioration of Mother Earth), for example, promotes alternative fertilisers and balanced use of chemical fertilisers. To encourage natural farming adoption by 10 million farmers over three years, the FM has proposed to set up 10,000 Bio-Input Resource Centres, creating a national-level distributed micro-fertiliser and pesticide manufacturing network.In addition to the above, under the new \u2018Atmanirbhar Clean Plant Programme\u2018, a capital outlay of Rs 2,200 crore is planned to improve the availability of disease-free quality planting material for high-value horticultural crops.Other hits and missesUnder circularity, 500 new \u2018waste to wealth\u2019 plants will be established under the new GOBARdhan (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan) scheme with a total investment of Rs 10,000 crore. The government intends to notify the Green Credit program under the Environment (Protection) Act, which would encourage behavioural change and incentivise environmentally sustainable and responsive actions by companies, individuals, and local bodies.However, in a divergence from the previous budget\u2019s approach, the National Climate Change Action Plan, the National Adaptation Fund and the National Mission on Himalayan Studies received no fund allocation.The bottom lineThe Indian economy is expected to grow at ~7% in the current year, and \u2018Green Growth\u2019 is likely to act as an enabler in multiple ways: cleaner transition, creating green jobs and promoting sustainable development. With the budget announcements, India's highly dynamic sustainability landscape demonstrates the government\u2019s sincere intention. It also underlines the urgency for industry sectors, corporates and their value chain stakeholders to adopt responsible and cleaner business practices. This shift presents new opportunities for long-term value creation, contributing towards a prosperous future for India.The author is Partner, Climate Change and Sustainability Services, EY India",

The Asian Economic Integration Report (AEIR) 2023, released by ADB said Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change risks, yet it emits the largest volume of carbon dioxide.  Annual temperatures have risen faster in the last 30 years than in any other region, and are now 0.86\u00b0C above the 1981-2010 average. Asia is also increasingly facing more extreme precipitation incidences such as storms, floods, and landslides, having borne the brunt of almost 40 per cent of disasters worldwide in the past 2 decades.  Ironically, it is responsible for about a half of global annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the AEIR said.   Asia and the Pacific's remarkable growth has lifted millions of people out of poverty, but this has come at an environmental cost,  said ADB Chief Economist Albert Park.  While trade and investment have fuelled remarkable economic growth in Asia in recent decades, it has also led to large increase in carbon dioxide emissions in the region-which is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than any other.  Reversing this trend will require measures such as promoting trade in environmental goods and services, nurturing green businesses, developing carbon pricing mechanisms, and strengthening regional cooperation through trade and investment agreements, it said.   Trade agreements can be useful for fostering climate policies, yet further progress needs to be made... In addition, trade facilitation measures, in particular those promoting digitalization, can help reduce carbon emissions by increasing transparency, simplifying customs procedures, improving border agency coordination, and shortening delays at borders.   Raising the coverage and depth of environment and climate change provisions or incorporating a separate chapter on climate change mitigation efforts into regional trade agreements can help ensure their effectiveness in achieving climate goals,  the AEIR said.  Clean and renewable energy goods-such as solar panels and wind turbines-and resource-efficiency goods are critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.   The region now finds itself on the frontline of the climate crisis, which can derail development progress. Trade and investment remain one of the most important drivers for growth and poverty reduction, but governments in the region need to intensify their cooperation to make trade and investment greener,  Park added.  With regard to the trade in the Asia region, the ADB report said after the strong rebound in 2021 pushed Asia's merchandise trade volume 11.3 per cent higher than its pre-pandemic level, growth in trade has moderated in 2022 and high frequency data indicate a slowdown in the region's trade growth momentum.   To mitigate food security risks posed by supply shocks and logistical hurdles, policy makers should strengthen international cooperation to eliminate trade restrictions and streamline commodity supply chains, promote trade facilitation, and cultivate alternative transportation routes,  the AEIR said.  The Asia Pacific region's international trade share was high at 58.2 per cent in 2021, with strong regional value chain, especially in its primary and low-tech sectors. Recent trade cooperation offered by new bilateral and regional trade agreements is expected to help deepen regional value chain linkages further, ADB said.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged international companies on Monday to invest in India's fossil fuel as well as green energy industries while presenting the country's strategy for the energy sector and the tremendous opportunities it offered.Modi also held a meeting with representatives of ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Rosneft and a few other global firms in a rare instance of senior executives of Western majors as well as the Russian giant coming together in a room since the start of the Ukraine war last February. Today India is the most suitable place in the world for your investment,  Modi told investors on the inaugural day of the India Energy Week, which saw the participation of top industry names such as Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, Opec Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais, and International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol. Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman, however, wasn't present.Modi said India's expanding energy demand was creating new investment opportunities. India's share in the global oil demand is expected to rise to 11% from the current 5%, while the country's gas demand is estimated to rise 500%, Modi said, without giving a timeline.One million sq km of additional areas is now available for exploring fossil fuels after the government reduced 'no-go' areas, he said.  Unprecedented possibilities are emerging in India that is moving with a resolution of a Viksit Bharat. Modi laid out the four verticals of the Indian energy strategy - expanding domestic exploration, supply diversification, increasing alternative energy sources, and expanding the role of EVs and hydrogen in decarbonisation.The government is working on mission mode to increase the consumption of natural gas in our energy mix from 6% to 15% by 2030.  The government is trying to increase the capacity of LNG terminal regasification,  the PM said, adding that the gas pipeline network will expand further to 35,000 km in five years. The PM underscored the country is aiming to produce five MMTPA green hydrogen by this decade-end with \u20b98 lakh crore in possible investments. He added India will raise the share of green hydrogen to 25% by replacing grey hydrogen.The PM expressed confidence that the \u20b918,000 crore PLI will encourage manufacturing of advanced chemistry cells of 50 GWh as currently battery costs account for about half the cost of the car.Modi flagged off the Green Mobility Rally where vehicles powered by green energy sources would participate to help create public awareness. He also launched E20 fuel at 84 retail outlets of OMCs. E20 is petrol blended with 20% ethanol. Modi also launched IOC's solar cooking system as well as the initiative to make uniforms from recycled PET bottles.",

        "articleBody": "The crisis facing billionaire Gautam Adani has revealed a potential pitfall in India\u2019s ambitious plan to reduce emissions: its reliance on the country\u2019s most affluent and powerful private citizens.Led by Adani\u2019s $70 billion pledged investment in green energy infrastructure, India\u2019s tycoons have so far committed to spend far more than the government on the energy transition. Reliance Industries Ltd.\u2019s Mukesh Ambani and JSW Group\u2019s Sajjan Jindal, along with energy giants like Tata Group, have also rushed to champion the shift to a cleaner future.But Hindenburg Research\u2019s allegations about companies linked to Adani Group have raised doubt on the firm\u2019s future, including its massive green energy investment. It\u2019s also created problems for Adani Green, the group\u2019s renewable energy arm. The storm engulfing Asia\u2019s now second-richest man also threatens to spread to the other conglomerates; Hindenburg Research has raised questions about the country\u2019s corporate governance.Because Adani group is a dominant player in India\u2019s clean energy industries, the pace of investment might slow, said Ashiwni Swain, fellow at New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research. \u201cWe cannot bank on two or three companies to reach our goals. We need a populated sector,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other players and many more will join to take the journey forward.\u201dIndia\u2019s national climate blueprint sets 2070 as a goal for net zero emissions, 10 years after China and two decades behind Europe. India will continue to expand its coal power fleet to alleviate energy shortages, prompting the government last month to defend its use of fossil fuels while in the same breath vowing to to remain committed to decarbonization.To meet its goal, India requires investment of $160 billion annually through 2030, roughly triple today\u2019s levels, according to the International Energy Agency. Foreign direct investment, while growing, remains a fraction of current commitments. Adani\u2019s rapid downfall may undermine investor confidence in India more broadly, threatening to curb capital flows into the nation for green financing. 97631835The gap highlights the government\u2019s dependence on its private sector to hit its green goals. While private capital will be needed to fight climate change all over the world, the sheer size of India\u2019s challenges makes it more reliant on its richest citizens and most sprawling companies.Executives have so far been happy to oblige, as the prize is a top-spot in the lucrative industries of tomorrow. Adani and Reliance\u2019s Ambani are vying to become the single biggest investor in India\u2019s green sector, with the billionaires constantly one-upping each other with fresh announcement of giant manufacturing plants and some of the world\u2019s largest projects.Adani has often aligned his businesses with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s development goals and is characterizing Hindenburg Research\u2019s charges of fraud as an attack against his home country. At the same time, Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh told reporters in New Delhi on Thursday that there are more than a dozen large firms that can push India\u2019s agenda forward.Adani, who made his billions on the back of his coal empire, positioned himself as one of the leading advocate for new and experimental green technology. He is planning enormous solar and wind manufacturing centers across the country, and developing a supply chain for the world\u2019s cheapest green hydrogen aimed at positioning India as an exporter of the clean fuel.But some environmental advocates point out that Adani and his company were never that green to begin with. Adani doubled down on coal production last year as Modi promised to bring reliable electricity to more Indians amid a global fuel supply crunch. The group\u2019s mining operations account for at least 3% of global CO2 emissions from coal, according to SumOfUs, an activist group that runs campaigns intended to apply pressure to powerful corporations.\u201cIndia is lot more than Adani. Their role in India\u2019s energy transition is disputable,\u201d said Assaad Razzouk, chief executive officer of Singapore-based renewable firm Gurin Energy. \u201cIt is very dangerous to confuse the energy transition in India with one group\u2019s perspective or market power.\u201dIndia plans to decrease the share of fossil fuels in the nation\u2019s electricity mix to 50% by 2030, down from more than 57% today. India still relies heavily on coal for power generation, with demand for the dirtiest fossil fuel expected to inch higher through 2025, and critics say the government needs to do more to limit global warming.The most immediate near-term consequence of the current Adani rout is that it will be more difficult for the billionaire to raise money to fuel its green expansion. There\u2019s also an open question about the debt at Adani Green Energy Ltd., the unit that is developing renewable projects. The debt-to-capital ratio for the firm soared to 95.3% in the previous fiscal year ended March, according to Bloomberg calculations. It has since declined to 88.5% but remains higher than its peers. 97631841Adani Green has the highest funding risk of the group companies due to its weak balance sheet, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, adding that the firm has $1.25 billion worth of bonds due next year. \u201cAdani Green Energy\u2019s cash as of September cannot cover short-term debt maturities,\u201d the analysts said.\u201cWill this damage Adani? Categorically. It should have already,\u201d said Tim Buckley, the director of the Sydney-based Climate Energy Finance think tank and a long-time observer of the billionaire. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a lot of Western capital will now avoid the Adani group. It is going to put Adani\u2019s ability to access global western capital, and in particular green capital and ESG capital,\u201d at risk.",

This event will showcase India as a global powerhouse for energy transition,  said Hardeep Singh Puri, India's minister for petroleum and natural gas. Puri's ministry is organizing the event. But Puri added that  India's clean energy targets needs to be weighed against the country's growing economy and rising energy requirements.  The country is set to become the world's most populous nation this year. India is currently the third highest emitter of planet-warming gases but has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2070 and dramatically ramp up its renewable energy capacity. Ahead of the event, IEA's Birol praised India's climate efforts, saying the country  can help drive the global agenda on clean energy transitions and energy security, with its focus on addressing technology gaps, ensuring diversified supply chains, scaling up clean fuels for the future, and mobilizing investment.  Most of the Indian participants at the event belong to either government-owned or private fossil fuel companies, sparking concerns from climate experts.  Gas expansion, which at least in India's context does not make too much sense, needs looking into,  said Aarti Khosla of New Delhi-based climate think-tank, Climate Trends.  While India energy week talks about the role of gas as a bridge fuel for energy security, it is proven that there are risks ... banks are not lending too much to gas and global sentiment of investors is shifting slowly away from gas as well.  But others say it's important to keep the conversation with fossil fuels interests going as they remain key players in energy.  A country like India presently needs fossil fuels to keep the lights on,  said Bharath Jairaj, who leads the World Resources Institute India's energy program.  We can't just assume some sectors should not or cannot be discussed, not until we find reliable, affordable and secure alternatives.  Stakeholders from clean energy companies will also be in attendance. Sumant Sinha, the CEO of Renew Power, one of India's largest renewable energy companies, sees the energy week as a forum to understand various stakeholders' viewpoints.  A lot of global energy companies that we can potentially partner with will be there,  said Sinha.  And look, the reality is that even the oil and gas companies are shifting to renewables. Therefore its important for us to engage. It's always good to see what the rest of the energy ecosystem is thinking about.  India Energy Week runs Feb. 6-10 and will coincide with the first meeting of the G-20 energy transition working group. The Asian ministerial energy roundtable, where energy ministers from key Asian countries will meet, will also be held as part of the event in Bengaluru.",

        "articleBody": "Keeping pace with the green energy focus of the world and reducing its carbon intensity, India has planned big for the green energy sector in its financial budget. The government announced a slew of measures for the initiatives related to green fuel, green farming, green mobility, green buildings, and green equipment. Also since India has an ongoing G20 Presidency, its focus on green energy will have a better impact. The government announced an outlay of Rs 19,700 crore for the recently launched National Green Hydrogen Mission, which it said will facilitate the transition of the economy to low carbon intensity, reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports and make the country  assume technology and market leadership in this sunrise sector . It has a target of the annual production of 500 MMT (million metric tonnes) of green hydrogen by 2030, reported The Hindu.  The Union Budget presents a positive outlook for the renewable energy sector in India. The allocation of Rs 35,000 crore towards the green energy transition is a step in the right direction and demonstrates the nation's will for a sustainable future,  commented Girish R Tanti, Vice Chairman, Suzlon Energy.  The government's commitment to increasing the use of renewable energy in the country is commendable and will play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the impact of climate change. The National Green Hydrogen Mission will complement our efforts towards net zero,  he said. The budget provides Rs 35,000 crores for priority capital investment toward energy transition, net zero objectives, and energy security the Union Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Industry body ASSOCHAM's Secretary General Deepak Sood said,  Boost to transition through definite programmes for financing green energy with the help of flagship programmes like National Green Hydrogen Mission, grid integration of the renewable energy and promoting electrification of the automobile industry are the 'stand out features of the Budget' . India's energy demand is expected to increase more than that of any other country in the coming decades due to its sheer size and enormous potential for growth and development. Therefore, it is imperative that most of this new energy demand is met by low-carbon, renewable sources. India's announcement that it intends to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070 and to meet 50 per cent of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030 marks a historic point in the global effort to combat climate change. The Indian renewable energy sector is the fourth most attractive renewable energy market in the world. India was ranked fourth in wind power, fifth in solar power and fourth in renewable power installed capacity, as of 2020.Installed renewable power generation capacity has gained pace over the past few years, posting a CAGR of 15.92 per cent between FY16-22. India is the market with the fastest growth in renewable electricity, and by 2026, new capacity additions are expected to double, according to India Brand Equity Foundation. With India holding the Presidency of the G20 till Nov 2023, the focus on adopting green energy, and efforts to enhance BioCNG bodes well. We are pleased with the focus that the Budget has had for our industry, in particular, esp. from the point of view of scrapping old/polluting vehicles, stressing the need to segregate waste and more importantly make and prep the cities to raise funds from the Municipal Bond market. The main theme reiterates the Country's focus on adopting sustainable technologies, and higher focus on generating green energy,  said Jose Jacob Managing Director of Antony Waste Handling Cell.As of October 2022, India's installed renewable energy capacity (including hydro) stood at 165.94 GW, representing 40.6 per cent of the overall installed power capacity. The country is targeting about 450 Gigawatt (GW) of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 - about 280 GW (over 60 per cent) is expected from solar.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai: Reinforcing its push towards green mobility, the government has nearly doubled its budgetary allocation for the FAME (faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles) scheme to subsidise the purchase of electric vehicles.As per the budget document, the subsidy under the FAME scheme for fiscal 2024 is projected at Rs 5,172 crore, compared with the revised estimate of Rs 2,897 crore in the current fiscal year. This is the highest allocation under the scheme since its launch in 2020. The FAME-2 subsidy accounted for 85% of the total budget allocation for the ministry of heavy industries. This comes amid reports of alleged wrongful claims by various manufacturers and a government probe. 97561181The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has flagged issues with the implementation of the FAME scheme to the ministry of heavy industries. DRI has initiated a probe into the imports, ET reported on Wednesday, citing a senior government official. The investigation covers import of electric vehicle (EV) components and likely customs duty evasion.With provision of subsidy spending of Rs 5,172 crore, the cumulative subsidy spending will reach Rs 9,687 crore between FY20 and FY24. So far, more than 750,000 vehicle units have been benefited by the FAME-2 scheme. Nothing has changed in the allocation. The figure given is the leftover budget in FY24, that was declared in 2019,  Sohinder Gill, director general, Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV), said commenting on the subsidy allocation.Uday Narang, founder of Omega Seiki Mobility, said while the allocation is a welcome step and will pave the way for electric mobility, the disbursement of the funds has been an issue.  We haven't got the funds for five months and the delays are hurting us badly,  said Narang. He said while he understands that the delays are due to wrongful claims by some manufacturers, the government shouldn't paint everyone with the same brush.Demand for EVs in India has taken off and the government is seeking to accelerate it. According to data from the government's Vahaan portal, India registered 1.008 million battery-operated vehicles (BOVs) in 2022, compared with 32,5000 in the previous year.Consequently, the share of BOVs in the total vehicle sales rose to 4.71% in 2022, as against 1.73% in the previous year. The penetration level is substantially higher in the scooter segment where penetration has reached over 15% and monthly sales volumes have reached around 70,000 units. On YTD basis, electric 2w registration volume stood at 559,000 units, which is nearly four times of the previous year's registration in the same period.",

Singh's statement comes at a time when opposition party members have joined hands in both the houses of the Parliament demanding suspension of regular proceedings to discuss the allegations of fraud against the Adani Group.  The proceedings of Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha were completely washed out on Thursday due to the issue.  Asked about the impact of the issue on clean energy sector, Singh told reporters in a press conference,  I have the most robust renewable energy capacity in the world and that means that I have at least 15-16 large companies which are at the level of global companies. It will not impact us in any way. We have many large companies and those are some of the biggest renewable energy companies in the world.   The opposition parties have also sought a probe by a joint committee into the rout in Adani group companies stocks.  The opposition has demanded suspension of regular business of Parliament to discuss the Adani group stock route issue and its impact on millions of small investors as well as the hard-earned savings of crores of Indians being endangered in loss of value of investments of LIC.  The rout in Adani group stocks has threatened the value of investments made by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and public sector banks.  Adani group stocks, where LIC is heavily invested, have lost over USD 100 billion in value since the tiny New York firm came out with a damning report alleging financial and accounting fraud by the ports-to-energy conglomerate.  The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements. It termed the Hindenburg report baseless and threatened to sue the short seller.  On Wednesday night, Adani Enterprises announced that it has decided not to go ahead with its Rs 20,000-crore follow-on Public Offer (FPO) and will return the proceeds to investors. The announcement came a day after the FPO was fully subscribed on the last day on Tuesday.",

        "articleBody": "The viability gap funding for battery storage and a proposed framework for pumped storage power plants announced in the budget will help achieve India\u2019s renewable energy targets by mitigating the intermittent nature of such sources. The budget has also provided Rs. 35,000 crores of capital investments towards energy transition, net zero objectives, and energy security.\u201cThe announcement of viability gap funding for battery energy storage systems project with capacity 4000 MWh will help to advance the battery projects in India and will support higher renewable adoptions for the grid,\u201d said Debi Prasad Dash, Executive Director, of India Energy Storage Alliance.Battery storage technologies are essential to speed up the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy.The move will also help Solar Energy Corporation of India, NTPC Ltd and various state agencies to come up with more battery storage projects in India, Dash added.The increased capacity addition of variable renewable energy resources in recent years has emphasized the need for grid flexibility to accommodate its inherent intermittency, a report from India Smart Grid Forum said earlier.The grid stability is a growing concern for power distribution companies and they have been seeking technical and policy measures to sustain the uptake of variable renewable energy resources, according to the report.Pump storage converts electrical energy to gravitational potential energy, generally by pumping water up and re-converted to electricity by running the water down through a turbine.The upward pumping of water is likely to be done during the non-peak hours with the help of abundant solar and wind energy. Battery storage, on the other hand, captures energy from different sources, accumulates it and stores it for later use.Cost of battery storage is currently unaffordable, according to industry participants.The cost range of a lithium-ion battery per energy in each full discharge of 0.24 to 4 plus hours comes around $250-800/kWh, according to the report from ISGF.The country aims to achieve \u2018net-zero\u2019 emission by 2070, reach 500 GW of power capacity from non-fossil fuel by 2030 and get 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030.\u201cA rocket ship of Rs. 35,000 crore capital outlay provided by FM as India heads for its net zero \u2018Panchamrit\u2019 goal by 2070 and 5 million metric tonnes annual production (green hydrogen) by 2030. A promising step in the right direction,\u201d said Jimit Devani, Partner, Deloitte India.A green credit programme will also be notified under the Environment (Protection) Act which will incentivize environmentally sustainable and responsive actions by companies, individuals and local bodies, and help mobilize additional resources for such activities.",

        "articleBody": "President Droupadi Murmu on Tuesday said India has achieved the target of making 40 per cent of its electricity generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, a success that has strengthened the resolve to achieve Net Zero by 2070. In her maiden address to the joint sitting of Parliament marking the beginning of the Budget Session, Murmu said India was also progressing rapidly towards achieving the target of 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol.   India has also changed the perception, which considers progress and nature as contradictory,  she said addressing lawmakers in the Central Hall of Parliament.  She said the government has increased the solar power capacity by almost 20 times in the last eight years and India now ranks fourth in the world in renewable energy capacity.   My government is focusing on green growth and is emphasizing on connecting the entire world with Mission LiFE,  Murmu said.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced Mission LiFE at the climate conference in Glasgow in 2021 urging nations to replace the prevalent 'use and dispose' economy with a circular economy defined by mindful and deliberate utilisation.  Net Zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible. India has committed to achieve Net Zero by 2070.  Murmu said her government has also approved the Hydrogen Mission which was going to attract investment worth lakhs of crores of rupees in India in the field of green energy.   This will result in reducing our dependence on foreign countries for clean energy and also for energy security,  she said.  The President said reducing pollution in cities was also the top priority of her government and work was underway on a very large scale for electric mobility.   Under the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) scheme, more than 7,000 electric buses are being added to public transport by the central government in many cities of the country, including the capital city of Delhi. In the last eight years, metro network in the country has increased more than three times,  she said.  Murmu noted that metro projects were underway in 27 cities and more than 100 new waterways were also being developed across the country.   These new waterways will help transform the transport sector in the country,  she said.  Murmu said her government has constantly laid unprecedented emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship.   This is harnessing the strength of our country with the world's youngest population. Today our youth are demonstrating the power of their innovation to the world,  she said.   In 2015, India was ranked 81st in the Global Innovation Index. Now it has reached the 40th position. Seven years earlier, there were only a few hundred registered start-ups in India, today this number is almost 90,000,  Murmu said.",

        "articleBody": "The upcoming Union Budget is possibly the one with most expectations. India, a beacon of hope amid global recessionary concerns, reflects resilience and a high probability of emerging as a USD 5 trillion economy, while keeping net zero and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) commitments at the core. There is also curiosity about how the government can fix demand and growth amidst inflation and interest rates that have not been benign.Spending thrust is expected to persist, infrastructure development will continue to take centre stage, and the focus would be on boosting rural demand. To balance a distressing deficit, the Hon\u2019ble Minister could possibly take the green route, enabled by monetary and fiscal mechanisms, industry participation, and a focus on the long term. This would also give India a chance to flatten the Environmental Kuznets Curve.Unlike the dashes of green in earlier budget editions, the government has an opportunity to now fully go green \u2013 to incentivise green products, drive responsible consumption, raise resources, and deploy them effectively. The Reserve Bank of India and Securities and Exchange Board have released discussion papers and guidance on the sustainability agenda. The Ministry has considered a sustainable finance taxonomy or leveraging sustainable finance innovatively in a consultative manner. A silver lining has been the International Financial Services Centres Authority\u2019s guidance framework on sustainability-linked lending, that prescribes developing a board level policy, and to allocate 5% of new lending towards such sustainable financing. The Energy Conservation Act has paved the way for domestic carbon markets; however, operationalizing the market to ensure that adaptation and nature-based solutions receive the right focus and a mechanism for stabilizing prices will be vital.Considering India\u2019s commitment to being net-zero by 2070, it is time we bring a green budget to Lifestyle for Environment, LiFE. This budget can actualise Prime Minister\u2019s vision of LiFE and take it to the masses, positioning India to inspire the world with a roadmap of how a large developing economy can be resource and carbon efficient.The budget could leverage five key areas to grow and accelerate sustainable finance deployment:1. Developing a sustainable finance taxonomy: The European Union (EU) has already taken lead in developing and using such a framework. For India, this framework would also require us to include aspects around social measures that are currently missing in the EU framework. This framework would provide clear direction to financial institutions, be a breakthrough in channelizing mainstream sustainable finance, and limit greenwashing risks. It would be the first step towards ascertaining investments and determining the efforts required. This will also help India in tracking investments towards climate action and sustainable development.2. Fee-Bates to create a green market: In 2017, coal cess was merged with Goods & Services Tax (GST) to compensate states for their revenue shortfall for five years. The GST system must now pay back the green fund via incentives for green products and significantly reduce or eliminate any GST on purchase of any green products as may be categorized basis a clear mandate. The Ministry could consider a green rating/labelling of the products, levy higher GST on polluting/non-sustainable products, and offer rebates to green products. This will bring in cost effectiveness and encourage green procurement by organizations.3. Scale up ongoing efforts: Renewable energy deployment has been India\u2019s tool for fighting climate change, but its scale up towards the goal of 500 GW by 2030 needs more investment - as much as USD 300 billion by 2030[1]. A regulatory framework that further catalyzes flow of international capital towards climate action is crucial.4. Leveraging green bonds beyond renewable energy sector: Announcement of sovereign green bonds brought a loud cheer globally. Two key aspects can be looked at:Investing in resilience financing: Floods and storms in India alone led to a loss of USD 7.6 bn in 2021, and the nation witnessed natural disasters almost every day in the first three quarters of the year. The sovereign green bond can strengthen the development of resilient infrastructure in vulnerable areas and make it future proof. A concessional tax rate or an exemption on interest payments on green bonds can help attract investment and optimize overall cost of capital for development.Investing in sunrise sectors: Given the need to focus on LiFE, green bonds can take climate solutions to the grassroots through concessional financing of green homes, developing EV and public transport infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and efficient urban water and waste management. Green bonds can also support and empower new climate tech such as carbon capture, utilization and storage. This assumes greater significance in the hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement, and petroleum, in view of India\u2019s net zero ambitions. 5. Nodal point for deployment and monitoring of developmental financing: While the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) can be a gamechanger, its success will depend on how well it deploys long-term financing and creates an ecosystem to crowd in private financing and high leverage.A Green Budget can reinforce India\u2019s strong intent towards its climate goals and supercharge sustainable growth. Not only does it offer India an opportunity to walk the talk, but also demonstrate commitment on the SDGs, as it takes forward the sustainability, inclusion and climate action agenda as the President of G20.Shivananda Shetty is Partner and Head, ESG, KPMG in India and Chandan Bhavnani is Technical Director, ESG, KPMG in India",

        "articleSection": "Industry",
        "articleBody": "India has ambitious plans to increase the share of its non-fossil power capacity to 50 per cent by 2030. However, power generation from renewables is intermittent, and thermal projects often run for extended hours to stabilise this variability. This is where the storage of renewable energy becomes critical. It allows power operators and consumers to store renewable energy and release it when needed. Most energy storage systems are versatile, modular and can be deployed anywhere in the power grid and at any scale. Ramping up grid storage is critical for India to meet its renewable energy targets and consequently, cut carbon emissions. The upcoming Union Budget can be leveraged to showcase India\u2019s vision to develop a vibrant energy storage ecosystem.Based on announced policy targets, analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) suggests that the cumulative energy storage requirements for India until FY 2030 would be 850-950 GWh. Approximately 25-30 per cent of the total requirement will be for power grid support and the remaining will be used to run electric vehicles.Despite this huge potential for grid support, the sector has not seen the progress and growth it warrants. There are two main reasons for this. First, until now, the grid has been able to absorb most of the renewable energy, and second, lack of clarity on the role of energy storage has kept power distribution companies (or discoms) and the industry on the fence on investments. In the forthcoming Budget, a continued thrust is expected on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Here, energy storage will be an important element of India\u2019s decarbonisation strategy and we recommend three key steps to scale up its deployment in the power sector.First, central and state agencies need to double down on their decarbonisation commitments. Changes in the power tariff design (rationalisation and time of day) and infrastructure planning (smart meters and grid integration of batteries) are required to realise the true potential of energy storage systems. Many state governments allow consumers to use the grid as a large storage system. Through initiatives like net-metering and banking, consumers can feed in excess renewable energy into the grid and withdraw it later. Until recently, India had no long-term plans for grid energy storage deployments. In July 2022, the Ministry of Power released the Energy Storage Obligations (ESO) recommending that discoms increase their share of energy storage to four per cent of yearly consumption by FY 29-30. While this is an important step, the implementation lies with state governments. The ESO can face similar challenges as the Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) on measurement, tracking and compliance. As the share of renewable energy grows, integrating high levels of solar and wind power during their peak production hours may become a challenge. The trajectory shared by the Ministry should be adopted by State Electricity Regulatory Commissions immediately. Policies should not just be directed to generate renewable energy but must also find ways to integrate it and eventually replace thermal power. In the previous Budget, energy storage was added to the 'Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure\u2019 to increase the flow of finance in the sector. This year, the central government must allocate additional financial support (like viability gap funding) to rapidly scale up energy storage for various applications in the power sector.Second, provide financial support to central agencies for securing critical minerals. Lithium-ion batteries will have the largest share in energy storage installations. Currently, China has an 85-90 per cent share in most parts of the lithium-ion battery manufacturing value chain. Europe and the US are planning to ramp up their manufacturing capabilities significantly. India has also taken initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme to scale up domestic battery storage manufacturing. However, total domestic capacity will be minuscule when compared globally and such facilities will take at least 2-3 years to start production. It is also important to note that India does not have known deposits of minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and vanadium, which are critical for many battery technologies. Long-term reliable access to mines and the development of a battery recycling industry will be crucial. A few years ago India set up Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL) to secure critical minerals from overseas. Additional financial support will help KABIL better understand the global critical mineral value chain and hire/train manpower to secure those.Finally, the central government must increase the budget for technological development of energy storage systems. Deployment of technologies like advanced lead acid, lithium-ion, flow batteries and pumped-hydro will increase in the coming years. But energy storage innovations are currently concentrated in a few countries. Without access to technology or domestic manufacturing, India will increase its dependence on imports. For India to become a technology leader, our academia and renewable energy industry will have to engage proactively with global institutions through bilateral or multilateral innovation platforms. Indian researchers can find a niche by improving on existing batteries or focusing on alternatives like metal-air and sodium-ion batteries. While the government can facilitate global partnerships, private companies need to invest in energy storage R&D. The world is actively looking to diversify their supply chains and it is an opportunity for both the government and private players to exploit, which will help us become aatmanirbhar.As India takes the leadership of G20, it\u2019s an opportunity to showcase India\u2019s leadership in scaling up energy storage for power grid decarbonisation.Rishabh Jain is a Senior Programme Lead and Dhruv Warrior is a Research Analyst at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), an independent, not-for-profit research institution.",

        "articleBody": "India is working on a policy to classify economic activities and technologies into sustainable and non-sustainable categories to help investors looking for green projects, three government officials say. Under the proposal, similar to the Green Taxonomy pioneered by the European Union (EU), the government will certify sustainable activities, which it hopes will attract more funds and give investors an extra layer of comfort, said the three government officials, who did not want to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media. The renewable energy ministry and the finance ministry are working on the draft policy. Neither ministry responded to queries from Reuters. The officials said the draft framework is the first step in a long process of identifying sustainable projects and phasing out others. The European Union and South Africa have created taxonomies that help make green activities visible and unlock large-scale capital, some supporters of the policy say, while critics say it is  greenwashing  - concealing environmentally unfriendly activity with buzzwords and public relations. The EU also places green investment disclosure obligations on financial companies, pension funds, companies and financial market participants. India does not plan to make such disclosures compulsory for companies yet, but will deem it a best practice, one of the officials said. India projects $10 trillion to $15 trillion in investment is needed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, in alignment with its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). According to another of the officials, India will need $3 trillion in investment to hit that number, for which it is taking steps that include incentives for manufacturing hydrogen fuel, electric cars and solar panels. International bond markets are likely to contribute a small portion of the financing, but the rest will be funded through global fund managers investing locally, the second official said. Last week, India sold its first sovereign green bonds worth a total of 80 billion rupees, at yields below comparable government bonds.",

        "articleBody": "The need for energy security has never been more urgent. Ramping up renewable energy generation, energy diversification and increasing energy storage are global priorities amid heightened geopolitical tensions, climate change and soaring fossil fuel prices. These issues were the highlights at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) held in November 2022 to resolve the said challenges. India too is committed to achieving the common goal and has made a series of announcements such as reaching 500GW non-fossil energy capacity by 2030 and 50 percent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030 and so on. Therefore, Thrust is on renewable energy, which will reduce India\u2019s dependency on imported fuel and assist in achieving decarbonization and addressing climate change issues. Initiatives such as Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill, 2022, Offshore wind projects are some of the initiatives which move towards achieving said targets. The recent announcement by the government under the Hydrogen mission is a positive step in the right direction under which it is envisaged that India could attract investments worth ~USD100 billion by 2030.Historic data suggests that installed renewable energy capacity has increased to 396% in the last 8.5 years, and India has achieved ~166GW of renewable energy capacity till October 2022. India will need ~USD2.5 trillion worth of investment by 2030 to fulfil updated commitments at COP26. Moreover, India needs more than USD10 trillion to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. In India, there are a handful of organizations in the renewable energy sector. Therefore, the focus should be on robust policy, a stable tax regime, and fiscal incentives to attract investments in the sector. Globally, countries have taken serious measures such as the USA shall permit tax credit of up to USD3 per kg for 10 years which will result in cheap production of hydrogen; the UK is planning reforms to slash approval time for offshore wind from four years to one year; Brazil is considering a draft bill to fill the regulatory gaps that investors believe have slowed the renewable potential; Indonesia has issued regulations including fiscal incentives to encourage renewable energy investment. Similarly, India could consider certain initiatives illustratively discussed hereunder:As a direct tax incentive, the current concessional tax regime of 15 percent which is available to organizations commencing the generation of electricity or manufacture/production of any article or thing before 31 March 2024 should be extended to encourage organizations to invest in new energy. Further, developing indigenous technology or technical collaborations is critical to producing renewable energy. Creating a tax incentive policy towards R&D expenditure incurred by organizations for the development of such technology either indigenous or acquired from overseas jurisdiction could be considered. As an indirect tax incentive, reimbursement of indirect taxes on account of non-creditable inputs could be considered to minimize tax leakage. As prevalent in the European markets, the introduction of the carbon tax linked to carbon emissions could be evaluated. Although India currently levies taxes/ duties on fossil fuels such as coal, petrol, and diesel, though not linked to carbon emissions. This could encourage decarbonization and move towards green energy. It will also facilitate exporters' claim credit of such taxes in other countries that are levying taxes on cross-border transactions such as the Cross Border Adjustment Mechanism in Europe.From a policy standpoint, currently, PLI incentives are available for organizations engaged in manufacturing high-efficiency solar PV modules, including the upstage vertical components like cells, wafers, ingots, and polysilicon; however, no such incentives are available for organizations operating in wind or green hydrogen/ammonia sector. Offshore wind projects are going to be undertaken for the first time within the country. Given the above, the government could consider rolling out incentives in form of a PLI scheme also in the wind, green hydrogen/ ammonia sector. For developers of wind projects, investment-based incentives such as capital subsidies could be considered. To help push through the energy transition goals of the government, it is expected that the government will establish a domestic carbon market that will enable domestic organizations to trade carbon credits efficiently as against exporting carbon credits. This economic incentive is expected to reduce 1 BT of carbon by 2030 and assist in achieving net zero by 2070. The government over the years has announced its Budget over certain themes or schemes which are strategic to nation building. Given the importance of new energy, a roadmap of tax incentives and a progressive policy framework is a much-awaited need of the hour to catapult India towards its global commitment (One Earth - One Family - One Future).(Neetu Vinayek is a Partner \u2013 Infrastructure Tax Leader, EY India.

        "articleBody": "In the year 2000, ninety-nine per cent of Delhi\u2019s local traffic was borne by buses (62 per cent) and personal vehicles (37 per cent). Railways catered to a measly one per cent. Two years later, the city\u2019s mobility found a new pipeline. The first corridor of the Delhi Metro - the 8.2-kilometre section of the red line between Shahdara and Tis Hazari - was inaugurated in December 2002. The Delhi Metro completed twenty years of operations last month. Far beyond public imagination at its inception, it presently boasts an impressive 12 lines, spanning 391 kilometres of network length across 286 stations.The construction of metro rails in response to growing cities has implications beyond physicality. They create an ecosystem with many positive externalities by means of the new interactions they foster and the connections they enable. The Delhi Metro has contributed to reducing road congestion, accidents, and vehicular and noise pollution. The DMRC was estimated to have helped remove over five lakh vehicles from the streets every day in 2021. In addition, it is the first railway project in the world to claim carbon credits for using braking technology to produce energy.The Delhi Metro has connected hitherto isolated regions enabling a dispersion of urban sprawl and the emergence of new economic activity hubs. The Energy Research Institute (TERI) estimates that the metro will save passengers an annual 572.5 million hours in 2031. Reliable public transit infrastructure eliminates precarity in daily lives; people know when and how they can reach their workplace, and that they can reach it at all, along with the guarantee of minimum disruptions to this routine. This certainty is all the more valuable for women, who are assured that the vehicle will follow a standard route as opposed to the anxieties of an auto ride where they must constantly beware of suspicious detours.Notwithstanding these positive spill-overs, public mobility is hardly unaffected by the pandemic-induced lockdowns; the Delhi Metro experienced reduced ridership to 8.78 lakhs in FY 2020-21 from 27.8 lakhs in 2019-20. The DMRC recorded a total comprehensive loss of Rs. 3808.63/- crore in March 2022. Rivalling the competitive financing models of shared rides and taxi services that make door-to-door journeys and hence deliver higher convenience is also a challenge. As the Delhi Metro gradually regains its pre-pandemic ridership levels, last-mile connectivity remains a key area that can determine its future attractiveness.Many economies are transitioning to e-mobility to decarbonise their transport sectors, achieve national energy security, and promote long-term sustainability in accordance with global climate goals. Petrol and diesel-run vehicles adversely affect public health due to their toxic emissions and are less effective at energy conversion. This effect is especially worrisome in a city like Delhi, which consistently ranks amongst the most polluted cities in the world. At the same time, however, electric vehicles (EVs) come with a capital cost premium \u2013 buying them is significantly more expensive than purchasing alternatives. Delhi and India\u2019s wider income disparity makes it a significant bottleneck requiring consideration. Green infrastructure can be viable for the masses in India only if it is economically viable. Consequently, prioritising electrification of public transport before turning policy focus on private vehicles can act as a pivot to enable India\u2019s energy transition. The benefit of using EVs lies in their long-term operating costs. Mass transit can unlock an advantage of economies of scale; the most use-intensive vehicles will pose a favourable financial balance while also facilitating a paradigm shift in charging infrastructure, eventually making the EV transition smoother for individual users if public charging points are already accessible. Due to varying considerations and qualities, some vehicle types are more favourable for a transition than others. The World Bank posits that India has a strong case for adopting 2W electric motorbikes, which would generate a life-cycle cost advantage of over 40 per cent in financial terms. The argument for electric buses is only moderately supported. However, both 2Ws and buses are able to reduce negative externalities, such as environmental and air quality concerns, by close to 20 per cent. Buses significantly impact local externalities, making them appealing to Delhi\u2019s case. 4Ws do not yield an important economic advantage still.There is a strong case for an aggregated procurement strategy when it comes to electric buses. The joint-venture model of the DMRC supports this structure and can enable effective risk-sharing and mitigation across the different levels of government and the private sector. The DMRC recently returned nearly a hundred electric feeder buses to the Delhi Government, stating they were underutilised and accruing costs. This points to the need for a macro and multistakeholder perspective on urban planning, where the last-mile connecting vehicles are not only feeders but their longer routes superimposed in a way where they are readily available near metro stations. Delhi ranked 11th as the most congested city in the world in 2021. Undoubtedly, the city does not need more cars on its roads. With an integrated and multimodal approach to mass transit systems, middle and lower-income groups who cannot yet afford EVs can still benefit from their reduced operating costs. As last-mile connectivity becomes cheaper, public transport becomes more attractive. Given the positive social and environmental spill-overs that the Delhi Metro generated over the past twenty years, it is pivotal that the imagined electric transportation fleet works in tandem with the existing mass transit infrastructure - not compete with it.Amit Kapoor is chair, Institute for Competitiveness and faculty at Stanford University.

        "articleBody": "The Union government will give an additional Rs 2,000 crore to states under the Special Assistance for Capital Investment scheme to incentivise them to scrap old vehicles and also provide tax concessions to individuals for it. The government in 2022-23 Budget had introduced the 'Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment' scheme with an outlay of Rs 1.05 lakh crore. Under the scheme, financial assistance is being provided to state governments in the form of 50-year interest free loan for capital projects.  Now, the Centre has earmarked an additional Rs 2,000 crore under the scheme to encourage states to scrap condemned government vehicles or those vehicles which are older than 15 years, besides providing tax concessions to individuals for scrapping old vehicles.  In a letter to states last month, the finance ministry said that a new sector road transport has been identified for providing incentive tied to prescribed reforms by states under the scheme.  Incentive for scrapping of old vehicles has been added to the scheme and an amount of Rs 2,000 crore has been earmarked for scrapping state government vehicles which are older than 15 years, waiver of liabilities on old vehicles and providing tax concessions to individuals for scrapping of old vehicles.  With the inclusion of road transport sector, the total outlay under the scheme has increased to Rs 1.07 lakh crore, from Rs 1.05 lakh crore announced in the Budget.  So far, the government has approved Rs 77,110 crore under the scheme, out of which Rs 41,118 crore has been released to states.  The scheme aims to encourage states to undertake capital expenditure and has earmarked Rs 80,000 crore for it. Besides, states are encouraged to push reforms like privatisation or disinvestment, digitisation, urban reforms, optical fibre cable projects and building rural roads.",

        "articleBody": "The Centre has begun identifying public sector undertakings (PSUs) operating in carbon-intensive sectors that can be initiated into joining the 'First Movers Coalition' to usher in new decarbonisation technology.This week the Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) wrote to stakeholder ministries to  identify PSUs  and points of contact to  take forward the initiative , ET has learnt.This means such PSUs would commit to sourcing a certain proportion of their material requirement/technology from near zero to zero carbon suppliers/value chain participants.The seven 'hard to abate' sectors identified under the First Movers Coalition - sectors that account for 30% of global emissions - are aluminium, aviation, chemicals, concrete, shipping, steel and trucking. These sectors have been chosen because their decarbonisation is essential for the planet to achieve the 1.5-degree temperature goal. But their transition to a low-carbon technology is challenging given significant price differential and commercial scalability gap.Accordingly, communication was sent out on January 9 to the ministries of steel, chemicals and fertilisers and mines, among others. ET has learnt that the parent ministries will now write to top PSUs on the issue, nudging them to join the coalition.The 'First Movers Coalition' (FMC) is a World Economic Forum initiative co-launched with US President Joe Biden at the COP26 as a public-private partnership mission to 'clean up' sectors with high carbon emissions.Several nations, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Japan, Italy, Singapore and India, and 50 global corporations are part of the coalition. The countries have resolved to help create new and early markets for 'clean technology' to replace carbon heavy ones and back them with both policy and private sector engagement.India has also been in the steering committee of FMC since its inception. The commerce minister is on the advisory board of FMC and the Confederation of Indian Industry is the Indian industry partner for the initiative. CII has written to 45 companies and some of them are learnt to have given in principle approval for their participation in the coalition.DPIIT pointed out that to  jump start  the market, FMC members must commit to purchasing a proportion of the industrial materials and long-distance transportation from only suppliers who use near zero to zero-carbon solutions, despite the premium cost. In addition, the FMC members must also pledge to work towards addressing roadblocks and ensure that low-carbon technologies are in place on a commercial scale by 2030 so that 2050 net zero goal can be achieved.",

The Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas also said that oil marketing companies (OMCs) have been directed to prepare a plan in the field of green hydrogen, which he said will be submitted to the Prime Minister's Office very soon.  The minister made the remarks while addressing reporters on the sidelines of '11th CII Bio-Energy Summit' in the national capital.   I have always been a staunch believer that the success of green hydrogen will come from the petroleum and natural gas (PNG) sector for a variety of reasons (like) you have refineries which will produce and consume green hydrogen for a variety of PNG functions,  he said.  On January 4, the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore to make India a global hub for the manufacturing of this clean source of energy.  The mission seeks to promote the development of a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT (Million Metric Tonnes) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.  Puri further said that he recently called a meeting of OMCs with regard to developing a road map for the production of green hydrogen.   I called my oil companies and said I want to be the first minister to submit to the PM (Narendra Modi) a plan on how these OMCs are going to deal with green hydrogen. I am very happy to announce that we will submit a plan very soon,   he said.  All of them are looking to transition towards green hydrogen in a very comprehensive way, Puri said without naming any company.",

        "articleBody": "The centre is working on a policy for setting up ethanol pumps in the country to speed up the adoption of clean energy and wean away from polluting fossil fuels. Speaking at a Bio-Energy Summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari said, \u201cI will be meeting the Petroleum Minister in 15 days to make a policy for setting up ethanol pumps in the country.\u201d\u201cThe potential of ethanol is huge and there is a demand from Bangladesh for it as well,\u201d he added.Gadkari said that there is a requirement of 1000 crore litre of ethanol if we blend it with petrol by up to 20%. \u201cNow Bajaj, Hero, and TVS have motorcycles ready that can run on 100% bioethanol. We can also have auto rickshaws that run on it,\u201d he said.India has been pushing for replacing fossil fuel run vehicles with alternate fuels in a bid to cut import dependence and boost local manufacturing. According to Gadkari, the country\u2019s Rs 16 lakh crore fuel import bill is a challenge that needs to be addressed.Commenting on the status of ethanol dispensation outlets that have been set up, he said, \u201cWe have three ethanol pumps in Pune but we now need scooters and rickshaws to run on flex fuel and coordinate with the pumps. This can be spread to Uttar Pradesh and all scooters and auto rickshaw can run on bio-ethanol in the state.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "All 7,000 electric buses under the FAME-II scheme are expected to ply in different cities of the country in the next one year, a senior official of the Heavy Industries ministry said on Thursday. Out of the 7,000 electric buses under the FAME-II scheme, over 3,000 e-buses are already operating in the country.  In 2019, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Phase II (FAME India Phase II) scheme for promotion of electric mobility in the country was approved.  Through the scheme, it is planned to support 10 lakh e-two-wheelers, 5 lakh e-three-wheelers, 55,000 four-wheelers and 7,000 e-buses.  Joint Secretary in the ministry Hanif Qureshi said that the government is taking steps to promote growth of the industry and for faster adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the country.   Electric mobility is an important part to reduce carbon emissions. The government has launched schemes to promote EVs... FAME is a demand (driven) incentive scheme... 7,000 buses so far incentives under the scheme.   I hope in the next one year it will be on the road. We have more plans to incentivise buses,  he said at the ongoing Auto Expo 2023.  He also said that the government has rolled out a production-linked incentive scheme for manufacturing of advanced cell chemistry batteries to strengthen the EV ecosystem of the country.  Speaking on the subject, Adviser (Infrastructure Connectivity - Transport and Electric Mobility) Sudhendu Sinha pitched for the quality of batteries to promote electric vehicles in the country.",

        "articleBody": "India's green hydrogen industry faces a challenge from the huge subsidies being given by some developed countries, power and renewable energy minister RK Singh said a day after the government announced a \u20b919,744 crore plan to spur local production. Singh said India can supply green hydrogen and green ammonia at prices less than what other countries can offer. Now the only requirement we have from the developed world is to let the procurement of green hydrogen and green ammonia on a competitive basis,  Singh said speaking with the media after an interaction with stakeholders on Thursday.He said these subsidies could be questioned.  We believe it to be a trade-distorting step which I think is actionable under the WTO rules,  he said at a press conference on Thursday.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a green hydrogen mission aimed at bolstering manufacturing of electrolysers and green hydrogen.The government believes the green hydrogen mission can position India to export green hydrogen and green ammonia. We can produce green energy at very competitive rates. Now we can supply green ammonia and green hydrogen at prices that are less than what other countries can offer,  Singh said.The government's idea of coming out as the most competitive source of green hydrogen and green ammonia hinges on first-mover advantage and the scale of production. The world is looking for hydrogen to address these issues [carbon emissions]. We aim to emerge as the biggest providers of green hydrogen and green ammonia,  Singh added.For manufacturing of electrolysers, which is also a part of the green hydrogen mission, the government will be introducing a production-linked incentive scheme.The government expects electrolyser manufacturing capacities in India to come up by FY26 and until then there will not be any customs duty on its import.On the issue of the mandated use of green hydrogen, Singh said it was being discussed earlier when grey or traditional hydrogen prices were cheaper than green hydrogen.Norms and standardsThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy will come out with detailed guidelines and standards for making India a global hub for hydrogen manufacturing.  We will come out with a detailed order after clearance by the Cabinet,  Singh told the media.The hydrogen mission is expected to attract \u20b98 lakh crore of investment and create 600,000 new jobs.",

        "articleBody": "Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd., will be focusing his attention on the Indian conglomerate\u2019s pivot to green energy, according to people familiar with the matter, after putting his children in charge of other businesses. The 65-year-old will oversee strategy, including the building of gigafactories and blue hydrogen facilities, will assess acquisition targets, and is talking to potential investors, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn\u2019t public. Ambani last year unveiled plans to spend $75 billion on clean energy projects over the next 15 years. Asia\u2019s second-richest man is known for his single-minded focus on key pursuits: In the 1990s he lived for months in shipping containers to build what is today the world\u2019s largest petrochemical refinery and about two decades later another of his upstart firms became India\u2019s biggest telecom operator. Ambani has since handed the operational reins to his three children and turned his attention to green energy, which will see him go head-to-head with the region\u2019s wealthiest person, Gautam Adani.A spokesman for Reliance didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.Reliance is seeking billions of dollars of investments in India\u2019s energy sector and has approached potential investors including Middle Eastern funds, two of the people said. His ambition is to disrupt the sector just like he did with his mobile phone company Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., one of the people said, adding that the billionaire and his team were telling marquee investors they would own own every link of the renewables supply chain that can enhance margins. Ambani\u2019s dealmaking acumen will be crucial. Reliance spent almost $50 billion to build Reliance Jio, which became India\u2019s No. 1 wireless carrier within some three years of its 2016 debut by offering free calls and cheap data. Then, over a few months of the pandemic lockdown in 2020, Ambani raised more than $20 billion for his digital ventures from a slew of investors including Silicon Valley giants, Meta Platforms Inc. and Google.Reliance, with a market value of $206 billion, has a 2035 target for turning carbon net-zero. India\u2019s transition from fossil fuels to renewables will provide an opportunity for Reliance\u2019s continuous \u201chyper-growth\u201d over many decades, Ambani told shareholders last August. Adani, on his part, has committed $70 billion to become the world\u2019s largest renewables player. Ambani\u2019s focus on clean energy comes after he spent much of last year establishing his children at his empire\u2019s other businesses. Eldest son Akash Ambani was named chairman of Reliance Jio, twin sister Isha Ambani will oversee Reliance\u2019s retail operations and youngest Anant Ambani will be looking after the energy unit. ",

Meanwhile, Rs 1,466 crore will be used to conduct pilot projects. The R&D component is likely to receive an investment of Rs 800 crore. The mission will be use to development infrastructure under PM Gati Shakti scheme, said Thakur. Green Hydrogen Hub will be developed to bring buyers and producers under one roof,  he said. Under this mission, the government aims to raise annual green hydrogen production to 5 million tonnes, renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 gigawatts, attract over Rs 8 lakh crore in investments, lakhs of jobs, and most importantly over Rs 1 lakh crore cumulative reduction of fossil fuel imports.The mission is expected to help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50 million tonnes.In the Budget Speech 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to launch a National Hydrogen Mission for generating hydrogen from green power sources.Hydrogen, like electricity, is an energy carrier that must be produced from another substance. Hydrogen can be produced--separated--from a variety of sources including water, fossil fuels, or biomass and used as a source of energy or fuel.India has a huge edge in green hydrogen production owing to its favourable geographic conditions and the presence of abundant natural elements.In his Independence Day speech on August 15, 2021, Hon'ble Prime Minister announced the launch of National Hydrogen Mission. Of every effort being made by India today, the thing that is going to help India with a quantum leap in terms of climate is the field of Green Hydrogen. To achieve the goal of Green Hydrogen, I am announcing the National Hydrogen Mission today with this tricolour as a witness,  Prime Minister Modi had said from the Red Fort.(With inputs from agencies)",

        "articleBody": "India has set ambitious climate targets as part of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to tackle the climate crisis. These include short- and long-term measures such as reducing the emissions intensity by 45%, installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity, and achieving a net-zero economy by 2070. An important step in this direction is the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill 2022, which was passed in the Rajya Sabha recently. The Bill addresses several energy efficiency and decarbonisation measures across the economy. These include a non-fossil-fuel mandate for designated consumers (the largest consumers of energy), the setting up of a carbon credit trading scheme, the inclusion of residential buildings in the new Energy Conservation and Sustainable Building Code, and increasing the purview of energy consumption standards to include vehicles and industrial units. Another important enabling measure in the Bill is the decision to expand the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) governing council, with representatives from greater parts of the economy.Implications of the BillIf one takes a closer look at some of the measures in the Bill, it is interesting to observe the dual focus on deepening existing decarbonisation measures in India\u2019s energy-intensive sectors and bringing greater parts of the Indian economy under energy efficiency actions.Industries are the biggest consumers of energy in India, with almost 40% share of the final energy consumption primarily consisting of fossil fuels. The Government has taken steps in the past to reduce fossil fuel consumption, including the Perform Achieve Trade (PAT) scheme. The PAT scheme focuses on designated consumers from industrial subsectors (e.g., steel, aluminium, textiles) and other energy-intensive sectors such as distribution utilities and thermal power plants. It mandates energy savings targets for these designated consumers and uses a cap-and-trade scheme of Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts). The second PAT cycle (from 2016 to 2019) had 621 such designated consumers, covering 30% of India\u2019s energy consumption, which resulted in emissions savings of over 60 million tonnes of CO2.Mandating non-fossil fuel usage for designated consumers is an important measure in the Bill that increases the depth of decarbonisation measures. The total energy consumption of this category in the second PAT cycle was 244 million tonnes of oil equivalent. Approximately, 15% of this energy use is in the form of electricity, around 430 terawatt-hours. Assuming that the renewable electricity mandates in the Bill are similar to the Renewable Power Obligations prescribed to DISCOMs for 2022\u201323, this would translate to a demand for almost 70 GW of solar capacity. Beyond the direct effect on decarbonisation, this high quantum of demand can drive the growth of the renewables market and bring down costs further. The second important measure is the introduction of a carbon credit scheme. The Government (or an agency authorised by it) is now allowed to issue carbon credit certificates to units that comply with the scheme. Importantly, energy savings or carbon credits can now be bought on a voluntary basis, opening additional financing for clean technologies. The export of excess carbon credits will be allowed, but the Government\u2019s primary focus will be on using the carbon market to meet the country\u2019s NDCs.The Bill has also made additions to Energy Consumption Standards (motors, vessels, industrial units) and the Energy Conservation and Sustainable Building Code (residential buildings). These are important additions as residential buildings are among the fastest-growing sources of energy consumption, fuelled by the growing usage of appliances and increased space-cooling requirements. In 2030, an estimated 70% of the building sector\u2019s electricity consumption is set to come from residential buildings. Bringing it under the fold of energy efficiency schemes immediately is a crucial step in preventing the overall energy demand from skyrocketing. Questions remainWhile focusing on non-fossil fuel mandates, it is important to reiterate that the average electricity consumption in industries is still a fraction (15%) of the total energy consumption, the rest being in the form of thermal energy. The energy demand cannot directly be substituted through renewables alone. Electrification of heating processes and the use of cleaner fuels (biomass, biogas, green ammonia, green hydrogen, etc.) exist, and their growth is expected with market mechanisms such as the carbon credit scheme. More supply-side interventions are required to disseminate these technologies at scale and meet the non-fossil fuel mandates. More details are also required on the carbon credit scheme. A 2021 draft blueprint by BEE on Voluntary Carbon Markets is expected to act as a framework, but further decisions are required on market regulators, governance structures, monitoring and verification protocols, and so on. Much also depends on the emissions savings targets and the penalties imposed on participating units; the market design is key in adequately incentivising polluters to invest in clean technology. In the long term, the carbon credit scheme should also look beyond the energy sector. Processes such as land-use change and forestry can help maximise the decarbonisation potential of these market-based measures. While the inclusion of residential buildings is a welcome step towards energy efficiency in buildings, the Bill alone cannot change the sector or be uniformly applied across the country. State governments have the flexibility to modify building codes to better fit their local requirements and climatic conditions. This flexibility must be utilised to make building codes more implementable. Power is also a concurrent subject; enforcing the Energy Conservation and Sustainable Buildings Code requires clear implementation strategies from state and local governments. Overall, the Bill takes a promising step forward by creating a legislative basis to decarbonise increasing parts of the Indian economy. With clarity on the strategy towards effective implementation, central and state governments can help transform the country\u2019s energy future.(The author works in the area of energy and power at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), a research-based think tank.)",

        "articleBody": "The power ministry is expected to soon announce a framework to facilitate setting up pumped hydro storage plants, which will boost round-the-clock electricity supply from non-fossil sources.The framework includes details identifying sites for project development, single-window clearance, and central monitoring of the projects. It is expected to be notified around the end of December or January beginning, a senior government official told ET.The move will promote renewable energy addition as pumped hydro storage will help resolve the issue of intermittent power supply from solar and wind sources, and it is cheaper than battery storage, the official said.The stored power can be sold or used in peak demand hours. Independent storage owners can even sell the capacity to renewable energy generators at a certain cost.Pumped hydro storage act like a giant battery that stores power to release it when needed. It is a two-reservoir system at different elevations. In the case a renewable project has surplus power, it can be used to pump water to the higher reservoir during the non-peak hours.When electricity is needed, water can drop through a turbine to the lower reservoir giving back the stored electricity.Renewable power generators and hydropower producers can set up pumped storage plants at existing or completely new sites like in abandoned mines.It will also help companies wanting round-the-clock non-fossil power for heavy captive consumption like in the steel and cement sectors. Such companies can set up their own pumped hydro storage plants or purchase storage facilities from those setting up. In the long run, the industries think that it [pumped hydro storage] will be cheaper. They will get the main energy from solar or wind and can mix that with the storage from PSP and the combined basket will be cheaper from what is being supplied by distribution companies after cross-subsidy,  the official said.",

        "articleBody": "Assocham president Sumant Sinha has called for bringing down interest rates for the industry, especially for the domestic renewables sector, which is seeing high rates of 8-10 per cent compared to 3-4 per cent in the western markets.  On his expectations from the government for the domestic power and renewable energy sectors in the upcoming budget, Sinha said interest rates should be brought down for the rate-sensitive sector.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the budget on February 1.   Bring down the interest rates because ours is a very interest rate-centric sector. ...it is high compared to what you pay in other parts of the world. In India, the rate is in the range of 8 per cent to 9.5 per cent for the industry and (specifically) in power and renewables (sectors) it is 8-10 per cent,  Sinha, who is also the Chairman of ReNew Power said in an interview.   In the western world, rates are 3 to 4 per cent.   Sinha said every 1 percentage point increase in the interest rate has an impact of about 15 paise on the tariff of power. So, if borrowing is cheaper, the industry could provide cheaper power to the buyers, which will have a multiplier effect down the chain.  Singh also suggested that the allocation for PLI for solar module manufacturing can be increased from Rs 19,500 crore in the Budget for FY2022-23.   In our sector what we would like to see happening is (announcement of) the green hydrogen policy, with some degree of subsidization for manufacturing of hydrogen if we have to compete at the global level. In the US, the generation cost of hydrogen is 3-4 USD and their government gives subsidies up to the same level so its is almost free,  he said.  In his Independence Day speech last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission with a view to aiding the government in meeting its climate targets and making India a green hydrogen hub.  The government can also come up with a PLI Scheme for electrolysers in the Budget, he suggested. Electrolysers are required for the production of hydrogen and the domestic availability of this equipment will boost India's plan to become a global hub of hydrogen manufacturing.  Sinha also called for a PLI scheme for setting up of wind energy capacities.   Why don't we have a PLI for wind as well? It will bring down the cost of wind also. Wind and solar are both renewable energy. I have suggested this to the government,  he said, adding that this will help bring down the cost of wind capacities which is around Rs 6 -7 crore per megawatt at present.",

Not just imports but a shift to renewables is also seen as a way to cut carbon footprint and meet net-zero targets. And so the government in 2022 aggressively pushed for the adoption of electric vehicles, the production of green hydrogen, manufacturing of solar equipment and energy storage in pursuit of its ambitious 500 GW renewable capacity target by 2030.  India would have to add at least 25GW of renewable energy capacity per annum for eight years continuously to achieve the 500 GW target by 2030.  At present, India has around 173GW of non-fossil fuel based clean energy capacity which includes about 62GW of solar, 42GW of wind energy, 10GW of biomass power, about five GW of small hydro, 47 GW of large hydro and seven GW of nuclear power capacity.  Talking to PTI, Union power and new & renewable energy minister R K Singh stated that the investment in the renewable energy sector could be around USD 25 billion in 2023.  Elaborating further he said,  We have to achieve a 500 GW target (of clean energy by 2030). Currently, we have a capacity of 173 GW (including large hydro and nuclear power). Capacity under construction is around 80 GW. It takes it to 250 GW. So we have to do another 200 GW by 2030.   He explained further that India needs to add about 25 GW of renewable energy capacity per annum for the next eight years, which would require an investment of Rs 1,25,000 crore or USD 15 billion to 16 billion factoring in Rs 5 crore requirement per MW of capacity addition.  Singh further said:  We are also doing (solar) manufacturing, which will also attract investment. Currently, a capacity worth Rs 8,780 crore is under construction. It includes polysilicon and module. We are bringing the PLI (Production Linked Incentive) scheme worth Rs 19,500 crore, under which around 40GW capacity will be developed. We are also doing offshore wind of 4GW, which will also fetch billions of dollars.   The government is also focussing on green hydrogen with its National Mission on Green Hydrogen. The bids are expected for the manufacturing of electrolysers next year. That would also bring investment in the clean energy sector.  Solar Power Developer Association (SPDA) has suggested,  Green ammonia and green hydrogen production should be included under infrastructure sector definition, then, investment in these sectors also can be made through FVCI (Foreign Venture Capital Investor) route. This will give more flexibility to foreign investors and attract investment.   In 2022, the government provided an additional allocation of Rs 19,500 crore to the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme 'National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules'. The bids are already issued this year and would be allocated in 2023.  In 2021, the government introduced the PLI with an outlay of Rs 4,500 crore to support and promote the manufacturing of high-efficiency solar photovoltaic (PV) modules.  These include the upstage vertical components like cells, wafers, ingots and polysilicon. The initiative is expected to reduce import dependence in the solar PV sector.  Gyanesh Chaudhary, Vice Chairman and Managing Director, Vikram Solar told PTI,  Investment in India's renewable energy sector grew more than 125 per cent YoY (Year on Year) to touch a record USD 14.5 billion in FY22. India has already crossed 11 GW capacity installation in the first 9 months of the year (2022-23).   He listed some of the challenges including continued solar import (80-90 per cent still imported, worth USD 3.2 billion in FY22) and expensive raw materials (50 per cent price rise in domestic panels).  He stated that the hike in shipping costs adds to module and overall project cost.  Besides, Indian rupee falling against USD will lead to exchange rate variations between bidding and finalisation of projects, he added.  He also pointed toward the lack of flexible financing solutions and lack of tax exemptions and subsidy availability for R&D (in renewable energy)   Although the challenges are there, the growth story presents a compelling argument for domestic manufacturers like Vikram Solar to focus on innovation and capacity expansion,  he added.  The government is also focussing on harnessing the potential of setting up large hydropower projects in the country. Large hydro has already been given renewable energy status like small hydro which has a capacity of up to 25MW.  Earlier this month, the government waived off ISTS (Inter-State Transmission System) or wheeling charges on the transmission of electricity generated from new hydro power projects for 18 years from the date of commissioning.  Hydro power projects, being clean, green and sustainable will be of paramount importance in India's clean energy transition journey. They are also essential for the integration of solar and wind power, which are intermittent in nature.  In acknowledgment of the inherent qualities of hydro power, the government of India declared hydro power projects as a renewable source of power in March 2019. However, waiver of inter-state transmission charges provided to solar and wind projects had not been extended to hydro power projects.  In order to remove this discrepancy and to provide a level-playing field to hydro projects, the government has now decided to extend the waiver of ISTS charges on the transmission of power from new hydropower projects, for which construction work is awarded and PPA (power purchase agreement) is signed on or before June 30, 2025.  The government has also planned an investment of over USD 30 billion or Rs 2.44 lakh crore for creating a robust transmission system commensurate with its target of achieving 500 GW of clean energy by 2030.  A high-level committee prepared a detailed plan titled 'Transmission System for Integration of over 500 GW RE Capacity by 2030' in consultation with states and other stakeholders.  The plan is a major step towards achieving the goal of integrating 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2030 by providing a broad plan of the required transmission system for having 537 GW of Renewable Energy capacity by 2030.  The planned additional transmission systems required for having 500 GW of non-fossil fuel include 8,120 ckm (circuit kilometer) of high voltage direct current transmission corridors (+800 kV and +350 kV), 25,960 ckm of 765 kV ac lines, 15,758 ckm of 400 kV lines and 1,052 ckm of 220 kV cable at an estimated cost of Rs 2.44 lakh crore.   The year 2022 has been a remarkable year for renewables and energy transition in India. While renewable energy crosses over 165 GW of installations, the cumulative SECI bids reached over 42 GW. With our vision to commission 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and net zero by 2070 at COP26, this will require a significant step up of our on-ground efforts,  said Girish Tanti, Executive Vice Chairman, Suzlon Group.  He further stated that he believes 2023 is positioned to become one of the most crucial milestones in  accelerating our energy transition journey .  Harmonizing all renewable energy policies thereby evening out the benefits and support provided to various renewable sources will be key in creating equal opportunities for all renewable sources to participate in India's energy transition, he opined.",

        "articleBody": "India is planning a stabilization fund to keep prices of credits in its planned carbon market above a certain threshold, ensuring that they remain attractive for investors and that the market succeeds in cutting emissions, two government sources said. Money in the fund would be used by a market regulator to buy carbon credits if prices fell too low, one of the officials said.  Consistent investor interest in credits and a floor under the price would be needed because sharp falls in the market could discourage industries from reducing carbon dioxide emissions, that official added. Planning envisages the market becoming fully operational in 2026, covering 37% of the country's emissions, according to slides, seen by Reuters, that the Power Ministry has shown to stakeholders. The sources said the government intended to publish the market's rules soon. Details would be announced next year, said a third person, Samrat Sengupta, vice president for new businesses and market strategy at carbon offsetter EKI Energy Ltd, which has been briefed by the government.  In creating a carbon market, a country sets a limit on emissions and then allocates a corresponding quantity of tradable permits, or credits, to emitters. The quantity reduces over time. If a company wants to emit more, it can buy more credits at the market price, but it will also consider whether constraining or even cutting its emissions might more profitable. The source said the federal government would set up the stabilization fund. Exactly how it would work and where the money would come from was still under discussion. The second source said the World Bank had shown interest in financing the carbon market if a stabilization mechanism were created. The World Bank has already said it will provide $8 million to help India prepare carbon-pricing instruments. India's Power Ministry and the World Bank did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. The plans for creating a stabilization fund and funding details have not been reported previously. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Beginning in 2008, prices of carbon credits in other countries slumped heavily, because of that year's economic crisis and because governments had issued too many of them. In the European Union, a credit worth 1 tonne of carbon dioxide traded at just 5 euros in 2012, down from around 30 euros in 2008, so cutting emissions was not very rewarding. But creation of a stabilisation fund in 2019, among other measures, has seen the price rise to between 75 and 95 euros per tonne. MARKET LANDSCAPEThe Indian market would cover emissions of carbon dioxide and also five other greenhouse gases valued in terms of their carbon dioxide equivalence, the sources said. Power Minister R.K. Singh said last week the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission would probably be the market regulator. In a part of the planned market to be called the compliance market, participation would be obligatory for entities in a dozen sectors, such as oil refining, steel, aluminium and cement, the sources said. Another part, the voluntary market, would be open to other entities. India already has a market for trading certificates in above-target energy savings. Entities in 13 sectors must participate. Green energy companies formed a group in October to mediate between the government and industry. They included Adani Green, owned by billionaire Gautam Adani, Hero Future Energies, Ayana Renewable Power and global private equity major KKR's Virescent Infra. The targets for reducing each sector's emissions will be set by committees of the environment, power and renewable energy ministries, the two officials said. India's carbon market is being set up in two phases, according to the government's presentation slides. In the first phase, between 2023 and 2025, the existing energy-savings certificates will be converted to carbon credits. The government was still considering whether the new market would subsume one in which certificates for renewable energy generation are traded, the two officials said. India has committed to cutting its ratio of greenhouse emissions to gross domestic product by 2030 to 45% of its 2005 level and to net zero by 2070.",

India is already sourcing about 42 per cent of its energy requirements from non-fossils sectors, Additional Power Secretary Ajay Tiwari said at South Asia (BBIN) Power Summit organised by industry body Confederation of Indian Industry here on Friday.  According to official data, the total installed electricity generating capacity in the country was 409 GW, including 166 GW of renewable generating capacity (including large hydro) as of October 31, 2022.   Going by the current pace and trajectory, India is likely to source about 62 per cent of its energy requirements from non-fossil sources by 2030, exceeding the target it has set for itself for sourcing about 50 per cent of energy requirements from non-fossils sources by that year,  Tiwari said.  According to the power ministry, the country's electricity generation capacity will reach 820 GW by 2030, including more than 500 GW from non-fossil fuel sources.  The senior ministry official further said that India is actively working towards a vision to have an interconnected power grid across the South Asian region covering as many countries as possible.   India has a very robust power grid running from North to South and East to West of the country. In future we would like to see the grid connected to neighbouring countries including Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and then expand that connection to Southeast Asian countries, to emerge as a unified market,  Tiwari said.  A discussion at inter-government level is already happening in this regard to strengthen the cross-border grid between India and Nepal and India and Bhutan, he said.",

        "articleBody": "One of the major drivers of the world economy these days is climate change. Increasing temperatures, tell-tale signs of abruptly changing climate and the mind-numbing forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) constitute a major force that countries around the globe are finding hard to ignore.Energy policies across nations are allotting larger shares for renewable energy that is likely to take them closer to the net zero target. At the same time planners are estimating domestic potential for energy production in the alternative mode so that their country is not threatened with a crippling energy crisis. Clearly, climate change is affecting a transition where the question of energy security looms large in the minds of governments. India, which had taken the bold step of liberalizing its economy more than three decades ago, is expecting substantial contributions from private corporations to ensure an energy-secure future.India promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070 in the COP26 summit at Glasgow in 2021. The Prime Minister also stated the country\u2019s target of harnessing 50% of required energy from renewable resources by 2030 and reducing total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by the same year.Against the backdrop of this announcement the current energy scenario in India will make an interesting reading. As per the information shared on the website of the Ministry of Power, Government of India, updated till mid-October 2022, the total share of fossil fuels in our energy generation is 57.9 percent. Renewables, in contrast, contribute 29 percent. The share of renewables has increased sharply in the past decade, the increment being dominated by solar power. Yet the dependence on coal which still has a share of 50 percent will be really difficult to do away with.A few encouraging signs, however, of eagerness to tackle the concerned challenge are visible on the corporate front. Frontrunning private producers of coal-based power in the country have sensed the global mood and are undertaking course correction measures. Those have already announced big targets for renewable energy generation in keeping with the national goal.However, there is a disturbing fault line in the concerned landscape. India continues to import most of its components of renewable setups from abroad. The heavy dependence on imports does not augur well for a future that is expected to be fully served by renewables. In fact, close to eighty percent of our solar imports are from China. A 2016 rule of the World Trade Organization puts a bar on the quantity of domestic production of required solar panels etc and thereby forces the country to allow imports. In spite of this restraint the fact remains that our private sector has not proven its capacity to manufacture the required components with cost competitiveness.The situation can be changed in several ways, one of those being appropriate investments in technological upgradation. Tough decisions on the part of management and adequate infrastructural support from the government are prerequisites for substantial investments in R&D. A few corporations with deep pockets are trying the easier way of acquiring reputed manufacturing corporations abroad. It remains to be seen whether such measures are effective in ensuring energy-security.Nuclear power is another area where larger participation of private corporations is needed. While companies are involved in construction and manufacturing of machine parts for nuclear power plants, none owns such a plant. The public sector continues to dominate this sector. Recent reforms in atomic energy policy have definitely encouraged the private players but those need to be more exhaustive to alter the ownership scenario. The substitution of import of uranium is an issue of major concern here. The existing mines in Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh are unable to supply the mineral in adequate quantity and thus the country has gone for import of natural uranium from Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, France, and Canada. The situation can be improved by conducting large scale mineral prospecting within our national boundary. This can be done effectively by taking advantage of the healthy start-up ecosystem. The focus on using financially viable local uranium resources can be profitably integrated into the policy of Atmanirbhar Bharat.The scale of transition in energy production required in India is staggering. This large country with a huge population needs much more than a few examples of clean and green energy production. Many players from the private sector are needed if we are to transform the energy scenario to meet our goals. It is imperative that cooperation should replace all acrimony in the relationship between government and private corporations if we are to formulate a sound energy security policy.(The writer, Dr Prateek Kanakia is founder, TheGreenBillions, which specialises in consulting, managing and executing sustainable initiatives)Disclaimer: views expressed above are the author\u2019s own",

        "articleBody": "Montreal: How world leaders address climate change and biodiversity loss is closely tied to the future of the planet and of young people, yet their voices are not articulated properly in the decisions pertaining to issues that will likely affect them more than any other group.  As 196 countries chalk out a post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) during the COP15 conference here - a process that began at the UN Biodiversity Conference four years ago in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt -- there has been a sustained push for the inclusion of youth, women, and gender minorities in determining the targets to address biodiversity loss, and how they will be implemented.  In the Convention on Biological Diversity process, Parties have consulted with non-state actors such as the Women's Caucus, International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity, and the Global Youth Biodiversity Network (GYBN), stated Basile van Havre, Co-Chair for the CBD's Post-2020 Open Ended Working Group here.  A UNESCO  World in 2030  Survey Report published last year highlighted concerns of the youth over climate change and biodiversity loss.  The report shows that climate change and loss of biodiversity was by far the most-selected challenge, chosen by 67 per cent of the 15,000 respondents.  Young delegates believe creating more space for youth perspectives is essential to successfully conserving biodiversity, securing marginalised communities' access to biodiversity, and their rights to benefit from the sustainable use of that biodiversity.  They maintain that an inclusive, rights-based approach is key to delivering sound public policy for generations to come as countries commit to conserving land and water resources and reversing biodiversity loss.   The rights of nature and humans are an integral aspect of nature conservation, especially in India where we have communities living close to protected areas and regions. Therefore explicit references to human and nature rights along with right-based approaches to conservation are critical for the proper implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) at COP15,  says youth delegate Shruthi Kottillil, who is part of GYBN.   The Indian youth make up almost 30 per cent of our national population. It's our future that is being discussed at the COP15,  says Pakhi Das, a youth delegate at COP15 and National Coordinator of the Indian Biodiversity Youth Network.   As well-informed, experienced stakeholders that represent a diversity of expertise and unique perspectives, it is very important our opinions are solicited and voices heard at all levels of governance,  Das told PTI.  Das believes the youth not only have fresh ideas but also the capacity to innovate and simplify complex issues, which according to her, could go a long way in achieving the targets India is committing to.  Sudha Kottillil, Shruthi's sister, is also a youth delegate attending the COP15 conference as part of GYBN. She says the Indian youth are demanding a transformative system-wide change at COP15.   A focus on -- and explicit mention of -- transformative education in the global biodiversity framework would help all governments to take note of it and start implementing to create that much-needed change that everyone wants,  Kottillil said.  Das, Kottillil, and their peers want governments to facilitate funding for youth to participate in future events linked to biodiversity - and to ensure that the GBF, once adopted in Montreal, is implemented by Parties in a participatory and inclusive way   Implementation will be the next key step where concrete actions will need to be taken and it can't be done without recognising the rights of nature and humans,  Shruthi told PTI.   We have created a youth action plan for the implementation of the GBF once adopted and presented a draft version to the Indian delegates,  Das added.   Our ideas have been very well received and we are very optimistic that we will be able to work with the government soon,  she added.  In an effort to amplify young voices at COP15, Charlotte can't Klooster, Scientific Advisor of Reserva: The Youth Land Trust, a US-based non-profit handed over 140 letters, written by young Indian children, to National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) Secretary, Justin Mohan, who's one of the lead negotiators from the country.  One of the letters by six-year-old Anaya from Chennai reads:  Dear Grownups, Thank you for reading my thoughts. I learned that the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, and the safety of our soil are all dependent on Trees. Are they not our gift boxes from God?! Please do not unwrap them all. Please keep them for us. We like to breathe fresh air, drink clean water, and live safely...    Children and young people have been sitting in their bedrooms and classrooms drawing and writing about their hopes for nature. Now we're sending their message to governments here in Canada,  Callie Broaddus, Founder, and Director of Reserva said. Ragini Sarma, who is a part of a youth delegation in Montreal, wants world leaders to stick to the promises that they are making in Montreal.   As for world leaders, particularly India, I want them to address how they will incorporate indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) in the 30X30 target, if the plan is to make 30 per cent of land protected, I would like them to assure that the indigenous rights of these lands are maintained and not displaced,  Sarma said.  Sarma hopes the parties will incorporate not just academic scientific knowledge behind each target, but also recognise the value of traditional knowledge of IPLCs.   I hope for it to be as mainstream as scientific reporting is. Traditional knowledge is just as effective, if not more, to halt this rate of the large rate of species loss and ecosystem loss,  she added  The forest ecology student also wants businesses to report their impacts on biodiversity, which is currently noted in Target 15 of the draft text of the Framework.   Businesses now are required to report on their sustainable footprints, but it is only mandatory for the climate. I want this to exist not just for climate, but for ecosystems and nature as well,  she added.  Of the many heated topics of discussion at the summit have been the regulation of gene drives, living modified organisms, and synthetic biology. Here too, young delegates want their voices heard.  As a young researcher attending COP15 representing the iGEM Foundation, a non-profit promoting synthetic biology, Shreya Kulkarni wants COP15 to open doors for more innovation and research in responsible Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology (SynBio), a set of concepts, approaches, and tools that enable the modification or creation of biological organisms.   SynBio has the potential to bring in novel and creative solutions to urgent global problems like hunger, energy, and vector-borne diseases along with climate change, biodiversity loss, and conservation,  Kulkarni said.   I believe that responsible application of these new technologies can help restore our planet and conserve biodiversity,  she added.   Definitely, we have been working alongside youth and giving them a voice, meeting with them here. I can see parties calling on the youth like they call on scientists and indigenous people,  notes Co-Chair van Havre.",

        "articleBody": "India could attract close to $10 billion in renewable energy investment in 2023, a bright spot as public markets remain largely shut to big-ticket capital raising, according to Bank of America Corp.\u2019s top executives in the country.Deals and investments will continue to flow into areas such as electric vehicles and green hydrogen, Kaku Nakhate, the lender\u2019s president and India country head, said in an interview, as investors look to reflect the energy transition in their portfolios. \u201cIf you really have to get your ESG story right, and if you are into energy, then you can do large pieces of work in India,\u201d Nakhate said.Sectors such as renewable energy and retail are set to benefit as India pulls ahead of emerging market rivals in attracting overseas investors. Even as dealmaking globally has been hit by rising interest rates and market volatility, the South Asian nation\u2019s geopolitical stability helps position it for greater inflows.Investors and companies attending the bank\u2019s recent North American roadshow were impressed by the Indian government\u2019s clear targets to achieve net zero carbon, Nakhate said. \u201cPeople take us seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are seeing more sustainability funds that want to invest in India.\u201dThe bank will continue to build out its distressed debt financing business in the renewable energy sector, which has generated double-digit returns, she said.Along with green investment, Nakhate predicts an increase in dealmaking in consumer brands, which are supported by rising per capita income and spending.\u201cIf you want to play the India story, you will want a mix of brands to enjoy the distribution story,\u201d Nakhate said.The bank also expects India to benefit from so-called friend-shoring by companies that are rethinking their supply chains, disrupted by Covid and the Ukraine war, Nakhate said. India, with its democratic traditions and robust domestic markets, is well suited to attract this capital, Nakhate said.IPO Challenges The optimism is offset by the picture in initial public offerings. Though first-time share sale volumes plunged globally in the year to date, India\u2019s decline of nearly 60% versus the same period in 2021 outpaced the worldwide slump, data complied by Bloomberg show.Bank of America doesn\u2019t plan to make significant hires in the coming year in India, Nakhate said, as investment banks worldwide have cut back on staff and bonuses. A local exception is Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.\u2019s investment banking arm, which is planning to hire about 20 bankers as it bets on a rebound in deals activity next year, Chief Executive Officer S Ramesh told Bloomberg News in an interview last month.Large IPOs of $1 billion or more likely won\u2019t return until the end of 2023 or into 2024, according to Subhrajit Roy, India head for global capital markets at Bank of America. Yet the market could see medium-sized listings as soon as the middle of next year, he said.\u201cIt is early days of a turn of risk appetite for both companies and investors,\u201d Roy said.The market isn\u2019t entirely devoid of activity. About $6.6 billion worth of block trades have been announced in India this year, representing nearly 28% of the Asia-wide total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Asian investors and emerging market funds were demonstrating strong demand for secondary share offerings, Roy said. Bank of America advised Uber Technologies Inc. in its $390 million sale of shares in Indian food-delivery company Zomato Ltd., and Softbank Group Corp. in its roughly $200 million block sale of Indian digital payments company Paytm.The crop of IPOs starting in the second half of 2023 could include five or six tech companies, he said. \u201cIt will not be a deluge, but a trickle.\u201d ",

        "articleBody": "Andhra Pradesh State Investment Promotion Board (SIPB), headed by Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, on Monday gave its nod for investments worth a total of Rs 23,985 crore in the state. In the meeting held, the board gave approval for JSW Steel Limited's proposal to set up a steel plant in Kadapa at a cost of Rs 8,800 crore, and for pumped hydro storage projects to be set up by Adani Green Energy Limited and Shirdi Sai Electricals, an official release said.  The officials informed the Chief Minister that JSW Steel Limited will invest Rs 8,800 crore in two phases for setting up the steel plant in Sunnapurallapalli village in Kadapa district.  In the first phase, JSW Steel will invest Rs 3,300 crore in the proposed plant and one million tonnes of steel per annum would be produced in the first year. Later, the plant will be upgraded to two million tonnes per year in the second phase and will eventually reach three million tonne capacity per annum, it said.  The Chief Minister asked the officials to ensure that the steel plant works commence as soon as possible and said it is a great effort in the process of changing the face of backward Rayalaseema region. Besides, providing employment to thousands of people directly and indirectly, many allied industries will be set up providing more employment opportunities.  JSW Group, a USD 22 billion conglomerate engaged in steel, energy, manufacturing, cement and painting, is producing 27 million tonnes of steel annually.  Besides, the board approved 1,600 megawatt pumped hydro storage power project by Adani Green Energy Limited which will invest Rs 6,330 crore providing direct employment to over 4,000 people, the release said.  The company will set up a 1,000 MW plant in Pedakota of Alluri Sitarama Raju district, and a 600 MW plant at Raiwada in Anakapalli and Vizianagaram districts.  The project is proposed to commence work in December 2024 and is set to be commissioned within four years. Around 4,196 million units of electricity per year will be produced, according to the release.  The SIPB has also cleared Rs 8,855 crore hydro storage projects by Shirdi Sai Electricals Limited which will set up two units at Yerravaram and Somasila to produce combined 2,100 MW power.  The company will set up a 1,200 MW project at Yerravaram and a second project of 900 MW at Somasila. The target is to commence the work in July 2023 and complete it in phases by December 2028.  After its commencement, the company will directly generate employment for 2,100 people, the CMO release said.",

        "articleBody": "India's Parliament has passed a Bill seeking to mandate the use of non-fossil energy sources such as biomass, ethanol and green hydrogen. The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill, 2022 cleared in Rajya Sabha - the Upper House - by a voice vote, after having passed the Lower House in the August session earlier this year. The legislation provides for penalties for violations by industrial units or vessels, and on manufacturers if a vehicle fails to comply with fuel consumption norms, including amendments to promote renewable energy and the development of a domestic carbon market to battle climate change.  With India's global commitments to climate change looming, the new Bill also aims at furthering those goals, with new introductions like carbon trading and mandating the usage of non-fossil sources to ensure faster decarbonisation of the Indian economy and help achieve sustainable development goals in line with the Paris Agreement.  Replying to a debate on the bill, Minister of New and Renewable Energy R K Singh said the bill is environment friendly and will allow carbon trading in the country.   For government, the environment is precious and will take all steps for that,  he said, adding India has now become a leader in the energy transition. Currently 24% of the energy consumption is from the housing sector and the government has targeted only the big commercial establishments having a load capacity of 100KW,  Singh said.  However, he added the state government has been given the liberty to reduce the building load up to 50KW.   We are also expanding the concept of green building. We are making it more sustainable. Earlier, it has energy efficiency and we are also adding the concept of renewable energy in this,  he added.  The country also aims to be a leader in green hydrogen and the ministry has already drafted rules and the industry is going to invest to set up capacity for 25 million tonnes of green hydrogen capacity.  Singh also said the country would achieve over 50 per cent of its power generation capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030.With inputs from PTI",

        "articleBody": "India will at the upcoming G20 meeting plans to pitch for a global alliance on biofuels on lines of the highly-successful international solar alliance, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Tuesday. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a coalition of solar resource-rich countries to address their special energy needs and was launched on November 30, 2015 by India and France to implement the Paris Agreement.  India, the world's third largest oil-consuming and importing nation, is now pushing for greater use of biofuels extracted from sugarcane, cereals and agri waste as a means to cut reliance on crude oil.   We will utilise our G20 presidency to try and set up an international biofuel alliance like the International Solar Alliance,  Puri said KPMG's ENRich 2022 conference here.  India is taking over the presidency of the group of 20 major economies, also called G20, and will host a meeting of the member nations in September next year.  With nations from Brazil to the US producing biofuels, the alliance would look to develop an ecosystem for fuel standards and engines and collaboration on technology for faster adoption.  Puri said India is already using petrol mixed with 10 per cent ethanol extracted from sugarcane and other agri products (90 per cent petrol, 10 per cent ethanol).   We have brought forward that target for mixing 20 per cent ethanol in petrol to 2024-25 from 2030. And going by the effort on ground, I can say with some degree of certainty that 20 per cent blending can be achieved even before 2024-25,  he said.  Several major biofuel producers, including the US, Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia and China, are part of G20.  India imports 85 per cent of its oil needs and doping ethanol with petrol is aimed at reducing the import dependence. Also, biofuels have lesser emissions and aid in meeting carbon goals.  Puri said India is diversifying its oil import basket, tapping newer supply regions.  From buying oil from 27 nations, the basket has now expanded to 37, he said.  Diversification would help in cutting dependence on any one particular region or country and help mitigate any supply shocks.",

        "articleBody": "Fossil fuel producers benefited from sympathetic treatment in Egypt at the COP27 climate talks, government officials said, bringing their influence to bear in rushed final negotiations and frustrating those who hoped for a more ambitious outcome. Officials said the host Egypt, a natural gas exporter and frequent recipient of funds from Gulf oil producers, was partly responsible, although the war in Ukraine and the subsequent European energy crisis also had an impact. Egyptian officials have said their priority was to provide a conducive atmosphere for negotiations and act as a neutral mediator. The presidency denied that fossil fuel producers had been given sympathetic treatment.   The end decision at COP27 was a compilation of inputs reached by consensus of all the UNFCCC parties who were all consulted,  it said in a statement, referring to nearly 200 countries taking part in the summit under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Demands from environmental groups and scientists that governments and companies should leave oil and gas in the ground have had less traction this year, since European countries have scrambled to replace Russian gas. The COP27 meeting yielded mixed results, with a hard-fought agreement on a fund for countries most harmed by climate change being welcomed by vulnerable nations, but a cover text that some officials said lacked ambition due to the influence of fossil fuel producers. The cover text summarises key outcomes of the summit.  The cover decision and the mitigation work program does not fully reflect the urgency of the climate crisis and did indeed cater too much to the more fossil and backward-looking forces,  said Espen Barth Eide, Norway's minister of climate and environment. Some of the countries that had pushed hardest for the new fund for loss and damage simultaneously tried to weaken language around phasing down fossil fuels, he added. LOW-EMISSION ENERGY The COP27 agreements are in line with what came out of the Glasgow meeting last year, to accelerate  efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies , rather than being strengthened to phasing down fossil fuels as some countries had pushed for. It also included a new reference to  low emission and renewable energy . The Egyptian presidency said the language reflected part of the  just transition  adopted by all parties, which includes the use of hydrogen and nuclear energy to reduce emissions.  Egypt's COP27 President Sameh Shoukry acknowledged there had been  disappointment in certain quarters  but told reporters after the deal that  a single party cannot achieve all their ambition, and this does not take away from the value of what was reached . For some, the Egyptian presidency had delivered a satisfactory deal by forging the agreement to set up a loss and damage fund. The idea had been resisted for years by some of the largest emitters, such as the United States and Europe, who were worried about the extent of liabilities. Loss and damage was  the one thing we wanted a lot for ages, and that being solved at a COP being hosted by a developing country, that in itself is a great win because it shows their diplomatic strength,  said Selamawit Wubet, an adviser to a group of countries highly vulnerable to climate change.  But climate activists and some delegates said little progress had been made on most other issues, contending that the tone had been set by fossil fuel producers who played a more public and prominent role in Sharm el-Sheikh than at previous summits. 'DIFFICULT TRANSITION'  It has now become quite clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is going to be a difficult one,  said Pakistan's UN Ambassador Munir Akram, citing the impact of the war in Ukraine. In the final 24 hours, the COP presidency held a meeting where calls from negotiators from countries and groups including Switzerland, the United States, Latin America and small island states, for Egypt to include language initially proposed by India to phase down all fossil fuels were unheeded, officials said. At least 80 countries supported such language, they said. Some negotiators expressed concern that Egypt had advanced its proposal without thorough consultation, as major emitters and producers took a stand against more ambitious goals on limiting fossil fuel use. The Egyptian presidency told Reuters the process was  praised by all parties for being focused and streamlined .  The issue of phasing down all fossil fuels was not agreed upon by many countries,  it said. ALL NIGHT TALKS Ahead of the final plenary meeting where a deal was struck just after 5:30 a.m. local time, a Reuters reporter saw some delegates caught off guard by the presidency's last-minute announcement of the session. Guards had to wake up some delegates sleeping on couches and chairs outside the plenary hall after 3 a.m., instructing them to go inside.   It was very rushed towards the end,  said Shauna Aminath, Maldives environment minister.  The normal procedure is that there would be more consultation and open dialogue on these things,  she said. The European Union, which had threatened to walk out, fell reluctantly in line to preserve the deal on loss and damage.  Egypt will hold the COP presidency until it hands over to the United Arab Emirates, an ally and a major hydrocarbons producer, in just under a year.  Holding COPs in petro-states may seem counterproductive but actually we can't ignore these countries. They need to be engaged in the process and putting pressure on them as a COP host may provide bigger gains,  said Mohamed Adow, founder of think tank Power Shift Africa.",

        "articleBody": "LONDON: India's electricity transmission system passed the difficult post-monsoon period this year with far less stress than in 2021, following a major effort to improve coal stocks and a big expansion of renewable generation capacity. There was no repeat of the widespread blackouts which plagued many parts of the country in late September and early October last year when coal-fired power plants ran short of fuel and were unable to keep up with demand. Grid frequency fell below the minimum target of 49.9 cycles per second (Hertz) just 5% of the time in October 2022 compared with 11% of the time a year earlier, according to Grid India. The improvement in frequency control is a sign of a healthier and more stable network able to meet peak loads more comfortably ( Monthly operational performance report , Grid India, Nov. 23). The country's coal-fired power generators started October with more than 9 days of fuel on hand compared with just 4 days at the same point last year, enough to ensure more were able to start up when needed. Temperatures in northern India were also slightly cooler than last year, reducing air-conditioning and refrigeration loads and offsetting the impact of economic growth. The average daily temperature in the New Delhi neighbourhood of Palam during October was 0.9 degrees Celsius lower than last year and 1.9 C lower than the long-term seasonal average.Total power consumption was broadly stable at 115 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in October from a year earlier.  But there was a big increase in renewable generation (+3.1 billion kWh) led by solar (+2.1 billion kWh) with smaller contributions from hydro (+0.7 billion kWh) and wind (+0.3 billion kWh). The result was less pressure on coal, gas and diesel generators, leaving more reserves to meet daily peaks and temperature-related variations in demand. Hydro, wind and solar supplied 25.4% of all electricity consumption in October, up from 22.8% twelve months earlier Total installed solar and wind generation capacity increased to 119 Gigawatts (GW) from 103 GW over the period. As in China, the massive deployment of renewables is beginning to slow the growth in demand for coal-fired generation. So far, the impact is marginal in India, and coal-fired generation is likely to rise again as total loads continue to grow, especially if temperatures are closer to seasonal norms.

A white paper will be prepared on a roadmap to develop new battery technologies in India. This would be followed by the creation of an expert-industry forum or platform to support this process, the CSE said in a statement on Tuesday.  This collaborative initiative was kicked off recently with a round table on locally appropriate EV batteries that are safe, durable and effective within the constraints of a hot and humid tropical climate.  Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE, said:  India has been working with FAME and production-linked incentives to push the EV story, but challenges are abound with regard to cost, safety and charging infrastructure - all of which point at gaps in fulfilling the country's zero emission ambitions. The gaps range from concerns relating to safety, supply chain, cost sensitivity and need for quick charging opportunities among others.    This joint initiative is aimed at addressing these gaps and to create a platform that will assess, evaluate and identify technology solutions that are safe, have locally appropriate supply chain systems and can be customised for various vehicle applications,  said Moushumi Mohanty, senior programme manager, Clean Air and Sustainable Mobility, CSE.  As part of the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020, the Department of Heavy Industry had formulated a scheme -- Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) in 2015 to promote manufacturing of electric and hybrid vehicle technology and to ensure its sustainable growth.",

Tamil Nadu, one of the highest per capita power-consuming States in the country, would play a prominent role in energy transition.  A highly industrialised State like Tamil Nadu notwithstanding its growing energy needs can reduce emissions by 25-32 per cent if the State integrates about 60 per cent of renewable capacity,  said the report 'Working Paper' released at the event 'Tamil Nadu Sustainable Energy Transformation Dialogues' in Chennai. The State is unique in having both thermal and renewable capacities, and with plans to add more of both generation sources. It is imperative to prudently evaluate future capacity additions and its impact on emission levels and future generation mix in the medium and long-term, said Sandhya Sundararagavan of WRI India. Energy planning tools can prove useful in visualising supply-demand possibilities, designing emission targets and carving out various ways to transition toward low-carbon pathways for the State, she said.Additional chief secretary, Tamil Nadu-planning and development, Vikram Kapur said,  We must benchmark per capita power consumption to optimise capacity additions and avoid redundancies.

        "articleBody": "The United Nations published a first draft of the climate deal on Thursday and it doesn't mention a phase-down of all fossil fuels, a proposal that was put forward by India and supported by the European Union and many other countries. The draft encourages  the continued efforts to accelerate measures towards the phase down of unabated coal power and phase out and rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards just transitions . Nearly the same language was used in the Glasgow Climate Pact last year. When contacted, a spokesperson of the Environment Ministry said the Indian negotiators do not wish to comment  as negotiations are going on . The cover text also doesn't mention when a loss and damage finance facility will be launched and what its contours will be. Poor and developing countries have demanded that the COP27 concludes with a decision to launch a fund to address loss and damage -- a term used for irreparable destruction caused by climate change-fuelled disasters. The text  stresses the importance of exerting all efforts at all levels to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels . The 20-page document, described as a 'non-paper' by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is 8,400 words long as compared to the Glasgow pact, which was around 4,600 words and was in itself one of the longest cover texts in the history of UN climate summits. India had proposed on Saturday that the talks wrap up with a decision to  phase down  all fossil fuels and not just coal. EU Vice President Frans Timmermans told the media on Tuesday that the bloc would support India's proposal  if it comes on top of what we already agreed in Glasgow . Citing the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Indian negotiators had told the Egyptian COP27 presidency that meeting the long term goal of the Paris Agreement  requires phase down of all fossil fuels .  Selective singling out of sources of emissions, for either labelling them more harmful, or labelling them 'green and sustainable' even when they are sources of greenhouse gases, has no basis in the best available science,  they said.",

The document, labelled a  non-paper  indicating it is still far from the final version, repeats the goal from last year's Glasgow Climate Pact to  to accelerate measures towards the phase down of unabated coal power and phase out and rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.  It does not call for a phase down of all fossil fuels, as India and the European Union had requested. The text does not include details for launching a fund for loss and damage, a key demand from the most climate vulnerable countries like island nations. Rather, it  welcomes  the fact that parties have agreed for the first time to include  matters related to funding arrangements responding to loss and damage  on the summit agenda.  It does not include a timeline for deciding on whether a separate fund should be created or what it should look like, giving time for negotiators to continue to working on the contentious topic. The document  stresses the importance of exerting all efforts at all levels to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.  The document is based on requests that delegates from nearly 200 countries have sought to be included in the final deal. It will provide a basis for negotiations over the coming days that are likely to substantially flesh out and rework the text.",

        "articleBody": "Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday said that India is committed towards meeting its obligation on climate change and has already started intense coal gasification drive involving public sector units and plantation to reduce carbon emissions.  Climate change is also going to be one of the key agendas at G-20 of which India is assuming presidency from December 1.  The minister, in an interview to PTI, said besides meeting its climate change commitment, India will also have to take care of its energy security and has to do a balancing act.   Whatever prime minister has given the commitment to the world that will definitely follow. For that we are going in a huge way for gasification where comparatively there will be less pollution. And also, we are going in a huge way for plantation,  the minister said.  The process of partially oxidizing coal with air, oxygen, steam or carbon dioxide to form syngas is called coal gasification.  He said that to strengthen the technology on coal gasification, the coal ministry has requested all PSUs (public sector units) to participate, and added that BHEL is taking a lead in this regard.   And along with that we have entered into an MoU with many PSUs, and we are involving private sector also.   He added that the government is providing Rs 6,000 crore towards viability gap funding for the gasification.  Joshi said that net-zero does not mean that India will stop emissions, but it will create capacity to absorb it, and added that as compared to the western world India's per capita emission is not even one-third.   We are a responsible country, responsible society and responsible political party,  he said, adding that India will take all steps required to reduce emissions.  For setting up four large-scale coal-to-chemical projects through surface coal gasification route, Coal India Limited (CIL) recently signed three separate agreements, one each with three major PSUs of the country -- BHEL, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd and GAIL (India) Ltd.  With an estimated cost of Rs 35,000 crore, the proposed surface coal gasification (SCG) projects are planned to be set up in West Bengal, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.  As the country's four major PSUs huddle together, the move is aimed at reduced forex outgo, promoting self-reliance and capitalisation of indigenous resources.  Another upside will be employment generation with direct employment of around 1,200 personnel and indirect employment to the tune of over 20,000 persons.  The coal ministry on a mission mode is fast-tracking utilisation of coal and has targeted to achieve 100 million tonnes coal gasification by 2030.",

        "articleBody": "At the UN Climate Change Conference, India has argued that the world must phase-down all fossil fuels, and not just coal, to achieve the Paris Agreement goals.This proposal was made as part of the 'cover decision', a political agreement that the host country pilots encapsulating issues not necessarily part of the official agenda.Last year in Glasgow, India had raised the issue of needing to phase-out all fossil fuel as against singling out one category of fossil fuel, namely coal. This was perceived as a defensive response to the growing calls  for ending the use of coal , and did not garner any support, observers said.At Sharm El Sheikh, India is proactively pushing for a decision that would commit all countries to plan an exit from the use of fossil fuels -gas, oil as well as coal. Indian negotiators have reached out to other countries with the proposal. The hope is that  weaponisation  of energy by Russia in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine might lead to more takers for the Indian intervention.The proposal acknowledges that a move away from fossil fuels will be gradual and in line with national circumstances, hence the phrase  phase down  as against a phase out, and does not have any target date. It urges all countries to accelerate transition to clean energy and to acknowledge that all fossil fuels contribute to global warming, while recognising that the shift will have to consider national circumstances.India has argued that singling out one type of fossil fuel and labelling it as harmful while promoting and accepting the use of other fossil fuels is not based on facts. There is an equity aspect to it as well. Coal use is mostly concentrated in developing countries while use of gas is more prevalent in rich industrialised countries. Singling out coal puts a bigger burden on poor developing countries while giving countries with greater resources more leeway in planning out their transition to clean energy.",

        "articleBody": "As world leaders huddle together in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh to chalk out strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change by reducing emissions, financial support is needed to address these concerns.To reduce emissions, suitable infrastructure needs to be built to promote green energy. For this purpose, according to World Bank data, all the countries need to make investments to the tune of $90 trillion by 2030.These investments, the World Bank found, can be recovered through transition towards green economy. This transition can create newer economic opportunities and jobs, it added.This concept is known as climate funding and it is one of the significant agenda items of the ongoing COP27 summit. The world leaders who are meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt to discuss the global climate negotiation during COP27, must acknowledge that the climate crisis needs immediate systemic solutions rather than more announcements without any impactful action. They must deliver and align with the principle of loss and damage, mitigation and adaptation, and climate justice. All countries should contribute in a just and fair manner to phase out fossil fuels dependance and implement strict actions to halve emissions by 2030, on the way to phasing out emissions completely,  said Avinash Kumar, Lead, climate and energy campaign at Greenpeace India.Responding to the climate crisis requires collective action from all countries, cities, financial actors, businesses, and private citizens.Among these concerted efforts, developed countries had committed to jointly mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020, from a variety of sources, to address the pressing mitigation and adaptation needs of developing countries, the United Nations said.There has been a surge in interest from companies and some major investors in adopting sustainable business plans that are compatible with a 1.5 degrees Celsius future, as decision-makers recognise the vast growth opportunities ahead in the global transition to a decarbonized economy by 2050. However, much wider progress is needed, and the journey of companies and investors, in aggregate, is only in its early stages, the UN further noted.Major pensions funds and investments firms, who acknowledge that their portfolios are now more aligned with a 3.5 degree future, are now starting to move at scale by working with the asset managers and companies in their portfolios to decarbonise and align with net zero targets.Kumar however informed that most developed countries did not meet their commitment to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. They are certainly not doing enough on their commitments. This (COP27 summit) is the last chance for developed countries to ensure low-income countries have access to the necessary resources to prepare themselves for the adverse effects of climate change and to decarbonise their economies.  The next few years are going to be crucial to tackle climate change. There is an urgent need to transform sectors such as energy, transport, agriculture, food, land use etc. from carbon-intensive to carbon sequestering,  he cautioned.",

The Electricity (Promoting Renewable Energy through Green Energy Open Access) Rules, 2022 were notified in June 2022. These rules seek to promote generation, purchase and consumption of green energy \u2014 including energy from waste-to-energy plants.This is part of the Power ministry initiatives for India's transition to green energy, some of which have reached advanced stages.",

The proceeds would be deposited in the Consolidated Fund of India and the framework provides the flexibility to roll over unallocated proceeds, if any, to successive years for investment in eligible green projects.The centre has set up a Green Finance Working Committee headed by chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran to oversee the selection of projects and fund allocation.",

        "articleBody": "Finance took centre stage at the COP27 climate talks on Wednesday, with U.N. experts publishing a list of projects worth $120 billion that investors could back to help poorer countries cut emissions and adapt to the impacts of global warming. A $3 billion water transfer project between Lesotho and Botswana and a $10 million plan to improve the public water system in Mauritius were among dozens of projects listed, including 19 in Africa.  We can now show that a meaningful pipeline of investible opportunities does exist across the economies that need finance most,  Mahmoud Mohieldin, one of the U.N. appointed experts, known as U.N. Climate Change High-Level Champions, said in a statement to accompany the report.  In an effort to answer the argument by private sector financiers that it's too risky to invest more in emerging markets, the experts, who help the COP host-governments engage with business, pulled together a list of projects that could be funded more quickly. After a year of meetings with stakeholders around the world, they released the initial list so that banks and others can assess the projects.  We now need a creative collaboration between project developers and public, private and concessionary finance, to unlock this investment potential and turn assets into flows,  said Mohieldin, High-Level Champion for COP27. However, another report released on Tuesday suggested that developing countries would need to secure $1 trillion in external financing every year by 2030, and then match that with their own funds, in order to meet the world's goal of preventing runaway climate change. Getting money to low- and middle-income countries so they can build infrastructure, such as renewable energy plants needed to replace fossil fuels, has long been a focus for the U.N. climate talks. But progress has been slow.  Even though the pipeline of interesting projects is there, they will require technical and financial help to get to a position where they can attract the right kind of finance,  said Nigel Topping, High-Level Champion for COP26.  We need all actors in the system to roll up their sleeves to make that happen,  he said.,  We won't get anywhere near unlocking the scale of finance developing economies need if everyone continues to pass the buck.  The world's leading development banks lent $51 billion to poorer countries in 2021, with private investors contributing $13 billion, a recent report from the lenders said.

        "articleBody": "Sharm El Sheikh: There has been a spike in non-state entities -businesses, financial and other institutions, cities and regions-announcing net zero targets. However, there is no way to determine if these pledges will help bend the emission curve. On Tuesday, an expert group set up by the UN Secretary General in March released a slew of recommendations that could, if adhered to, separate bogus claims from the genuine ones.The growing number of net zero and carbon neutrality pledges by non-state entities is good news but as the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres puts it,  the problem is that the criteria and benchmarks for these net-zero commitments have varying levels of rigour and loopholes wide enough to drive a diesel truck through. It is to fill this gap that Guterres appointed the high-level expert group led by former Canadian environment and infrastructure minister Catherine McKenna. The recommendations are not binding, it provides an objective framework to assess the impact of the pledges. It can help ensure integrity, transparency and accountability of the pledges by non-state entities. Our roadmap provides clear standards and criteria that must be followed when developing net zero commitments. Right now, the planet cannot afford delays, excuses, or more greenwashing,  said Catherine McKenna.The report states that net zero pledges must be in line with IPCC scenarios limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. It calls on these non-state actors to commit to immediate reductions in absolute emissions across its value chain with short, medium and long term, science-based targets. Detailed transition plans must show immediate emissions reductions and capital expenditures must be aligned with these targets and the non-state actor's net zero pathway.The UN chief has set a timeline asking all these entities to review their pledges in line with the guidance by next year's climate conference. The recommendations and the timeline are not enforceable. However,  if industry, financial institutions, cities and regions mean what they say in their net zero pledges, they will adopt these recommendations,  said Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics and a member of expert group.To prevent non-state entities from using net zero pledges as a way of taking meaningful action, the report says that non-state actors must report publicly on their progress with verified and comparable information. If we have to get serious about net-zero, greenwashing by corporations must stop,  said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Delhi-based think tank Centre for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and member of the high-level expert group.The report provides a set of tools and guidelines that would help weed out weak net zero pledges and identify attempts at greenwashing. It states that net zero pledges by entities that continue to build or invest new fossil fuels facility, deforestations and other environmentally destructive activities would not meet the mark.95386807",

Among those who have signed the MoUs are some of the industry leaders such as Suzlon Energy, Torrent Power and Blueleaf Energy, the Minister said. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has laid out the blueprint for the energy department for the next 10-15 years, he said.The government has brought out the new \u2018Renewable energy Policy 2022-27\u2019 which will give great boost to developing renewable energy projects in Karnataka. The Energy Department will take all measures to ensure that the renewable energy capacity is increased in future, he said.",

        "articleBody": "India can accelerate green investments to USD 12.1 trillion by 2050 and reap a host of benefits, a consultancy firm said on Thursday. With the ongoing rate, India's net Green House Gas (GHG) emissions will rise to 11.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2070 from the 2.9 gigatons in 2019, Mckinsey & Co said in a report.  However, India has the potential to create 287 gigatons of carbon space for the world if it accelerates its efforts to fight climate change, the report said, adding that this amounts to almost half of the global carbon budget for an even chance at limiting warming to 1.5 degree celsius.   India's decarbonisation will require an estimated USD 12.1 trillion (5.9 per cent of GDP) of green investments until 2050 for the 'accelerated' scenario,  it said.  India has committed to net zero emissions by 2070. As per earlier estimates, the shift to net zero by 2070 will require USD 10 trillion worth investments.  Mckinsey said there are tailwinds which would be of help to a country like India, including reducing costs of renewables, electric vehicles and progressive policies.  However, there are challenges as well, including renewable capacity addition of 10 GW increasing to 40-50 GW per year, and the reduction needed in battery and hydrogen costs, it added.  The consultancy firm said over 80 per cent of India of 2070 is yet to be built, and underlined an urgency to act in the ongoing decade for the right kind of investments to come in 2030s and 2040s for an orderly transition.  It said India can cumulatively have USD 1.7 trillion forex savings till 2070 from reduced energy imports of crude oil and coking coal if it transitions well.  The country can also become a manufacturing and research and development base for cleantech, including electric vehicles, batteries and electrolysers, it said.  The firm's senior partner Rajat Gupta said the benefits of a well-planned, orderly, accelerated transition would outweigh the downsides, given India's growth outlook.   But it would require the nation to act within this decade, using its growth momentum to build India right for the decades thereafter,  Gupta said, adding that while the actions can seem to be challenging, the journey is doable as most of the actions are economically viable.  The firm also suggested a ten-point agenda for accelerating the de-carbonisation, starting with laying out a detailed medium-term decarbonisation plan with sector-specific priorities and policy frameworks that provide the demand signals and a steady hand.  It also suggested the acceleration of the implementation of Compliance Carbon Markets within three years, enabling banks to support the transition catalysed by a green transition bank, higher adoption of renewables in the power sector and empowering a nodal authority to define a national land-use plan.  The consultancy also exhorted corporates to play on the  front foot , evaluate investment opportunities that these green trends will unlock and align with India's national plans or opportunities opened by decarbonisation of other countries.",

        "articleBody": "Spiraling energy costs caused by various economic factors and the Ukraine war could be a turning point toward cleaner energy, the International Energy Agency said in a report Thursday. It found the global demand for fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is set to peak or plateau in the next few decades.The report looked at scenarios based on current policies and said that coal use will fall back within the next few years, natural gas demand will reach a plateau by the end of the decade and rising sales of electric vehicles mean that the need for oil will level off in the mid-2030s before ebbing slightly by mid-century. Total emissions are currently going up each year, but slowly. Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,\u201d said the IEA's executive director Fatih Birol. A surge in demand following COVID-19 pandemic restrictions lifting and bottlenecks in supply chains have also contributed to soaring energy prices.\u201cThe energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point toward a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system,\u201d Birol said.The role of natural gas as a \u201ctransition fuel\u201d that will bridge the gap between a fossil-fuel based energy system to a renewable one has also taken a dent, the report said. Although it\u2019s a fossil fuel, natural gas is considered cleaner than coal and oil, as burning it produces less carbon dioxide.But despite the largely positive outlook, the report adds that the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix puts the world on track to a warming of 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, a whole degree (1.8 Fahrenheit) more than the target set in the Paris climate deal.That's in line with a U.N. report released Wednesday that said current climate pledges are \u201cnowhere near\u201d where they need to be to meet the ambitious target. Top climate scientists say that to keep warming in line with the 1.5 C goal, emissions need to be slashed by 45% by 2030.Energy policy analysts say that while there are promising steps in the right direction, the move toward clean energy needs to be much faster.\u201cClean energy investment is delivering. It is the reason why the world is on track to peak CO2 emissions. But that\u2019s only the first step. We need big emissions cuts, not a plateau,\u201d said Dave Jones, an energy analyst at London-based environmental think-tank, Ember.The report estimated that clean energy investment will be above $2 trillion by 2030 but added it would need to double to keep the transition in line with climate goals.\u201cThe energy crisis has detracted from the climate crisis, but fortunately the answer is the same to both: a gigantic step up in clean energy investment,  Jones said.\u201cThis report makes a very strong economic case for renewable energy which is not only more cost-competitive and affordable than fossil fuel alternatives but also is proving to be much more resilient to economic and geopolitical shocks,\u201d said Maria Pastukhova a senior policy advisor at E3G, a climate change think-tank.She added that leaders and negotiators at the U.N. climate conference in Egypt next month will need to \u201cdouble down\u201d on reducing the demand for energy and unlock finance for developing countries to help fund their transition to renewables which would speed up emissions cuts.",

Our founder started Siemens 175 years ago to provide answers to society's most pressing questions. The next transformation we are in is now, of course, utilising digitalisation to provide efficiency and sustainability for the future. I think we are very well-positioned.India is witnessing an infrastructure boom of sorts. What is Siemens' focus for India?For Siemens, India is a very important market. When we talk about urbanisation, India will also undergo one of the largest urbanisation transformations we have seen in the world. India is seeing a huge number of smart cities being created. Then, there is energy transformation from coal to renewable, even though the commitment to 2070 is later than others in terms of net zero. It is an important market with investments in infrastructure, and Siemens is also investing.We have 28,000 employees in India and, in the last five years, we spent \u20b91 billion in capex in India for our own facilities in manufacturing and local footprint. This is an investment for the future. This is also proof that India is very important for Siemens, and I know Siemens is also important for India - 100% of the energy that has been transmitted in India goes somehow through Siemens' veins, so to say. So, we are the backbone, we are the DNA of the energy system in India, when it comes to distribution. This is becoming even more important when we make it more intelligent and smarter because smarter networks are needed with de-centre generation.How much does Siemens plan to invest in India?We are in a silent period where we don't give any forward-looking statements. But... as we believe in the market, our investments are going to continue.Can you share some details about industry 4.0 and how Indian companies are approaching you for solutions?We are the undisputed leader in industry 4.0 globally. In all the manufacturing facilities and in India, they are benefiting from that technology in making it smarter, making it more efficient by using digitalisation. This is not only in our own premises but, of course, also for our customers. Now we are transferring this knowledge to infrastructure, building digital twins for infrastructure and power grids (more) equally than what we do in the industry. So, it's very important, I think, for our customers in India, and it plays a major role in India. We are well-positioned for it.Is Siemens competing with IT companies in attracting and retaining talent?We are an IT company, by the way, especially in India. We have more than 10,000 software developers globally, and I think more than half of them, around 6,000, are in India. So, we are, by size and by engineers, one of the top 10 software companies in the world. India is also supporting other businesses. We have our tech centres in Bangalore and Pune. We have engineers working who are supporting global business in the US, Germany, France, Middle East, everywhere.Yes, we are competing with tech companies, and it is about 'how do we win this game?' That's where 'technology with a purpose' comes into play. It is very difficult for us to get talent from universities because they follow the tech companies to begin with, and it's very attractive. But, once they've had this experience and after three to four years, if we get them connected, then they see what Siemens does and they are very likely to stay with us because they like the purpose. What do we do with our data analytics capabilities? We make trains more effective and safer; we bring more trains on the same tracks, which saves a lot of CO2; we optimise buildings and make them more resilient and smarter. There are a lot of things which resonate and this is where we can also compete with other tech companies.",

Coming a few weeks ahead of COP27, it sends a strong message of our two countries' commitment to a low-carbon future,  she added. The French embassy said the two countries believe that decarbonised hydrogen holds immense potential as both sides have adopted ambitious national hydrogen strategies.  On May 4, on the occasion of their meeting in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a clear mandate to foster bilateral cooperation on hydrogen,  it said.  The adoption of this roadmap delivers on this mandate. It aims to bring the French and Indian hydrogen ecosystems together in order to establish a reliable and sustainable value chain for decarbonised hydrogen and achieve our common goal to be world leaders in decarbonised hydrogen,  the embassy added.",

The RE capacity tripled over the last eight years, while solar has increased by 25 times. But we are not resting on our laurels. We have achieved this due to a bouquet of curated policy and program efforts, and structural changes. ",

        "articleBody": "India will take over as G20 presidency on December 1, opening up the opportunity to establish itself as a leader in the clean energy space, and to become a voice for the global south.It is the first time that the G20 presidency troika (current, previous and incoming) will all be developing countries.Many countries have faced global warming\u2019s impact in 2022, including heatwaves in India and across Europe and floods in Pakistan and Puerto Rico. Countries in the global south are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. India should use the G20 platform to enhance climate ambitions and ensure countries can access technology and finance to meet their goals.The G20, or the Group of 20, is a unique intergovernmental forum for developing and developed countries. A rotating presidency allows for a country to set an agenda that would further the G20\u2019s objectives while mainstreaming country-level issues.Energy and climate change have become focus areas for the G20. In 2015, the G20 called for the timely submission of countries\u2019 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDCs) and ratification of the Paris Agreement. Through its workstreams, such as the Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) and Energy Transition Working Group (ETWG), and engagement groups, such as the Think 20 (T20), the G20 has championed enhanced mobilisation of capital for green energy and strategies for decarbonisation without compromising energy access goals.It is not, therefore, surprising that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has indicated that India\u2019s presidency will focus on climate finance, energy security and green hydrogen in the energy sector. These themes are actively under discussion in Indonesia\u2019s G20 presidency and were also pivotal during the 2019, 2020 and 2021 presidencies of Japan, Saudi Arabia and Italy, respectively.India\u2019s G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant reiterated that the developed world has taken limited climate action, including on climate finance, which will be a key discussion point during India\u2019s G20 presidency. Recently, some developed economies, such as Japan, the U.K., the U.S., Germany, Canada and the European Union, expanded their climate finance commitments until 2025. But there is a long way to go, and developed economies could set the right example. Emerging economies, except for China, will need about US$2 trillion by 2030 to meet their climate commitments.During the Indonesian presidency, finance ministers and central bank governors held an exclusive meeting on climate mitigation in which they discussed policy and regulatory approaches to climate finance mobilisation as an extension to the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap mandated last year.In addition to ensuring a green COVID-19 recovery, countries need financing to adjust to increased climate vulnerability. This could require a higher allocation of funds for climate adaptation.During its G20 presidency, India should emphasise finance delivery as per earlier commitments, an enhanced private sector partnership, access to a global pool of environmental, social and governance (ESG) capital and the role of multilateral development banks (MDBs).Various global capital access risks like currency depreciation, monetary policy tightening, rising inflation, high interest rates, and sovereign guarantees need discussion, given the current geopolitical situation. Country case studies of innovative financing techniques, such as blended finance for derisking capital, especially for new technologies like battery storage, offshore wind, and green hydrogen, are important for a well-rounded discussion.Several countries have adopted different versions of green taxonomy, confusing investors and leading to greenwashing. Moreover, there are various disclosure methodologies for ESG ratings. There is a need for harmonisation and a common taxonomy framework, incorporating elements of climate justice and just transition, that works across all emerging economies.India should also help countries adopt appropriate governance, strategy and risk management structures to manage climate risks. This can help in the greater flow of capital to climate adaptation and mitigation. COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine exposed countries to fossil fuel price volatility, threatening energy security just as governments announced net-zero targets reiterating their commitment to combat climate change. India has a challenging role in steering the clean energy agenda without compromising energy security and sustainability. Having faced the conundrum for a long time, India must derive lessons from its experience in agenda setting.The Bali Compact of the Indonesian presidency, a set of voluntary principles for smooth energy transitions according to national circumstances, has energy security and affordability as key tenets. It notes that countries should not use energy for political coercion and increase accessibility to technologies and materials.From here, India must pivot discussions around knowledge and technology exchange, standardisation and political neutrality in energy.Hydrogen entered the G20 discussion during Japan\u2019s presidency in 2019. The discussion has since evolved to focus on green hydrogen during the ongoing Indonesian presidency.Green hydrogen is the new hope for decarbonising sectors such as refining, fertilisers, steel and cement.India wants to become a green hydrogen/green ammonia export hub. It could use the G20 platform to discuss green hydrogen\u2019s supply chain challenges, private sector participation in technology development and policy incentives for sectors to transition.(Vibhuti Garg is Director, South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and Purva Jain is Energy Analyst at IEEFA.)",

Some lenders made these suggestions during various individual interactions with the Reserve Bank,  said an executive aware of the developments.Banks are of the opinion that bringing such loans under priority lending list will help plug financing gaps in these sectors and help lenders meet their priority sector lending targets. Expanding the PSL category will also help lenders meet their requirements, which they are unable to do presently and are required to buy priority sector lending certificates,  said another executive aware of the matter. Banks are mandated to provide 40% of their adjusted net bank credit to priority sectors. 94770283Last month, the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) set up a committee to investigate various aspects of sustainable financing and lending with Environmental, Societal and Governance (ESG) issues in focus.IBA chief executive Sunil Mehta told ET that the banking body will examine the committee's recommendations and accordingly make a formal representation to the regulator. There are various suggestions on green financing and ESG related issues. A committee comprising of both Indian and foreign lenders has been set up to evaluate all the issues and best practices,  he said, adding that the banking regulator also expects IBA to play a role in capacity building.At present, lending towards eight sectors, including agriculture, micro and small medium enterprises, export credit, housing, education, renewable energy and social infrastructure is considered eligible under priority sector loans. This will help firms operating in these sectors scale up operations,  said Sumit Dhanuka, founder of ElectriVa, which sets up independent EV charging stations in India.Experts stress on the need to keep 'green washing' risks in view while defining sustainable finance. For example, investing in a business that claims to use recycled materials when it actually does not.... This could result in funds under sustainable finance getting channelised incorrectly,  said Vivek Iyer, national leader, financial services-risk, Grant Thornton Bharat.",

        "articleBody": "EKI Energy Services on Monday welcomed the government's stance on carbon credits and said that carbon credits and its trade is an imperative for climate positive plans. Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy R K Singh on October 6, said that the government is taking measures to make India a market for carbon credit which will be utilised to meet the country's NDC goals.  India has submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, emphasising that it is a step forward towards its long-term goal of reaching net zero by 2070.   We are happy to hear that this matter finally has greater clarity by the Minister himself. Carbon credits and its trade is an imperative and integral part of any climate positive plans given its capabilities to control GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions,  said Manish Dabkara, CMD & CEO of EKI Energy Services Ltd.  This clarification will enable the entire industry ecosystem to continue its efforts towards strengthening the country's domestic market with a steady supply of credits that will further accelerate India's journey to a carbon neutral future and pave the way for the market to unlock new potentials and unleash a new era of environmental activism in India, the Indore-based company said.  Carbon credits are earned by reduction of greenhouse gas emission in the atmosphere through climate-friendly projects, and can be used by governments, industries or private individuals to compensate for generating emissions elsewhere.  According to the updated NDC, India now stands committed to reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, from the 2005 level, and achieving about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.",

        "articleBody": "India and the United States on Friday announced the launch of a new energy task force to support large-scale integration of renewable energy needed to support the clean energy transition. The announcement of the initiative, which will further strengthen the India-US partnership in the critical energy sector to an altogether new level, came following a bilateral meeting between Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri and US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm here.During the meeting the two leaders underscored the critical importance of bilateral clean energy engagement to strengthen energy security and to accelerate clean, secure, and just energy transition. Meeting amidst volatility in global energy markets, continuing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasingly frequent climate-related challenges, the two leaders underscored the importance of ensuring reliable energy supplies to ensure balanced energy markets, including India's support for the US initiative to release crude oil from the strategic petroleum reserves, and the importance of diversifying to clean energy sources. Puri and Granholm reiterated the importance of private sector engagement to facilitate investment, inform policy, and accelerate technology deployment.  To that end, the United States and India continue to convene public-private task forces on hydrogen and biofuels, and announced the launch of a new Energy Storage Task Force to support large-scale integration of renewable energy needed to support the clean energy transition,  said a joint statement issued after the meeting. Puri and Granholm welcomed collaboration between Indian and US companies through a Memorandum of Understanding to deploy methane abatement technologies in India's city gas distribution sector under the Low Emissions Gas Task Force to help reduce emissions in the oil and gas sector. As climate and clean energy leaders, the United States and India share a common vision to deploy clean energy at scale during this critical decade to reduce emissions and achieve climate change mitigation goals, taking into account different national circumstances, it said. Through regular consultations on global energy markets, efforts to strengthen collective energy security, and deepening technical engagement to support economy-wide decarbonisation, the two countries are proactively addressing the multiple crises that the world faces through the US-India Strategic Clean Energy Partnership, said the joint statement. Welcoming the increased clean energy collaboration between stakeholders of both countries which is facilitating expanded clean energy investment, including in emerging technologies, the two leaders recognised that ambitious national climate and clean energy goals require concerted action and implementation at all levels of government to ensure their viability and sustainability. Discussing the progress on continued efforts to advance emerging fuels and technologies and electrification and decarbonisation of end use sectors, they also talked about hard-to-abate sectors. The Ministers were informed about various initiatives, including joint research and development on smart grids and energy storage and new collaboration on carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies, and the potential to explore collaboration on other novel technologies under the US-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy-Research (PACE-R). Among the enhanced bilateral efforts include strengthening the power grid to ensure reliable, affordable, and resilient clean energy supply including through smart grids and energy storage; assessing grid-integrated buildings, electric vehicles, and other distributed energy resources to support load management. This includes advancing renewable energy development and deployment, including to support India's goal of achieving approximately 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. India and the US are also working on advancing energy efficiency and conservation in appliances, buildings and the industrial sector; electrifying and decarbonising the transportation sector, including creating an enabling ecosystem through setting up an Electric Vehicle (EV) financing services facility in India; and reducing emissions across the oil and gas value chain including efforts at deploying methane detection and abatement technologies. The two countries are working in decarbonising the industrial sector through efforts at electrification, carbon capture and storage, and deployment of other clean emerging energy technologies; and deepening cooperation between Indian and US Department of Energy labs and agencies, like the EIA, and on energy data management, modeling, low carbon technologies.",

        "articleBody": "The IMF on Friday said that developing economies needed an investment of USD 1 trillion a year by 2030 solely in the renewable energy sector to stay on track to achieve the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050.  Observing that emerging markets and developing economies account for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions and many are highly vulnerable to climate hazards, the International Monetary Fund said these developing economies would need significant climate financing in the coming years to reduce their emissions and to adapt to the physical effects of climate change.   The investment needs of these economies solely in renewable energy could reach USD 1 trillion a year by 2030 if they are to stay on track to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,  it said, adding that developing economies alone will require up to USD 300 billion a year by 2030 to adapt agriculture, infrastructure, water supply, and other parts of their economies to counterbalance the physical effects of climate change.  If efforts to reduce emissions fall short of global temperature objectives set by the Paris Agreement, the need for adaptation financing will rise sharply for emerging markets and developing economies.  Estimates range from USD 520 billion to USD 1.75 trillion annually after 2050 depending on the emission pathway, it said.   Emerging markets and developing economies will need significant climate financing in coming years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation finance) and adapt to the current and predicted physical effects of climate change (adaptation finance),  the IMF said in a report released on Friday ahead of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank here.  In a simultaneous blog post, three senior IMF officials Torsten Ehlers, Charlotte Gardes-Landolfini, Fabio Natalucci, and Ananthakrishnan Prasad said private climate financing must play a pivotal role as emerging markets and developing economies seek to curb greenhouse gas emissions and contain climate change while coping with its effects.   Estimates vary, but these economies must collectively invest at least USD 1 trillion in energy infrastructure by 2030 and USD 3 trillion to USD 6 trillion across all sectors per year by 2050 to mitigate climate change by substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions,  they wrote.  While private sustainable finance in emerging markets and developing economies rose to a record USD 250 billion last year, the blog post said that private finance must at least double by 2030, at a time when investable low-carbon infrastructure projects are often in short supply and funding of the fossil fuel industry has soared since the Paris Agreement.  The IMF in its report said that scaling up private climate finance in emerging markets and developing economies calls for a multi-pronged approach with improvements across various dimensions, including support from multilateral development banks (MDBs), the IMF, and the public sector.   This reflects both the scale of financing needs and the variety of investments needed to achieve material climate change mitigation and adaptation. Innovative financing instruments can help overcome some of the challenges faced by the private sector in emerging markets and developing economies, such as credit and political risks and lack of scale,  it said.",

        "articleBody": "India has entered into a collaboration with California for research and innovation in the field of zero-emission vehicles to spur the development of its nascent EV industry and address climate risks. California has the world's most advanced zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) policies. It has an ambitious 100 per cent ZEV mandate by 2035. As part of the collaboration, the University of California, research institute Davis Institute of Transportation Studies, established a new India ZEV Research Centre. The California-India ZEV Policy programme is aimed at supporting ZEV uptake in India, spurring the development of an EV industry in India and contributing to India's industrial growth. In addition to addressing policy, technology, and investment strategies for a ZEV transition, it would identify opportunities for India to emerge as a strategic leader in the global ZEV transition. Announced in Pittsburgh last week on the sidelines of the Clean Energy Ministerial attended by Union Science and Technology Minister Jitender Singh, the California-India ZEV Partnership provides a unique opportunity for sub-national policy design as a lever for vehicle electrification, and importantly, harness the role of states as key laboratories of innovation, in both the countries and the global south, officials said.  While ZEV policies have been implemented in various parts of the world, the State of California is probably the only regional government to have the most comprehensive and oldest ZEV policy ecosystem,  said Deputy Chief of Mission, Indian Embassy, Washington, D.C. Sripriya Ranganathan during a round table in Pittsburgh on 'Accelerating ZEV Transitions: California-India Policy Cooperation' last week.  The learnings from the California experience along with other regions, would offer India an opportunity to consider a mix of policies that would support the uptake of ZEVs while simultaneously spurring the development of a nascent industry that can bring with it important industrial growth,  she said. According to Ranganathan, this California-India ZEV policy collaboration is very timely and will only further enhance the bilateral cooperation between the two countries. It will also elevate the amount of information and research brought to the transportation decarbonisation policy process in India, providing an opportunity to engage policymakers globally in well-orchestrated efforts, she said. The role of California as a state government and collaboration with potential other Indian states in addition to the Government of India, can provide a unique opportunity to leverage sub-national policy design as a key lever for vehicle electrification targets, and more importantly, harness the role of states as key laboratories of innovation, she said.  There already exists a strong precedent for a California-India ZEV Policy Collaboration with similar efforts in other sectors having been done in the past, with collaborations on air quality and electricity sector reforms to name a few,  she noted.  As India prepares to host both the Clean Energy Ministerial and the G20 next year in 2023, this platform presents us a unique opportunity to jointly accelerate ZEV transitions in developing countries including India, and continue to build on our commitment to addressing climate risks in the coming year,  Ranganathan said. According to the India Center for Energy and Transportation of UC Davis, India has led innovations in public procurement to spur EV adoption in public transportation, and electrification of last mile passenger and freight mobility in cities.  While the two regions have unique differences, such as India's large portfolio of two and three-wheelers, there are also common challenges such as electrification of hard-to-abate segments including medium and heavy-duty trucks,  it said. A California-India ZEV partnership provides a unique opportunity for sub-national policy design as a lever for vehicle electrification, and importantly, harnesses the role of states as key laboratories of innovation, in both the countries and the global south, the university said. The California-India ZEV policy programme among other things will showcase best practices in EV adoption from India on international platforms and unlock strategic dialogues on international climate finance for a ZEV transition.",

        "articleBody": "India is working to transform its energy landscape with a significant clean energy share, Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh has told the international community while asserting the country will achieve net zero emissions by 2070. By 2030, India has agreed to reach 500GW non-fossil energy capacity, shift 50 per cent of energy its requirements to renewable sources, lower overall anticipated carbon emissions by one billion tonnes and reduce carbon intensity of the economy by 45 per cent over the 2005 levels.  India is continually working towards transforming the energy landscape of the country with significant clean energy share,  Singh said at the Global Clean Energy Acceleration Forum, the joint convening of the 7th Mission Innovation and 13th Clean Energy Ministerial, here. Highlighting the need to strengthen long-term private sector engagement, he said the transition to bioeconomy is based on projects under development and deployment with high investment and high-risk ambitions.  I share one such milestone example. A pilot plant of 10 tons per day capacity with integrated enzyme production is being set up at Panipat Haryana. This plant will be commissioned by December and this will be the 1st indigenous technology for on-site enzyme production,  Singh said. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd has planned to supply this indigenous enzyme to a commercial 2G ethanol plant of 100 KL per day which is expected to be commissioned by the second quarter of 2024, he said.  Further, lignin valorisation process is also being developed to produce value-added products from waste lignin.  The minister noted that sustainable biofuels play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. The Department of Biotechnology has been supporting innovations in advanced biofuels and waste-to-energy technologies, Singh added.",

        "articleBody": "India may unwind a four-year-old decision to combine two state-run lenders as it seeks to sidestep local rules that restrict them from funding power projects in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing energy markets.The government is discussing a plan for state-run Power Finance Corp. to sell its controlling stake in REC Ltd. to transmission utility Power Grid Corp., Raj Kumar Singh, the nation\u2019s power minister, said in an interview in New Delhi. Power Finance and REC will enjoy their different exposure limits as separate companies, potentially resulting in greater project funding, he said. The nation, the world\u2019s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, is looking to add a record capacity of clean energy to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. However, the Indian central bank\u2019s rules to cap lenders\u2019 exposure to a business group limit both financiers\u2019 ability to fund such projects, as they are treated as one entity under the current ownership structure.The South Asian economy aims to triple its clean power generation capacity to as much as 500 gigawatts by 2030 and plans to build a robust distribution system to take that electricity to consumers. The government is seeking to ensure funds for the transition that could cost $2.5 trillion through the end of the decade, according to the country\u2019s climate pledges submitted in 2015.Power Finance had acquired the federal government\u2019s stake in REC in 2018, in a dramatic turnaround of an earlier proposal where REC was to buy a controlling stake in Power Finance. The deal would result in better synergies and create economy of scale, Singh had said then.Representatives for Power Finance, Power Grid and REC didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\u201cThe demand for finance is huge. If you\u2019re adding capacity at the rate I am, I will need all the sources of financing,\u201d Singh said on Wednesday. Separating the two lenders will \u201cunlock a lot of financing.\u201d ",

The Chief Minister said his government wants to set up industries all along the Karnataka stretch of the Mumbai-Chennai corridor and renewable energy all along the seashore.  We are doing extensive work in the field of renewable energy. We will soon start producing hydrogen fuel. We have signed Rs 1.3 lakh crore worth MoUs in renewable energy,  Bommai said. He was speaking at the inaugural function of the Indian Manufacturing Show-2022, organised by the 'Laghu Udyog Bharati' at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre.  There will be production of biofuel, solar, and hydrogen. We are going to produce ammonia from sea (water). It's an essential part of our agenda,  the Chief Minister said.  Karnataka takes steps, which others will follow , Bommai said, adding that the state recognises the entrepreneurship, research and development, skills and capital of the industrialists and helps them in whichever way it can. In this regard, he said the state has taken steps to offer the PLI (production linked incentives) to the industries. Speaking about the progress made in the defence sector, Bommai said earlier 90 per cent of the defence equipment were imported right from raincoat, daily use materials for the soldiers and also coffins.  Now 60 per cent of the defence requirement is produced in India by the Indians. To make this possible, a strong R&D is required, which we have started achieving. We will achieve 90 per cent manufacturing of defence equipment in the coming days,  the Chief Minister said. He also said that India has switched from a defence equipment importing country to an exporting country.  This is the change that is happening. It shows India has got the potential. It has to be explored, supported and harnessed. We need (to ensure) that talent gets recognised,  Bommai said. According to him, this was an era of change and the  curve of change is going upward .  We are lucky to be living in this time. Make best use of this time,  the chief minister in his appeal to the industrial leaders. He said the state has the best industrial, electric vehicle, employment and R&D policies.  The more you employ our local youth, we will give you more incentives,  Bommai told the gathering. He also appealed to leaders of industry to participate in the Global Investors' Meet (GIM) here from Nov 2 to 4, organised by Karnataka Government, and make the event successful.",

        "articleBody": "Fast transition to clean energy is  cheaper than slow or no transition  and the idea that going green will be expensive is  just wrong , a new Oxford study has claimed. According to a study by Oxford University researchers, transition to a decarbonised energy system by around 2050 is expected to  save the world at least 12 trillion dollars  as against a scenario where we continue to use fossil fuel energy at the current levels.   Rapid transition to clean energy results in lower energy system costs than a fossil fuel system, while providing more energy to the global economy and expanding energy access to more people around the world,  the study said.  The study's 'Fast Transition' scenario has shown a  realistic  possible future for a fossil-free energy system by around 2050, providing 55 per cent more energy services globally than today by ramping up solar, wind, batteries, electric vehicles, and other clean fuels such as green hydrogen (made from renewable electricity).   Past models predicting high costs for transition to zero carbon energy have deterred companies from investing, and made governments nervous about setting policies.   But clean energy costs have fallen sharply over the last decade, much faster than those models expected,  Rupert Way, a postdoctoral researcher at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, said.  For the study, the researchers analysed thousands of transition cost scenarios produced by major energy models and used data on 45 years of solar energy costs, 37 years of wind energy costs, and 25 years for battery storage.  They found that the real cost of solar energy  dropped twice as fast as the most ambitious projections  in these models, revealing that over the last 20 years  previous models badly overestimated the future costs of key clean energy technologies .  Doyne Farmer, who led the team that conducted the study at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, said,  There is a pervasive misconception that switching to clean, green energy will be painful, costly and mean sacrifices for us all - but that's just wrong.   The study showed that the costs for key storage technologies such as batteries and hydrogen electrolysis, are also  likely to fall dramatically .  Meanwhile, the costs of nuclear energy have consistently increased over the last five decades, making it highly unlikely to be cost competitive.   The world is facing a simultaneous inflation, national security and climate crisis, all caused by our dependence on high cost, insecure, polluting, fossil fuels with volatile prices.   This study shows that ambitious policies to accelerate the transition to a clean energy future as quickly as possible are not only urgently needed for climate reasons, but can save the world trillions in future energy costs,  Farmer said.  Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the costs of fossil energy have skyrocketed, causing inflation around the world.  The study, conducted before the current crisis, has taken account of such fluctuations using over a century's worth of fossil fuel price data. The current energy crisis underscores the study's findings and demonstrates the risks of continued reliance on fossil fuels.  According to the research, the response to the crisis should include accelerating the transition to low cost, clean energy as soon as possible.  The research is a collaboration between the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, the Oxford Martin Programme on the Post-Carbon Transition, and the Smith School of Enterprise & Environment at the University of Oxford, and SoDa Labs at Monash University.",

The government has developed a framework to sell the debt in line with widely-used principles from the International Capital Market Association, and is also liaising with the World Bank over best practices, they said, declining to be named as the talks are private.A lower cost of borrowing would help Asia\u2019s third-largest economy finance infrastructure and meet clean energy goals, while managing a record debt issuance plan. The first green bond sale will take place before the end of the fiscal year in March, and discussions are underway with ministries to identify projects such as renewable energy, automobiles and a Ganges river restoration campaign, the people said.India will be a latecomer to the global market for green debt, which has exploded in recent years, including debuts for Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. While it\u2019s common to get lower borrowing costs thanks to strong investor demand, it\u2019s often just a few basis points and a big greenium would be unusual. India\u2019s finance ministry declined to comment.94193011\u201cYou need to do some outreach and engage with investors to have a greenium,\u201d said Sandeep Bhattacharya, climate change advisor at GIZ and former India project manager of the Climate Bonds Initiative in Mumbai. \u201cThe size of the greenium is also very dependent on the market situation at that point in time.\u201dThat\u2019s particularly true this year, since global debt market sentiment has taken a hit thanks to surging inflation, central bank interest-rate hikes and the fallout from the war in Ukraine. ESG bonds are underperforming conventional debt in the sell-off, putting the size of any greeniums in doubt.Added to that, currency risk could pose a hurdle for foreign investors interested in India\u2019s first green bond, which will be in rupees. The currency is down about 7% this year, poised for its worst annual depreciation since 2018 in the face of broad dollar strength despite India\u2019s central bank selling dollars to curb depreciation. The yield on the benchmark 10-year sovereign note has climbed to 7.12% from 6.46% at the end of last year, making it more expensive for the government to raise additional funding.India will first issue only a few small tranches of the green debt to test appetite, the people familiar said. The government budgets to raise a record 14.3 trillion rupees in the year through March 2023, and initial reports suggest green bonds will be more than 200 billion rupees. Some funds with a green mandate are interested. Client demand for \u201cgreen, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked bonds in emerging markets, both in US dollars and local currencies\u201d means asset manager TCW Group Inc. would consider investing in India\u2019s debut, said David Loevinger, a managing director at the Los Angeles-based firm.Indian debt is also on investors\u2019 radars as JPMorgan Chase & Co. conducts a semi-annual review of its emerging-market debt index, and the expulsion of Russia could open the door to India\u2019s addition to the benchmark. If India is added to global bond indexes, \u201cthere\u2019d be even more investment for India\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d Loevinger said.",

The Rajasthan Electric Vehicle Policy (REVP) came into being from Thursday under which the government has sanctioned a fund of Rs 40 crore for contribution on the purchase of electric vehicles.  An official of the transport department said that a notification in this regard was issued on Wednesday. The policy will be for a period of five years from September 1, 2022.  Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had announced the policy in the budget 2019-20, and had approved the draft policy on 24 May this year.  Under this, the government approved the proposed one-time contribution on the purchase of electric vehicles and an additional budget provision of Rs 40 crore for reimbursement of State Goods and Services Tax (SGST).  With the increase of electric vehicles, which is encouraged through the policy, pollution caused by diesel and petrol vehicles in the state will come down, the official said.  The state government had announced to reimburse Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 SGST amount for two-wheelers and Rs 10,000 to 20,000 for the purchase of three-wheelers according to the battery capacity of the vehicle.  At the same time, the transport department has received a sum of Rs 40 crore to clear the pending cases of grant on the purchase of electric vehicles.   We have received funds from the state government and all pending dues related to electric vehicle purchase of this financial year will be cleared soon,  Transport Commissioner K L Swami said.  An amount of Rs 18 crore was given as grants to people who bought e-vehicles in the last financial year in 12 Regional Transport Office (RTO) areas of the state.  Of Rs 40 crore, a grant amount of Rs 5 crore is to be disbursed to 3,000 vehicle owners (who purchased vehicles in the current fiscal year) in the state, which will be done soon.",

        "articleBody": "The economic benefits of India stepping up its transition to climate neutrality by 2070 are immense\u2014boost of up to 4.7% to the annual GDP by 2036 and creating some 15 million new jobs by 2047, according to a report by the High-Level Policy Commission on Getting Asia to Net Zero. The benefits are even greater if India reaches net zero carbon emissions by 2050, said the report released on Friday.The High-Level Policy Commission on Getting Asia to Net Zero was constituted by Asia Society Policy Institute, a New York-based think tank.The report was released by members of the commission--Asia Society global CEO and former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and Vivek Pathak, head of climate business at International Finance Corporation (IFC). This is the first report by the Commission.Rudd told ET that the objective is to be \u201chelpful and supporting governments to get to net zero. And to do so not just with earnest moral wishes but to do so with econometric modelling that demonstrates how it can be done that is consistent with continued economic growth\u201d.Earlier this month, the Cabinet approved India\u2019s updated nationally determined contributions (NDC) that are to be submitted ahead of the September 23 deadline by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The enhanced goals draw on the prime minister\u2019s announcements at COP26 in Glasgow but do not include all of them. \u201cMost sensible governments under promise and over deliver. I expect the same from the government of India,\u201d said the former Australian PM. The report\u2019s foreword by the commissioners take note of the updated NDC.The report comes as the government is working on drawing up and finalising India\u2019s long-term strategy (LTS) for submission to the UNFCCC. Describing the NDC and LTS as the \u201ctwin pillars of credibility of the entire UNFCCC framework\u201d, Rudd said that without these two foundational documents \u201cthe credibility of the nation-state's participation in the global effort to tackle climate change collapses\u201d.India has been vocal about its developmental challenges and the need for support to ramp up its climate ambitions, even as it meets basic developmental requirements of its population. Rudd, and the report, acknowledge that India cannot make the transition without impacting developmental needs in the absence of international financial and technological support.At the same time, Rudd stressed that the transition is a challenge and opportunity. \u201cThere are three big things staring at the world economy--energy security in terms of international fossil fuel supplies, supply chain disruptions, and consumers increasingly demanding green supply chains,\u201d said Rudd. Given this, and that the world is demanding manufactured goods, India has the opportunity to ride a whole new wave of manufacturing that is less carbon intensive.\u201cA choice between dealing with older plant and equipment in China, which is much less carbon-friendly, or newly installed renewable capacity in India, the current geopolitical scenario with the selected economic decoupling of parts of the world with China, and the supply chain resilience question\u2014put together it potentially puts India in a new winning position in terms of engineering the transformation,\u201d said Rudd.Optimistic about India, the former Australian PM said, \u201con one side, we see massive economic and energy transition, on the other we see a massive opportunity. It depends therefore, which way you look at it. What I am impressed by is that Prime Minister Modi has chosen to look at as the latter.\u201d.",

        "articleBody": "Even as India is set to communicate its updated 2030 climate targets or nationally determined contributions (NDCs), it has begun work on the long-term action plan to achieve net zero target by 2070, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the last year's Glasgow climate conference.India is actively working on formulating Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) paper, a climate action document that will spell out the country's roadmap to net zero.Hectic inter-ministerial consultations were underway to draft out a 'whole of economy' approach involving several stakeholder ministries, officials said.ET has learnt that 7-8 sector-specific groups have been set up to devise a targeted low-emission growth trajectory, with adaptation and mitigation measures across areas such as energy supply, transport, agriculture, industry, waste and buildings, besides carbon capture technology, R&D and finance.  We are in the process of readying the long-term low GHG emission development strategy paper. This will address our 2070 net zero goal. Rounds of inter-ministerial as well inter-sectoral discussions are on for the same as this is a 'whole of economy' exercise covering energy, urban growth, industrial transition, technologies for carbon capture and more,  an official involved in the exercise told ET. We are assessing both the opportunities that will come with such a holistic transition as well as the uncertainties and the barriers in the way. Seven working groups are in place for the same to ensure this massive energy transition,  the official said.Just transition and the need for GDP development are also likely to figure in India's document.A total of 50 LT-LEDS representing 60 parties have so far been communicated ahead of the Conference of Parties-27 scheduled to be held in November in Egypt. India is yet to send its LT-LEDS and is silent on the timing of its submission.  We are not running against a deadline, but we are actively working on it,  officials said.LT-LEDS will amplify the ambitions India will set in the NDCs and these will be communicated to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The Union Cabinet recently approved the new NDCs which will see India commit to reduce emission intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 (from 2005 level) and achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. India's updated NDC will be implemented over the 2021-2030 period, said a government statement, adding that this exercise was also a step towards achieving India's 'long-term goal of reaching net-zero by 2070'.

        "articleBody": "India will miss its renewable energy target for the end of the year, with experts saying \u201cmultiple challenges\u201d including a lack of financial help and taxes on imported components are stalling the clean energy industry.The country has installed just over half of its planned renewable energy capacity, a high level parliamentary report found last week.The target, set in January 2018, would have increased India's renewable energy capacity to 43% of its current energy mix. The government now says it hopes to achieve the goal by mid-2023.The shortfall is down to  inconsistent federal and state-level renewable energy policies, excessive custom duties on renewable energy related products as well as financing issues,\u201d said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist based in New Delhi, who added that the solar industry is particularly vulnerable to such roadblocks.She added that \u201cimproving the financial health of government-owned power companies\u201d would help build out renewable capacity in India. State-owned power companies have been struggling as a result of delays in government grants and consumer payments and the COVID-19 pandemic which led to shutdowns of energy-heavy industries.India's parliamentary committee stated that ministry-level approvals for solar projects take \u201can unduly long time\u201d making it difficult for new solar parks to open.It added that state-owned energy companies owe 117 billion rupees ($1.5 billon) to renewable energy generators and developers and the debt contributed to the slow buildout of clean energy.The Indian government\u2019s ministry of new and renewable energy, which is in charge of meeting the nation\u2019s renewable energy targets, attributed the failure to meet targets to the COVID-19 pandemic.India, the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide after China and the U.S., recently finalized its climate targets and pledged that 50% of power generation will be from clean energy sources by 2030. The country's energy needs are expected to double by the end of the decade as the populations grows and the government seeks to improve living standards.India's climate targets were rated as \u201cinsufficient\u201d by Climate Action Tracker, an organization which conducts independent scientific analysis to determine if a country's ambitions are in line with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) or 2C (3.6F).Other observers say that the failure to meet these targets is not as big a setback as it appears to be.While the target won't be achieved,  it has played an important role in directing India\u2019s electricity and power generation systems towards renewable energy,\u201d said Ashish Fernandes of Climate Risk Horizons, an organization which looks at the risks climate change poses to India's economy.He added that long-term agreements to purchase coal power has stopped federal and state energy companies from investing heavily in renewables.\u201cWe need to start retiring old, expensive coal plants and replacing them with renewable energy. This can save energy companies and consumers a lot of money as well,\u201d he said.",

        "articleBody": "An analysis and advisory organisation has released an update on India's  first-ever effort  to track green investment flows, which are falling far short of the country's current need for its ambitious climate targets. Climate Policy Initiative in its report titled 'Landscape of Green Finance in India', has claimed that  the tracked green finance in 2019-2020 was Rs 309,000 crore (nearly USD 44 billion) per annum, which is less than a fourth of India's needs .  The report estimates that for India to achieve its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement, the country requires approximately Rs 162.5 lakh crore (USD 2.5 trillion) from 2015 to 2030 or roughly Rs 11 lakh crore (USD 170 billion) per year, the US-based organisation said in a statement.  The evaluation of finance flows has been estimated for key real economy sectors like clean energy, clean transport and energy efficiency, the organisation said.  The study tracks both public and private sources of capital -- domestic as well as international -- and builds a framework to track the flow of finance right from the source to the end beneficiaries through different instruments with an emphasis on bottom up approaches based on actual flows rather than commitments, providing the most accurate analysis to date of where India's climate finance stands, the finance gaps it faces, and the opportunities that lie ahead, the statement said.  This year, the report also provides a first-of-its-kind evaluation of adaptation financing for select sectors.  The report shows increased flows to renewable energy sectors. This indicates the positive role policy support has had on the renewable sector. We would also in the future hope to see a similar role being played in other sub-sectors like distributed renewable energy - rooftop solar and clean mobility,  said Neha Khanna, project manager and lead author, Climate Policy Initiative-India.",

As India's leading power companies, NTPC and Tata Power are role models for charting successful pathways to transforming their business models and attracting foreign private capital,  says the report's co-author Saurabh Trivedi, Research Analyst at IEEFA. However, successfully engaging serious green investors would depend on the companies' ambition and the transparency of their transition plans. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that financial institutions voluntarily mitigate the potential climate risk in their portfolios. Such a move would require their clients in the emissions-intensive industries to set sustainable energy transition strategies.The RBI's recent consultation paper also recommended that financial institutions start factoring in climate risk while investing in or lending to energy transition-vulnerable sectors.IEEFA's report notes that NTPC and Tata Power may be able to meet their capital requirements through traditional financing. However, if the RBI's recommendations are implemented the companies are likely to face rising financing costs. Global investors are increasingly concerned about climate risk,  say Trivedi and co-author Christina Ng, Research and Stakeholder Engagement Leader, Debt Markets, at IEEFA. To access new financing instruments in foreign capital markets, such as sustainability-linked bonds and loans, Indian fossil fuel-based companies must convince foreign investors, especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) investors, that they are taking big steps to become clean energy companies. This involves explaining how they plan to adapt their business models, establishing ambitious targets and outlining financing strategies to achieve their targets. The report notes that NTPC and Tata Power have commendable clean energy deployment plans that will require significant capital expenditure.However, their plans to reduce emissions intensity by 17 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, by 2030 fall short of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) proposed pathway -- a key consideration for global ESG investors.Tata Power is expected to publish revised emissions reduction targets, which are currently in the validation stage with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Adopting more ambitious emissions reduction targets alongside formal outcome-based finance frameworks, known as sustainability-linked finance frameworks, to raise capital to achieve these targets would send the right signals to ESG investors. It would unlock new avenues of capital,  says Trivedi.To follow the IPCC's proposed emissions reduction pathway or the SBTia\u00bfs recommendations to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, NTPC would have to accelerate the decommissioning of coal mines and existing coal-fired power plants and stop constructing new ones, while Tata Power would have to disclose and set out a plan to divest from stakes in Indonesian coal as well as accelerate decommissioning of its coal-fired power plants.The UN-backed Race to Zero campaign and the SBTi recommend that power companies commit to achieving net zero across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2040 or earlier.IEEFA's report comes at a time when decarbonisation plans of countries and companies are coming under increased scrutiny. Assessments such as the NewClimate Institute's recent report help governments and corporations find gaps and address them.Credible steps by NTPC and Tata Power to transform into clean energy companies will help India delivering on its international climate commitments, says Trivedi. Increasing non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatts and the reduction of projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030 were not included in India's updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC),  he says. Yet renewable capacity additions will have to expand at a far faster rate for India to be on a pathway towards limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celisus. This requires fossil fuel companies to redouble their efforts to transition to a clean energy future. ",

        "articleBody": "Developed countries are no match to India in the speed at achieving their pledges for clean energy as it has concern for the environment and is working towards becoming self-reliant in the energy sector, Minister of Power and New and Renewable Energy R K Singh said in the Lok Sabha on Friday. He made the remarks after moving the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill in the House for consideration. The Bill seeks to make it mandatory for buildings with a minimum connected load of 100 kW to meet their energy requirements from renewable sources. Singh said every country wants to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to deal with climate change and global warming, which has led to a campaign towards adopting renewable or clean energy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP 21, India had pledged that by 2030, 40 per cent of its energy generation capacity would be met from non-fossil fuel sources such as renewable energy, the minister said, adding that this was achieved in November 2021 itself.  Large economies and developed countries are no match to India in the speed at achieving pledges for clean energy.... There are two reasons for it -- one is our concern for the environment and the second reason is that we want to make our country self-reliant,  he said.  We have to end our dependence on foreign imports of things like petroleum and coking coal,  Singh added. He said today, the country is in a strong position in terms of power generation and connectivity and power cuts are reported not due to non-availability but because of local reasons. The Bill seeks to mandate the use of non-fossil sources, including green hydrogen and green ammonia, the minister said. Initiating the discussion on the Bill, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Jagdambika Pal said it has been brought due to the increasing carbon emissions in the world and the concern over climate change. He said the United States, the European countries and China contribute more in terms of carbon emissions but despite this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown great commitment to combat climate change. Pal said the Bill is being amended so that the means of transport run on clean energy and green infrastructure is created. He said the State Energy Conservation Fund would also be created with this Bill. Participating in the debate, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra said the Bill is a step in the right direction but added that this government has an uncanny knack of ignoring what is important and concentrating on headlines.  For example, when we should be looking at the GDP, we are being exhorted by the government to concentrate on our DPs (display pictures),  she said in an apparent swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal to people to put the tricolour as the profile picture of their social media accounts between August 2 and August 15.  Currently, 95 per cent of the hydrogen produced is grey hydrogen, which is from natural gas, so there are technological challenges for transportation and usage. A major research and development effort is required in the green hydrogen space. It will not be easy to shift from 95 per cent grey hydrogen to green hydrogen,  Moitra said.  We have to be really serious about energy conservation and encouraging energy conservation and it is just not enough to be a government of gasbags. We have got to do more than that,  she said. The debate remained inconclusive and would be taken up later. Singh had introduced the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill in the Lok Sabha earlier this week. The Bill seeks to mandate the use of non-fossil sources, including green hydrogen, green ammonia, biomass and ethanol for energy and feedstock.",

        "articleBody": "India dropped its target of establishing 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, giving itself the flexibility of 50% power from non-fossil fuel sources by then in its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This keeps India's options open for new coal-based power plants in the projected 820 GW total capacity, if excess demand cannot be met from green fuels, sources told ET.The Cabinet on Wednesday approved India's updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to be communicated to the UNFCCC. The updated NDC proposes about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, dropping the 500 GW absolute target committed at COP26. It also did not include the commitment to reduce one billion tonnes of carbon emission by 2030.  'Capacity to Depend on Power Demand'  India had made a commitment to generate 500 GW of power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 and reduce carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by the end of the decade at the COP26 conference, held in Glasgow in November last year.The NDCs are the core of the Paris Agreement on climate change that countries have to communicate and update periodically. The updated NDC commits to reducing the emissions intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030 from the 2005 level, not mentioning the one billion tonne carbon emission reduction.93357506An official statement issued after the cabinet meeting reiterated India's long-term goal of reaching net zero by 2070. The updated NDC has a flexible approach towards renewable energy generation that in reality depends upon power demand,  a senior government official told ET.  If the demand for power is high, the generation should be high, rather than setting rigid targets. It is, however, clear that 50% of the country's installed generation capacity will be based on non-fossil fuel sources, including large hydro, he said.Another official said the updated goals keep the window open for new thermal power plants. As long as we keep the fossil below 50%, we can raise the TPP (thermal power plant) capacity,  he said.  In case demand is higher, renewable energy can grow rapidly by 2030, accommodating more thermal capacity. Power and renewable energy minister RK Singh recently said the country's installed capacity is expected to be 820 GW in 2030. In an interview with ET in May, he said India is a big country and demand has only started growing now. The industrialised countries have been using fossil fuel for their growth for the past many decades. Our first requirement is to make sure there is enough power available for growth. There is not going to be any compromise on that,  he said on being asked about halting new coal plants. India's current installed power capacity is 404 GW, consisting of coal-based 204 GW (50%), renewable energy sources 114 GW (28%), and hydro 47 GW (12%). Nuclear power generation capacity is 7 GW, gas-based power 24 GW, and lignite and diesel-based 8 GW.The Central Electricity Authority has forecast that the country's reliance on coal will drop from 53% in 2021 to 33% in 2030, whereas solar and wind together will make up 51% from 23% in 2021. Coal contributes about 67% of the energy generation. However, no new coal-based plants have been set up in the past decade. NTPC Ltd recently announced it would be setting up its first coal-fired plant in many years.",

        "articleBody": "India is planning to start a carbon trading market for major emitters in the energy, steel and cement industries, as part of its efforts to hasten the transition to cleaner fuels.The platform is likely to be announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Independence Day celebrations on Aug. 15, according to people with the knowledge of the plan. It\u2019s been in the works since March, when consultation with ministries and companies began, said the people who asked not be named because discussions are private.The Prime Minister\u2019s Office and government think tank NITI Aayog didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.The market would initially be limited to hard-to-abate sectors, allowing participants to trade credits earned from cutting emissions, the people said. One of the goals is to ensure state-owned energy firms like Oil & Natural Gas Corp., Indian Oil Corp. and NTPC Ltd., as well as steel and cement companies, can benefit from planned investments in carbon-capture projects, they said. India, the world\u2019s third-biggest emitter, surprised pundits by announcing a plan to achieve net zero by 2070 at the COP26 summit in Glasgow late last year. While that\u2019s a decade behind its fellow Asian behemoth China, the South Asian economy is less developed and faces greater climate challenges. The country is looking to cut 1 billion tons of emissions by 2030 as a first step in reaching its goal.India\u2019s proposed market follows a similar one in China, which last year launched a mandatory trading system for all large power plants. But the market has been plagued by delays and problems with data collection, and has seen only lackluster buying and selling of allowances.A detailed plan for establishing the carbon market is likely to be ready in the fourth quarter, the people said. India is also looking to introduce methanol-blended fuels in land and marine transport, build more carbon capture projects, and encourage the adoption of electric vehicles as part of its climate goals, they said.

There will be a removal of eight minerals from the restricted list that presently forbids production by private enterprises, including lithium, beryllium, and zirconium. This would enable the government to auction off licences to explore lithium reserves, Bloomberg quoted a source. In wake of this action, the government is also aiming to reduce India\u2019s dependence on imports for some key minerals while putting the country in a better position to compete in the lucrative battery supply chain. The country also seeks to expand domestic production of a variety of zero-emission technologies in order to meet its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2070 and to benefit from opportunities presented by the world's transition to cleaner energy.It has also committed to constructing 500 gigawatts of clean energy capacity by 2030, and it is believed that in order to make it possible for renewable energy to be used continuously, massive amounts of battery storage must be deployed.According to the mines ministry, government organisations have been searching for lithium and have found a modest supply at a location in the Karnataka state. However, India would still need to identify and develop more deposits if it wanted to produce lithium on any significant scale and lessen its reliance on imports.China is the top refiner in the world, while Australia and Chile now provide the most raw materials. As per the data from the trade ministry, India's imports of lithium-ion batteries increased by 54 percent from a year earlier to $1.83 billion in the year ended in March.Despite India's efforts to avoid imports from its northern neighbour, China and Hong Kong together accounted for over 87 percent of the purchases. Along with efforts to increase domestic output, the nation is also looking abroad for lithium and cobalt assets. To purchase mines abroad, a joint venture has been established with National Aluminium Co., Hindustan Copper Ltd., and Mineral Exploration Corp.Inputs from Bloomberg",

In his message at the launch of a report of The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), Singh said:  By 2030, the total capacity for power production would be about 820GW. Out of that, more than 500GW will be non-fossil.   Pointing out that India has already started adding storage capacity to renewable energy, the minister said the government has come out with one of the largest bids on storage and is trying to bring down the storage cost by adding volume.  He also emphasised on India's commitment to energy transition targets though the country has one of the lowest per capita emissions.  TERI on Wednesday released a roadmap charting the feasible pathways to achieving the ambitious decarbonisation targets.  Apart from suggesting policies as well as technological interventions to achieve the 2030 goals, TERI's roadmap also calls for state leadership in the development of pumped storage plants and feed-in-tariff for solar generation.  Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI, said in the statement,  While India has the right policy regime in place, we need to adopt new energy storage solutions and technologies which bring stability and flexibility to the grid. We need collaborations for investing in research and development of new technologies. ",

The renewable purchase obligation (RPO) specified by the union power ministry for the last three financial years was 17.5% in FY20, 19% in FY21, and 21% in FY22. However, compliance by state distribution companies has been very low.As per the Electricity Act 2003, the state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) are required to fix a minimum percentage of the total consumption of electricity by a distribution company for purchase from renewable energy sources.As per the trajectory prepared till FY30 by the union ministries of power and renewable energy, the RPO targets will increase gradually from 24.6% in FY23 to 47.33% in FY30. The government has fixed separate trajectories for wind power, hydro power, energy storage and other energy sources.The wind RPO starts this year with 0.81% till 6.94% in FY30. Similarly, the hydro power obligation will be increased from 0.35% in the current fiscal to 2.82% in eight years. Glasgow Summit  Energy storage obligation has been pegged at 1% for FY24 to be scaled up to 4% in FY30. The balance under 'other RPO' has been fixed at 23.44% this fiscal for 33.57% in FY30. At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November 2021, India committed to achieving 500 GW non-fossil energy capacity by 2030 and meeting 50% of energy requirements through renewable energy.",

        "articleBody": "Central Public Sector Enterprises involved in renewable energy projects will soon be permitted to import components from China, overriding restrictions imposed on them in 2020 to procure items from countries which share a land border with India.ET gathers that the Centre has agreed in principle to relax curbs for CPSEs like NTPC engaged in commercial renewable energy projects to get them on a \u2018level playing field\u2019 with private sector competitors which do not face import restrictions.The exemption will enable NTPC and other CPSEs engaged in RE projects to cut costs by directly importing from bidders/companies from China without the mandatory requirement of registration in India. A go-ahead for the exemption was given to CPSEs at a recent meeting chaired by the Cabinet Secretary. ET gathers that the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy will now make a formal proposal to the Finance Ministry to introduce the exemption clause.The curb on CPSE imports from firms based in China and other countries with which India shares a land border was introduced after clashes at Galwan in July 2020, although Mission Atmanirbhar Bharat was cited for change introduced through Rule 144 (xi) of the General Financial Rules that govern public procurement in India.Rule 144 (xi) to GFR directed that any bidder from a country \u2014 for any goods/services including consultancy and non-consultancy services and turnkey projects \u2014 that shares a land border with India, will have to be registered with a competent authority.Government ministries and departments apart, this applies to all autonomous bodies, public sector banks and financial institutions, PPP projects and so on. NTPC also came under the purview of GFR Rule 144(xi) among other CPSEs engaged in RE projects.However, since import dependence is still high in the RE sector and is mainly addressed through Chinese firms, the registration requirement put CPSEs at serious pricing disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis private sector competitors. CPSEs have largely had to import the same through engineering, procurement, and construction contractors they engaged. This inevitably raised the overall project cost and hit CPSEs considerably at a time when they are scaling up RE projects.The issue was taken up by the ministry and discussed threadbare in rounds of inter-ministerial discussions held this year, as ET reported on April 9. Besides GFR Rule 144(xi), the government has also been discussing various public procurement orders of 2017 issued by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) on similar issues raised by other ministries.Apart from the registration process under GFR Rule 144, registration of sub-contractors, transfer of technology exemptions, classification of suppliers/bidder, registration need for procuring raw material were among other prickly issues that have emerged under this tighter procurement regime.DPIIT, in fact, has been making a series of amendments in the 2017 procurement orders to address some of these.",

        "articleBody": "Earlier this month, the European Union parliament declared nuclear power and natural gas as 'green energy' and investments in these sectors as climate friendly. These new rules will pave the way for gas and nuclear power plants in Europe as the continent struggles to make itself independent of Russian gas. However, on the other side of the Atlantic, New York City\u2019s biggest natural gas-fired power plant is set to close and reopen as a clean energy transmission and storage hub.It is interesting how the carbon dioxide emitting natural gas plant is considered 'green' in one developed region but not green in another one. The radioactive waste generating nuclear power plant also isn\u2019t exactly green but is relatively greener than fossil fuels. To be sure, for some countries, energy security takes precedence over being green while for some others, going green and clean is a path to attaining energy security. For instance, Japan is re-starting ten coal-fired power plants and as many old nuclear plants as possible to ease concerns of a possible power crunch in the country this winter. While here in India, the government plans to introduce amendments to the Energy Conservation Act in the Parliament\u2019s monsoon session to provide for mandatory use of clean energy, including green hydrogen.These contrasting scenarios highlight the problem with the world going green today - wherein governments, companies, multilateral institutions and hedge funds all are gearing up to paint their worlds green (at least figuratively). Incidentally, what is \u2018green\u2019 is subjective based on the time, place, and context. And this subjectivity gets further accentuated if there are pressing circumstances like a war in the neighbourhood, political compulsions, and an unforeseen event like a pandemic. It also depends on whether it\u2019s a bull market or a bear one.And on the other side of the greening efforts are the victims that face severe and immediate consequences of the governments suddenly clamping down on emissions. For instance, Sri Lanka\u2019s ill-founded experiment to go organic in its agriculture (by banning chemical fertilisers) accentuated the country\u2019s economic crisis and had to be aborted. The ban nevertheless managed to adversely impact the country\u2019s production of tea \u2013 a key export item for the island nation. Thousands of farmers in the Netherlands are busy protesting the country\u2019s plan to slash emissions of damaging pollutants - nitrogen oxide and ammonia - produced by livestock by 50% by 2030. These plans will likely force them to cut their livestock herds or stop work altogether.A radical and hastened approach towards going green and clean may not work \u2013 especially when it is the question of livelihoods. Can a group be expected to worry about the future if its present is under jeopardy? Besides, efforts towards going green cost money upfront. Stakeholders in poor nations may not have the same wherewithal to make this transition easily.It's not just countries, but companies too have issues joining the \u2018go green\u2019 bandwagon. There are huge incentives for companies to go green \u2013 right from boosting sales to being seen to be doing good business. Earlier, companies that were vocal about how many trees they are planting to compensate for their polluting activities are now talking about \u2018net zero\u2019 commitment. The devil, of course, lies in the details of how these commitments are achieved. Consumers today are willing to pay more if they believe the products are more environment-friendly. And this often prompts businesses to adopt covert routes to greenwashing. From misleading advertising and packaging to deceptive product labelling to launching supposedly green funds \u2013 companies are finding novel ways of including the G ingredient in their business recipes. And there are hardly any regulations to deter them from doing so leaving the environment-conscious consumers and investors in a lurch.However, there is a gradual pushback coming from various quarters against arbitrary green initiatives or green washing. For instance, platforms like www.greenwash.com by the Changing Markets Foundation provide resources to consumers to recognise the variety of tactics companies use to greenwash. The US market regulator SEC is clamping down on investment funds that have floated misleading ESG funds. The EU has adopted the \u2018green taxonomy' framework to clarify which investments are environmentally sustainable with an aim to prevent greenwashing. These measures will take time to have a deterrence effect. Even then, it will be difficult for the world to adopt a common idea and colour of sustainability any time soon. For now, it\u2019s a green evolution rather than a green revolution.(Views are personal)",

        "articleBody": "Indonesia and India on Thursday underscored a call by emerging nations for more climate change financing, warning that rising energy prices due to the Ukraine war would make it difficult for countries to cut emissions.With inflation rising globally amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some countries, including in Europe, have reverted to coal and other fossil fuel-based power or delayed their energy transition out of concerns over affordability and supplies.India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and her Indonesian counterpart, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, said at a G20 event in Bali that emerging markets' energy transition should not come at high costs to the public.They both noted current high energy prices and Sri Mulyani said rising interest rates would also make it more expensive for emerging countries to raise funds for climate action. If we cannot pay and you cannot also help, then this is not going to be delivered,  she said, referring to Indonesia's plans to build renewable power sources and to phase out coal power plants.Indonesia and India, among the world's largest coal producers and users, have committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2060 and 2070 respectively.Rich nations have pledged to provide $100 billion per year from 2020 to help poorer countries tackle climate change, but have so far failed to meet the promised amount. The Group of Seven (G7) economies last month said they will be paying the full amount every year by 2023.A U.S. official said the private sector will have to augment government funds to meet the massive global need, noting that some $250 billion in assets were now available in private environmental, social and governance funds.Andy Baukol, acting undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury for international affairs, said his country had launched an inaugural $8.5 billion energy transition partnership with South Africa, and that further partnerships were now being set up by the G7 with India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Senegal. All of these partnerships are relatively new ... We think they have a lot of promise,  he said.",

India's Renewable Energy (RE) sector could potentially employ around 10 lakh people by 2030, which would be ten times more than the existing workforce of an estimated 1.1 lakh employed by the sector,  he said delivering the keynote address at an event on Renewable Energy Management for Cooperatives.  More than 90 per cent of RE projects have come up in rural areas, resulting in development of the rural economy, he said in a statement.  The programme is being organised by the Centre for International Cooperation and Training in Agriculture Banking (CICTAB) under the sponsorship of Ministry of Cooperation at VAMINICOM, Pune, Maharashtra.  Das stressed on the need to enhance capabilities of cooperative groups to understand the effects of climate change and environmental degradation, for them to play an important role in making India green through RE.  He also highlighted the several initiatives taken by the IREDA to boost the waste-to-energy segment.  For waste-to-energy projects, the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) has raised the exposure limit to 70 per cent of the project cost.  He also highlighted that farmers are benefiting from the PM-KUSUM scheme as part of major initiative towards making 'Annadata' also an 'Urjadata'.  The scheme aims to provide energy and water security to farmers, enhance their income, de-dieselise the farm sector and reduce environmental pollution. It is one of the largest initiatives in the world to provide clean energy to more than 35 lakh farmers by solarising their agriculture pumps.  The scheme is likely to generate employment opportunities equivalent to 7.55 lakh job-years for skilled and unskilled workers.  In his closing remarks, Das said e-mobility, green hydrogen, and offshore wind are expected to be game changers in the clean energy transition in the country in the next 5-7 years.",

Addressing an event organised by the Hydraulic Trailer Owners Association, the road transport and highways minister said the government is constructing tunnels worth Rs 2.5 lakh crore.   Our planning is to make electric highway from Delhi to Mumbai. Just like trolleybus, you can run trolleytrucks also,  he said, without providing more details.  A trolleybus is an electric bus that draws power from overhead wires. An electric highway generally refers to a road which supplies power to vehicles travelling on it, including through overhead power lines.  Gadkari further said his ministry has taken a decision to connect all districts by four-lane roads.  Noting that pollution is a big concern, Gadkari said,  I request heavy vehicle owners to use alternative fuel like ethanol, methanol and green hydrogen as they are cost effective and import substitutes.   The minister admitted that heavy vehicle owners are facing problems because of corruption in state Regional Transport Offices (RTOs).   So, we have to digitise all services provided by RTOs,  he added.  The minister said his aim to is to reduce road accidents and deaths. Observing that there is need to be cautious about road safety, he said  we need trained drivers .  The minister added that as a fast growing economy, India needs needs all kinds of transportation.  Gadkari also said logistics cost in India is high compare to that in China, European Union and the US.",

Without sharing a timeline of when he sees the transformation of the fleet happening, Fadnavis said big cities like Mumbai and Pune already have electric buses.   In the coming days, it will be our endeavour to ensure that public transport will not have any conventional fuel at all. We have already made a start with big cities in the state where transportation systems are being turned to clean systems,  Fadnavis said at an event organised by the Union Ministry of Culture and industry lobby CII here.  Fadnavis, who has been the chief minister of the state for a full five-year term in the past, said the state-run Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation will also be starting to replace the fuel source for its fleet soon.  Speaking at the maiden public outing for him and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde since taking oath last week, Fadnavis said a switch to EVs will help India achieve its overall environmental targets and also develop the electric vehicles ecosystem in the state.  The GSDP of the state will touch USD 1 trillion before 2030 on the back of the infrastructure, technology and innovation-led approach adopted by the government, he added.  He also said politics sometimes meddles in infrastructure creation like the Metro rail project in the financial capital, but made it clear that the government wants to fasten the pace of work and complete it on time.  Without naming the Vadhavan port off the Dahanu coast, Fadnavis said the government will also help facilitate progress on the port -- which has been facing environmental objections -- so as to help achieve the overall GSDP target.  Admitting that Maharashtra has lagged behind in progress on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, Fadnavis said efforts will be made to expedite the same.  Shinde said he and his deputy are currently thinking about reducing the value added tax (VAT) on fuels, as done by some other states.  He said multinationals are opening shop along the upcoming Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg, and claimed that farmers of the state will stop committing suicides once the highway along with 20 dedicated nodes for industry gets operational.  Shinde also spoke about a meeting of the national authority on industrial corridors chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and affirmed support to building dedicated corridors between Mumbai and other cities like Delhi, Bengaluru and Nagpur, and also parks for bulk drugs, textiles and medical devices.  Speaking at the same event, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari pointed to the sugarcane production in the state and urged the newly-installed state government to also work on alternative fuels like ethanol.  A recent study has proven that the calorific value of ethanol is the same as petrol, Gadkari said, adding that the cost per litre is also half and the damage to the environment is minimal.  Gadkari further said he has conceived a Rs 50,000-crore sea bridge project which will connect the Delhi-Mumbai expressway coming till JNPT with Vasai-Virar, which will greatly benefit Navi Mumbai. However, he asked the Maharashtra government for a waiver on state GST on the steel and cement so that the project can be started by his ministry.",

It has also recommended creating a fund by pooling resources from both public and private sectors to support CCUS projects.An official task force had earlier identified enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and enhanced coal-bed methane recovery (ECBMR) as initial pathways for the large-scale implementation of India\u2019s CCUS strategy.The draft has recommended exemption from cess and royalty for upstream players undertaking EOR projects using carbon dioxide injection and tax credit for industries engaged in carbon capture.ONGC has already identified an EOR project at its Gandhar field in Gujarat, which will use CO2 captured at and shipped from Indian Oil\u2019s Koyali refinery in the state. The draft has identified several reservoirs in Gujarat, Assam and other places for carbon storage.The report has also proposed hub and cluster networks to connect multiple emitters with storage locations through common transport infrastructure. \u201cThis will not only reduce costs and risks but also facilitate and encourage greater volumes of CO2 capture\u201d, the panel said, proposing Bharuch district in Gujarat as an \u201cideal\u201d location.The draft has recommended proper policy measures to address the long-term risk associated with the storage of CO2, which could migrate or leak out many years or decades after the operation is stopped.",

        "articleBody": "India must look at multiple technology options, including hybrids, to tackle carbon emissions and not just restrict to electric vehicles, a senior company official of Japanese auto major Toyota said on Friday. In May, the company announced plans to invest Rs 4,800 crore in Karnataka for local production of powertrain parts and other components of Electric Vehicles (EVs). It is preparing to develop an ecosystem for electrified vehicles in the country as part of its path towards carbon neutrality.   For India, we should have a diversified way to tackle carbon neutrality, not only BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle), not only A or B or C (technology). We have to tackle with A and B and C,  Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) Managing Director Masakazu Yoshimura told PTI in an interview.  To do so, he said,  We need to have a good rich resource of technology backup ... we need good skilled manpower supported by some investments of course, and the government support.   Yoshimura said all stakeholders must get together to decide what is best suited for India.  Considering the size of the country and its diverse industries, he said  each industry in India must also have their own strategy on how to tackle (carbon emissions).    Fortunately, we have now a very good government leading us to that diversified manner to tackle the carbon neutrality,  Yoshimura said, adding, although Toyota cannot provide all the technologies that suit the ideas that the government has provided, the company has some technologies that's already available in other parts of the world which can be used here.  When asked about the Indian government's push for EVs as compared to other technologies like hybrids, he said,  If India becomes a complete BEV oriented country, we will introduce our BEVs.   Last December, Toyota Motor Corporation had announced plans to launch 30 new BEV models globally by 2030.   We have BEVs and we can always introduce them (in India),  Yoshimura said.  When asked how soon the company can launch a full EV in India if the need arose, he said,  If it is CBU (Completely Built Unit), we can bring it, maybe, in six months minimum, perhaps, but it will have very less local content.   He further said,  If it is dedicated, uniquely designed for India, it will take two years.   Toyota has been investing significantly to create the ecosystem for EVs and not only just one technology but the entire range of electrified vehicles, whether it's an EV or a strong hybrid. The company's recent announcement of Rs 4,800 crore is towards advanced technologies.  It has also inaugurated one line that will manufacture e-drive, a major component that goes into any electrified technology, whether it's a BEV or a strong hybrid. It is trying to manufacture electrified vehicle powertrain parts in India in order to get to mass electrification.  When asked if Toyota is preparing for a big push towards electrification, Yoshimura said,  We have already prepared Toyota globally and TKM at the Bidadi site in Bangalore ... e-drive production line has already started production and will first start exporting to Japan and we will produce for the locally manufactured vehicles (including the Urban Cruiser Hyryder).   Stressing on the significance of hybrid vehicles, he said they offer 40-60 per cent better fuel efficiency compared to similar conventional engine vehicles.   It could immediately reduce the forex usage to buy the crude oil or any oil from Russia. It will save your expenditure as a nation immediately ... ,  he added.  TKM on Friday forayed into the highly competitive mid-size SUV segment with the unveiling of its latest hybrid model -- Urban Cruiser Hyryder, which is expected to hit the market in the upcoming festive season.  The Hyryder comes with two powertrains -- Neo Drive and Self-charging Strong Hybrid Electric powertrain and will compete with the likes of Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos, among others.  The auto major said it has commenced bookings for the model at its dealerships across the country for an amount of Rs 25,000.",

Recent years have witnessed a rapid embrace of ESG measures benchmarking in the APAC region, driven by the pressing need to reduce climate risks. In the past, adopting sustainable methods have shown to strengthen investment portfolios,\u201d said Neil Brookes, Head of Global Capital Markets at Knight Frank.According to him, with debt cost soaring, yield-seeking investors will also be compelled to move up the risk curve to secure the desired spreads. Many investors will gravitate to more active asset management strategies, in order to generate alpha.Four Indian cities including Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai have made it to the list of top-twenty sustainable cities as per the Asia-Pacific Sustainability Index 2021. Knight Frank\u2019s APAC Sustainably Led Cities Index rated 36 cities based on urbanisation pressure, climate risk, carbon emissions and government initiatives.\u201cNew market dynamics have propelled the growth of sustainable development in India. The global commitment to carbon neutrality and Net Zero is firmly focused on creating environmentally friendly premises has led Indian developers to augment their products to meet the requirements,\u201d said Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director Knight Frank India.With more and more occupiers demanding for sustainable, green and well standard buildings, Baijal expects these features to become a universal standard, rather than a novelty, in the foreseeable future.Bangalore has led the sustainability index amongst the top Indian cities and ranked 14th in the APAC region. Delhi ranked second amongst the Indian cities with its 17th rank in the APAC region followed by Hyderabad that stood 18th in the APAC region and Mumbai that ranked 20th in the APAC region. ",

This would translate into sales of 0.98 million units and 0.78 million units in financial years 2024 and 2031 respectively. The Aayog is of the view that a shift towards electric mobility is essential for India considering the high amount of petroleum imports, its adverse impact on the trade balance, valuable foreign exchange and the environment.

        "articleBody": "The Haryana government on Monday approved the State Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy 2022 offering several financial incentives to EV manufacturers. A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of the state cabinet which met here under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.  The EV policy offers various financial incentives to EV manufacturers by giving incentives on fixed capital investment (FCI), net SGST, stamp duty, employment generation, etc, an official statement said.  There is 100 per cent reimbursement of stamp duty along with exemption in electricity duty for a period of 20 years.  The SGST reimbursement shall be 50 per cent of the applicable net SGST for a period of 10 years. Companies manufacturing electric vehicles, components of electric vehicle, EV battery, charging infrastructure etc. shall be incentivized with capital subsidy.  Mega industry shall get capital subsidy at 20 per cent of FCI or Rs 20 crore whichever is lower; large industry will get subsidy of 10 per cent of FCI up to INR 10 crores, for medium industry 20 per cent of FCI upto Rs 50 lakh, for small industry 20 per cent of FCI up to Rs 40 lakh and for micro industry 25 per cent of FCI up to Rs 15 lakh.  Under this policy, units setting up batteries disposal units will get 15 per cent of FCI up to Rs 1 crore.  The policy provides for employment generation subsidy of Rs 48,000 per employee per annum for 10 years in lieu of Haryana domiciled manpower being employed with EV companies.  Efforts shall be made to convert 100 per cent of the bus fleet owned by Haryana State Transport Undertakings into electric buses or Fuel Cell Vehicles or other non- fossil-fuel-based technologies by 2030.  The cities of Gurugram & Faridabad will be declared as model Electric Mobility (EM) cities with phase-wise goals to adopt Electric Vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure to achieve 100 percent e-mobility.  In addition to this, the Department of Town and Country Planning (TCP) shall mandatorily include the provisions for charging of electric vehicles in places such as Group Residential buildings, commercial buildings, institutional buildings, Malls, Metro Station etc., for enabling the overall ecosystem for uptake of Electric Vehicles.  The year 2022 will be declared as  Year of the Electric Vehicles  in Haryana.  The EV Policy aims to protect the environment, reduce carbon footprint, make Haryana an EV manufacturing hub, ensure skill development in EV field, encourage uptake of EV vehicles, provide EV charging infrastructure and encourage R&D in EV technology.  The policy provides one time support to facilitate conversion of existing manufacturers units completely into EV manufacturing of 25 per cent of book value up to Rs 2 crore for Micro, Small, Medium and Large units.  The cost of an electric vehicle is comparatively higher than conventional-fuel-based vehicles which is a major deterrent to buyers in switching to EV, said the statement.  The policy offers incentives to buyers that would reduce the effective upfront cost and motivate individuals to take up electric vehicles as their primary mode for transportation.  The policy will provide early bird direct benefit transfer up to Rs 10 lakh on purchase of Electric Vehicles or Hybrid electric Vehicles in the state. Buyers will also be eligible for relaxation in registration fee and discount on Motor Vehicle Tax.  The policy encourages R&D in educational or research institutes if they setup R&D centers.  The policy will promote Research & Development in the field of EVs by granting 50 per cent of project cost up to Rs 1 crore for developing new electric charging technology and up to Rs 5 crore for developing new electric vehicle technology.  Institutes conducting dedicated research on non-fossil-fuel based mobility solution will be provided with Rs 5 crore grant. One time subsidy of Rs 25 Lakh shall be extended to first 20 colleges/Industrial Training Institutes / polytechnics for setting up infrastructure related to R&D of EV.  Government organizations, PSUs, private companies shall be encouraged to set up Centre of Excellences (CoE) that shall be incentivized with a 50 per cent grant of project cost up to Rs 5 crore.",

        "articleBody": "Every year in October, cash registers ring in shops dotting east India's mining hubs during the Hindu festival season of Dussehra, when the country's biggest coal company, Coal India Ltd., hands its workers a bonus. Researchers and unions are calling for this coal cash - which fuels spending in homes and local economies - and the revenue local governments earn from coal mining firms to be mapped as a first step towards planning for a post-coal economy. India is aiming to more than triple its renewable energy capacity by 2030 - but state support for renewables projects is still a fraction of that for fossil fuels, as coal production is also being ramped up to meet rising energy demand. Researchers are calling for a large increase in spending on renewable energy to help ensure that coal mining communities do not lose out as India shifts to a more climate-friendly economy.  India needs to go back to the drawing board to map its financial challenges as it transitions to green,  Prateek Aggarwal, programme associate with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  In coal-dependent economies, a majority of the expenditure depends on coal revenue. And these states need to diversify - for where will they get the money from for the state's development and social welfare?  said Aggarwal. He co-authored a report released in May - Mapping India's Energy Policy 2022, which shows that coal continues to enjoy more investment and state subsidies than renewables and argues that the balance needs to be tilted towards clean energy. A phase-down of India's coal production and use in the future is inevitable, policy experts said, calling on the country to immediately begin planning for alternative industries and building renewable energy capacity. Kavita Rao, director of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a think-tank, said coal in India would not disappear for another three decades, so jobs may be protected for now, but that will not last as the sector stops expanding.  Our challenge is gross energy production - and if we move to solar and other sources of energy incrementally, a just transition can be managed,  she added. FOLLOW THE MONEY India, the world's number-two coal producer, aims to build 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030, up from about 150GW now, and has pledged to reach net-zero climate-heating emissions by 2070. It is betting heavily on large solar and wind projects to meet these targets, incentivising investments and launching water and energy security schemes to phase out fossil-fuel use in the farming sector. But to achieve its 2030 goal, India needs to invest $20 billion-$27 billion per year in renewable energy, double what it is now spending, according to the renewable energy ministry. While the government cut coal subsidies to $1.7 billion last year from $3 billion in 2014, they are still higher than support for renewables, which stood at about $1 billion last year, up from $0.6 billion in 2014, said the study Aggarwal co-authored. But what the state gets back for its investment is a big barrier to change. More than 80% of India's total energy revenue of about $94 billion - mainly in the form of taxes and duties - comes from oil and gas, followed by coal and electricity at about 16%, while less than 1% comes from renewable energy sources, calculations in the new report show. Coal mine closures will have a cascading effect on local economies and services such as health and education. Surendra Pandey, all-India secretary of the Delhi-based labour union Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, called for a  just transition law  that would give workers the right to compensation following mine closures.  Coal India should increase investments in solar power in these regions, but currently their focus is on beefing up coal production,  he said, referring to India's recent decision to increase coal capacity to meet growing energy demand spurred by a severe heatwave. India's plan to reopen shut mines and open new mines to increase domestic coal production to 1.2 billion metric tonnes from about 780 million tonnes now is out of step with long-term climate-related risks, researchers said.  The decision to invest in coal expansion means that already limited public resources will be used to fund a mature technology that has clear negative impacts on the environment, people's health and the planet,  said Swasti Raizada, co-author of the Mapping Energy Policy report. Moreover, coal-fired power projects will become stranded assets as the world adopts clean energy, said Raizada, policy advisor at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. A BEGINNING Conversations around just transition are only now starting in India - and the subject is often dismissed as premature in the corridors of thermal power and coal production firms. But a beginning of sorts has been made: the federal coal ministry is conducting ground surveys of two mining districts to plan a socially fair shift away from coal - which union leader Pandey said must be expanded soon to cover all 290 shut mines. Officials at Coal India - which accounts for almost 80% of the country's coal production - also met labour unions and researchers in a rare interaction on just transition this month. Describing the gathering as a  historic milestone , professor Pradip Swarnakar, who heads the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur's Just Transition Research Centre, said everyone accepted a green energy shift was on the cards.  Even if coal ends in the next five or 20 or 30 years, we have to work from today - otherwise it will be disastrous like the tsunami,  said Swarnakar. Coal India officials told the Thomson Reuters Foundation they were mindful of both direct and indirect reliance on coal in mining hubs. Vinay Ranjan, Coal India's director of personnel and industrial relations, who participated in the just transition dialogue, said the firm was looking at re-skilling workers to prepare them for other industries or evergreen jobs such as welders and electricians. Coal India, he added, understands that multiple layers of workers, their families and local businesses depend on coal.  During Dussehra, shopkeepers wait for the bonus that our employees will get as they buy new clothes. This is a big festival and the happiest people during this time are the shopkeepers,  he said. ",

        "articleBody": "India will need $223 billion of investment to meet its goal of wind and solar capacity installations by 2030, according to a new report by research company BloombergNEF (BNEF). The government has set a target of increasing non-fossil power capacity to 500 GW by 2030. It wants non-fossil fuel power sources to provide half of its electricity supply by 2030.  To achieve this target, India needs to massively scale up funding for renewables,  the report said, adding that $223 billion is required over the next eight years just to meet the solar and wind capacity targets. At COP26 in November 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India plans to reduce emission intensity by more than 45 per cent by 2030 to below 2005 levels. He also announced a net-zero by 2070 target. The report 'Financing India's 2030 Renewables Ambition', published in association with the Power Foundation of India, found that corporate commitments from Indian companies could help India achieve 86 per cent of its 2030 goals of building 500GW of cumulative non-fossil power generation capacity, a statement issued by BNEF said. By 2021, 165 GW of zero-carbon generation had already been installed in the country. Central Electricity Authority forecasts that the country's reliance on coal to drop from 53 per cent of installed capacity in 2021 to 33 per cent in 2030, whereas solar and wind together make up 51 per cent by then, up from 23 per cent in 2021. Shantanu Jaiswal, lead author of the report and head of India research at BloombergNEF, said:  To date, the growth of renewable energy in India has been funded by a diverse set of financiers. Debt and equity structures have evolved as the market grew and new risks emerged. India's ambitious renewable energy targets now require further scaling up of financing with new instruments and learnings from other global markets . Yet, the scaling up of renewables in India faces regulatory, project and financing risks, with PPA renegotiation, land acquisition and payment delays cited as key risks by industry stakeholders surveyed by BloombergNEF. In the short-term, rising interest rates, a depreciating rupee and high inflation create challenges for the financing of renewables.  Scaling up financing to meet 2030 goals requires Independent Power Producers to tap into new or underutilised sources of capital. These could be revolving construction debt, investment infrastructure trusts and funding from retail investors, insurance companies and pension funds.  Higher funding requirements also need measures that can increase the availability of financing, such as de-risking renewable projects to offering contractual terms that provide greater comfort to investors,  Rohit Gadre, an analyst in BNEF's India research team, commented.",

        "articleBody": "Despite the promise of a worldwide green recovery in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, this historic opportunity has been lost, says a report, but India ranked third globally for total renewable power capacity additions with 15.4 GW in 2021, following only China (136 GW) and the US (43 GW).REN21's Renewables 2022 Global Status Report (GSR 2022) sends a clear warning that the global clean energy transition is not happening, making it unlikely that the world will be able to meet critical climate goals this decade.The second half of 2021 saw the beginning of the biggest energy crisis in modern history, exacerbated by the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 and unprecedented global commodity shock. Although many more governments committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2021, the reality is that, in response to the energy crisis, most countries have gone back to seeking out new sources of fossil fuels and to burning even more coal, oil and natural gas,  said Rana Adib, REN21 Executive Director.According to the report, India added 843 MW of hydropower capacity in 2021, raising the total capacity to 45.3 GW.India was the second largest market in Asia for new solar PV capacity and third globally (13 GW of additions in 2021). It ranked fourth for total installations (60.4 GW), overtaking Germany (59.2 GW) for the first time.India ranked third globally for the total installed capacity of wind power (40.1 GW), behind China, the US and Germany.The GSR annually takes stock of renewable energy deployment worldwide. The 2022 report, released on Wednesday, is the 17th consecutive edition and provides proof of what experts have been warning about: the overall share of renewables in the world's final energy consumption has stagnated -- rising only minimally from 10.6 per cent in 2009 to 11.7 per cent in 2019 -- and the global shift of the energy system to renewables is not happening.In the electricity sector, record additions in renewable power capacity (314.5 gigawatts, up 17 per cent from 2020) and generation (7,793 terawatt-hours) were unable to meet the overall increase in electricity consumption of six per cent.In heating and cooling, the renewable share in final energy consumption increased from 8.9 per cent in 2009 to 11.2 per cent in 2019.In the transport sector, where the renewable share went from 2.4 per cent in 2009 to 3.7 per cent in 2019, the lack of progress is particularly worrying, as the sector accounts for nearly a third of global energy consumption.For the first time, the GSR 2022 provides a world map of renewable energy shares by country and highlights progress in some of the leading countries.Despite many new commitments to net zero, political momentum has not translated into action.In the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November 2021, a record 135 countries pledged to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.However, only 84 of these countries had economy-wide targets for renewable energy, and only 36 had targets for 100 per cent renewables.For the first time in the history of UN climate summits, the COP26 declaration mentioned the need to reduce coal use, but it failed to call for targeted reductions in either coal or fossil fuels.The GSR 2022 makes clear that meeting countries' net zero pledges will require massive efforts, and that the momentum associated with Covid-19 has passed untapped.Despite important green recovery measures in many countries, the strong economic rebound in 2021 -- with global real gross domestic product (GDP) growing 5.9 per cent -- contributed to a four per cent rise in final energy consumption, offsetting the growth of renewables.In China alone, final energy consumption rose 36 per cent between 2009 and 2019. Most of the increase in global energy use in 2021 was met by fossil fuels, resulting in the largest surge in carbon dioxide emissions in history, up more than 2 billion tonnes worldwide.The collapse of the old energy order threatens the global economy. The year 2021 also marked the end of the era of cheap fossil fuels, with the largest spike in energy prices since the 1973 oil crisis.By the end of the year, gas prices reached around 10 times the 2020 levels in Europe and Asia and tripled in the US, leading to a spike in wholesale electricity prices in major markets by the end of 2021.Russia's invasion of Ukraine deeply aggravated the unfolding energy crisis, causing an unprecedented commodity shockwave that weighed heavily on global economic growth, rattling the more than 136 countries that are reliant on fossil fuel imports.",

        "articleBody": "Britain on Tuesday axed its \u00a31,500 ($1,800) subsidy for buyers of new plug-in cars as it focuses on other types of electric vehicles, but the news drew anger from the auto sector.  The government is today closing the plug-in car grant scheme to new orders after successfully kickstarting the UK's electric car revolution,  the Department for Transport (DfT) said in a statement. The grant was launched in 2011 to help encourage Britons to ditch high-polluting diesel and petrol cars. It has since supported the sale of almost half a million electric cars, the DfT added, stressing that the subsidy was always a  temporary  policy. Sales of fully electric cars rocketed from less than 1,000 in 2011 to almost 100,000 vehicles in the first five months of this year alone. However, the government is now switching its focus to offer subsidies on sales of new plug-in electric taxis, motorcycles, vans, trucks and wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Britain plans to ban new sales of diesel and petrol cars in the UK from 2030, as part of its goal to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Tuesday's announcement drew stark criticism from industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT).  The decision to scrap the plug-in car grant sends the wrong message to motorists and to an industry which remains committed to government's net zero ambition,  said SMMT boss Mike Hawes.  Whilst we welcome government's continued support for new electric van, taxi and adapted vehicle buyers, we are now the only major European market to have zero upfront purchase incentives for EV car buyers.  Britain's automobile sector had stalled last year on pandemic fallout including a semiconductor shortage. However, greener electric vehicles now account for one in six new car sales. That rises to just over half of all new car sales, if hybrid vehicles are included.",

        "articleBody": "The Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL), a Government of India Public Sector Undertaking engaged in the creation of EV Charging Infrastructure in the country, has written to the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM) highlighting shortcomings in the tender for setting up EV charging station at government-owned locations in Bengaluru urban district under BESCOM jurisdiction. \u201cWe consider the availability of EV Charging Infrastructure to be the most critical factor in faster adoption of EVs in India so as to meet our national targets fixed for the period up to 2030. While we appreciate BESCOM's initiatives to expeditiously establish the requisite infrastructure of EV charging stations, there are apparent glaring shortcomings in the present tender that are unsound on technical grounds and fail to inspire confidence in the prospective bidders on the objectivity of the selection process,\u201d BECIL has said in the letter.According to the letter, the notice mentions 24th May 2022 as the start date, the tender document was, however, published online on 27th May 2022 (evening time after 5:00pm) only. \u201cThis shows that only one day was given to submit all bid clarification documents (28th May 2022). As this date also falls on the fourth Saturday of the month, which is not a working day in most parts of the country,\u201d the letter reads. A senior BESCOM official said that the date to apply for tender has been extended till June 17 as many prospective bidders had raised objections.\u201cThe conditions set in the tender have been decided by the committee as per the provisions of government. The BECIL letter was received by senior officials and they have responded to it,\u201d the official said.As per the letter, as many as 31 tenders were published on the same day, which required close study and analysis for a prospective bidder to submit well-thought-out bid queries.\u201cA period of only 10 days from the date of online publishing of the tender online has been allowed for bidding for all the 31 districts, which is grossly inadequate, particularly keeping in view the fact that the prospective bidders had only one day to prepare for the pre-bid meeting,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cBECIL strongly feels that such a haste will compromise the intended objectives, which are so important for the Prime Minister's vision of EV infrastructure in the country and an important state like Karnataka,\u201d the officer said in the letter. BECIL has also highlighted that contrary to the government's policy of giving a boost to the MSME sector and the start-ups, the tender documents do not provide any relaxations in technical qualifications. \u201cAs you would know, the EV Charging Infrastructure is a newly formed industry that has attracted a number of startups. These startups are crucial for technological development and introducing innovative solutions in the sector,\u201d the letter reads. BECIL has also said that turnover requirements of the tender depart away from normal practice wherein Rs 9.08 crore turnover is asked for in any 2 of last preceding 5 years instead of the average turnover concept. \u201cSuch a requirement handicaps the startup and MSME companies who are unlikely to meet these financial stipulations, as this industry is new and still in infancy,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWe are constrained to mention that the present tender seriously violates many Governmental guidelines, both Central and the State, some of which have been highlighted,\u201d BECIL said.",

Last year, the government had announced imposing 40 per cent BCD on solar modules and 25 per cent on solar cells with effect from April 1, 2022.  Singh said as a result of the duty, the domestic manufacturing capacity of modules and cells has started going up.  However, developers of renewable energy projects have been raising concerns that the domestic capacity is not enough to meet their needs of modules and cells, and were expecting relief from the government.  When asked about plans of reviewing the decision to impose duty, the Minister replied:  By and large this will remain. I don't want any Chinese imports. No plans (of reviewing the decision or modifying it).   According to research firm Mercom India Research, the domestic module manufacturing capacity was around 18-20 GW as of March 2022.",

        "articleBody": "The Nitish Kumar government in Bihar has reached out to the Centre to seek removal of the state-specific quota on production of ethanol as it has the capacity to produce more than its allocated share due to high availability of maize and rice husk. The state has also come out with a comprehensive industrial promotion policy for textile and leather based on relevant data and studies in the last nine months.Nitish Kumar demanded twice in his speech on Wednesday in Patna at the release of the textile and leather investment promotion policy that the Centre should not bind Bihar within a quota for production of ethanol. This quota for states is based on its consumption of ethanol. Kumar had reportedly also expressed his concern to Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, a keen enthusiast of the use of ethanol, and suggested Bihar\u2019s quota be increased.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had mentioned on June 5 during a programme to celebrate World Environment Day that India has reached its goal of blending 10% ethanol in petrol and this was done five months before schedule.Bihar Industries Minister Shahnawaz Hussain said here on Thursday that the state has a proposal for Rs 30,000 Crore for this sector. Bihar has set plans for 17 ethanol plants of which one is already functional. One of the plants has run into some problems while 15 are under construction.91265109The state is trying to woo investors with proposals that promise ease of doing business through ready availability of labour, skilled workers, land, raw materials for sectors like food processing, textile and leather industry.Hussain told reporters that the 2016 industrial policy had some shortcomings as other states scored over Bihar. The 2022 investment promotion policy for leather and textile has been formulated after perusing data collected post Covid and includes the feedback from migrants who had returned to the state.Among the incentives offered to investors is Rs 10 Crore capital subsidy, employment generation subsidy of Rs 5000 per month for highly skilled, power tariff subsidy of Rs 2 per unit, and the state bearing 50% of the cost of patent registration.\u201cDon\u2019t look at Bihar from the old perspective. Come to Bihar to invest,\u201d Hussain said, adding that law and order, infrastructure and power situation has improved under Nitish Kumar.Improved air connectivity from small cities of Bihar and the presence of two highway corridors will also help the state in exporting its products.The state also has the wherewithal for promoting the food processing industry and is promoting it in a big way.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s plan to remove millions of older polluting cars from its roads in an effort to clear some of the world\u2019s most toxic air looks set to face several challenges with a new survey showing the majority of vehicle owners aren\u2019t interested in trading in their automobile based on age.Some 57% of 10,543 vehicle owners surveyed by LocalCircles say whether a car should be removed from service or not should depend on miles on the odometer rather than age. The government last year mandated that personal vehicles more than 20 years old and commercial vehicles more than 15 years old will need to undergo fitness tests in order to remain on the road.In addition, just over half of consumers surveyed said they\u2019re planning to reduce the number of cars they own because they believe India\u2019s cash-for-clunkers policy will make it more expensive to keep an old vehicle. Authorities have made auto fitness tests more expensive since April, with owners of cars that are older than 15 years now having to spend eight times more to renew their registration.The public\u2019s lack of interest in getting rid of polluting vehicles is a potential setback for India\u2019s ambitions to turn net carbon zero by 2070. Recycling old cars is crucial for India to cut emissions considering the take up of electric vehicles is lagging due to sparse charging networks and the high price of battery-powered transport. The nation\u2019s Centre for Science and Environment forecasts that by 2025, India will have as many as 20 million old vehicles nearing the end of their lives, causing huge environmental damage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration has said it expects the program to attract fresh investment of more than 100 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) and curb the nation\u2019s dependency on other countries for metals. Modi has said scrapping end-of-life vehicles in India is currently not productive because precious metals aren\u2019t recycled and the energy recovery is close to nothing.Automakers however appear to be siding with the public.\u201cAge is not a good criteria for scrapping a vehicle,\u201d Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. Chairman R.C. Bhargava said in an interview. \u201cThe logic has to be the car\u2019s ability to ply roads safely so it doesn\u2019t put other road users in danger. A vehicle gets scrapped when the user finds it isn\u2019t economical to repair it to get a fitness certificate.\u201d Personal vehicles should undergo fitness tests every three years at least, Bhargava said. In India, when a car goes on the road there\u2019s typically no further inspection to check whether safety standards that were prescribed at the time of sale are being met. A large number of accidents happen because of defects in vehicles that aren\u2019t periodically certified as fit, he said.India also needs more large scrapping centers with recycling currently dominated by informal small-scale units. Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Tsusho Corp. have jointly set up a facility with an investment of 440 million rupees to scrap and recycle over 24,000 end-of-life vehicles annually. Mahindra MSTC Recycling Pvt., which has a recycling facility in Pune, is building four more scrapping units in the western state of Maharashtra with a capacity of 40,000 vehicles annually.",

        "articleBody": "The government on Tuesday said it has notified the Green Open Access Rules 2022 to further accelerate India's renewable energy programmes. These rules are notified for promoting generation, purchase and consumption of green energy including through waste-to-energy plants. It enables a simplified procedure for the open access to green power, the power ministry said in a statement.   In order to further accelerate our ambitious renewable energy programmes, with the end goal of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and green energy for all, Green Open Access Rules 2022 have been notified on June 6, 2022,  the ministry said.  Consumers can now demand green power from discoms (power distribution companies), it said, adding,  Every consumer becomes stakeholder to contribute in achieving India's commitment of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel by 2030.   As per the rules, the green open access is allowed to any consumer and the limit of open access transaction has been reduced from 1 MW (megawatt) to 100 kW for green energy in order to enable small consumers also to purchase renewable power through open access.  There will be transparency in the approval process of the open access applications. As per the rules, the approvals are to be granted in 15 days or else it will be deemed to have been approved subject to fulfilment of technical requirements. It will be through a national portal.  On the tariff, the statement said:  The tariff for the green energy shall be determined separately by the appropriate commission, which shall comprise of the average pooled power purchase cost of the renewable energy, cross-subsidy charges, if any, and service charges covering the prudent cost of the distribution licensee for providing the green energy to the consumers.   The rules will help streamline the overall approval process for granting open access, including timely approval, to improve predictability of cash flows for renewable power producers. It will also bring uniformity in the application procedure.  The rules provide certainty on open access charges to be levied on green energy open access consumers, which includes transmission charges, wheeling charges, cross-subsidy surcharge and standby charges.  Cap on increasing the cross-subsidy surcharge as well as the removal of additional surcharge not only incentivises the consumers to go green but also addresses the issues that have hindered the growth of open access in India.  Consumers will be given certificates if they consume green power. Cross subsidy surcharge and additional surcharge shall not be applicable, if green energy is utilised for production of green hydrogen and green ammonia.  Besides, there shall be a uniform renewable purchase obligation on all obligated entities in the area of a distribution licensees.",

Biden's administration will also invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to accelerate domestic production, and use the federal government's purchasing power to increase demand, a fact sheet said. China is excluded as the Commerce Department investigates whether certain Chinese companies are circumventing US customs duties by assembling parts in the four countries.  Today's clean energy technologies are a critical part of the arsenal we must harness to lower energy costs for families, reduce risks to our power grid, and tackle the urgent crisis of a changing climate,  the White House said. It added that, compared to when Biden took office, the US was on track to triple domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 2024, from 7.5 gigawatts to 22.5 gigawatts, enough to enable 3.3 million homes to switch to solar each year. Monday's actions include invoking the DPA to force the manufacture of clean energy in key areas including solar parts like photovoltaic modules and module components. Former president Donald Trump previously used the same powers during the Covid pandemic to increase production of medicines and equipment, and it was also invoked during World War II. The two-year tariff suspension window meanwhile is intended as a  bridge  to ensure the United States has access to sufficient supply of parts to meet electricity generation needs while domestic capacity scales up.",

For environmentally cleaner transportation of coal, Coal India (CIL) is setting up coal handling plant/silos in 35 projects under the first phase of the first-mile connectivity, and stressed that it is continuing in the second phase as well.   The company is also aiming at green mining options and planning to increase its underground output,  he said.  Stating that CIL is committed to preservation of environment and creating a green canopy around its mining areas, the chairman said that the public sector unit planted over 30.4 lakh saplings during FY22, expanding its green cover to 1,468.5 hectares.  The chairman said that 27 eco parks and mine tourism projects have been developed as on date.  Satellite surveillance indicates that 76 major open-cast projects have reclaimed 62.5 per cent of excavated area limiting active mining area to 37.5 per cent.  For every hectare of land degraded due to mining, CIL created green cover of around 2 hectares of land.  Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.",

Both countries are keen to announce the partnership at the G7 Summit, where India has been invited, later this month.The idea, sources said, is to devise an India-specific \u2018Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)\u2019 taking into account India\u2019s position on ensuring climate justice while addressing climate change challenges as well as its commitments on increasing the share of renewable sources in its energy mix. The G7 already has a similar $8.5 billion transition plan with South Africa, which has stated its intent to decommission coal-based power plants in lieu for lower emission alternatives.The JETP paper for India, which is currently under consideration of the government, has suggested a two-phased approach. In the first phase, the focus would be on reducing India\u2019s \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d by deploying renewable energy in power generation. This would mean specific investments on modernisation of power grids, deploying energy storage besides introducing new green technology.Also, the G7 has pushed the envelope on rolling back thermal plants currently in the development stage and gradually shutting down coal mines. Specifically, it has suggested that if India is agreeable, then \u201cphase one could include reduction of the pipeline of coal-fired power plants currently under development\u2026 piloting just transition elements, such as coal-fired power plant conversion and coal mine closure\u201d. 92024690Besides this, it\u2019s proposed that targeted efforts be made in this phase to \u201cincrease production of green hydrogen and ammonia for industrial energy use\u201d while improving \u201cenergy efficiency across the power, transport, industry, and buildings sectors\u201d.In the second phase, the G7 has suggested that it would make additional efforts to \u201cwiden support across a wider range of areas, including industrial and transportation decarbonisation needs\u201d.ET has reliably gathered that the larger objective is to pool together resources of willing G7 partners and multilateral development banks, then put out a statement through the Elmau political declaration followed by an \u201cinvestment and policy plan to identify key opportunities, projects, and activities\u201d.The G7 proposal, sources said, has described the partnership as one based on \u201ctrust and strategic cooperation\u201d with an ambitious energy transition plan, which will recognize a need for India to \u201caccelerate a just energy transition towards decarbonisation to reduce their dependence on fossil-based energy generation\u201d.",

        "articleBody": "Ahmedabad, Gujarat has set a target to reduce carbon emissions from energy production to 139 million tonnes by 2030 by raising its installed capacity of renewable energy to 68,000 MW over the next eight years, a state government official said on Sunday. A release said the state reduced its carbon emissions by about 115 per cent in 2022 as compared to 2017, mainly due to an increase in the installed capacity of renewable energy in power generation. The reduction in carbon emissions from renewable energy in Gujarat was 12.08 million tonnes in 2017-18, which increased to 26.01 million tonnes, or around 115 per cent in 2021-22, the Gujarat government said in the release issued on the occasion of World Environment Day.  Gujarat's energy department has decided to reduce carbon emissions from energy production to 139 million tonnes by 2030. To this end, the state government will increase the installed capacity of renewable energy to 68,000 MW by 2030,  it said.  Carbon emission from thermal power in the state has been steadily declining in the last five years. This has been achieved due to the incentive given by the state government to promote renewable energy,  the release informed. In 2017-18, the share of renewable energy (with hydro energy) in the installed capacity of power generation in Gujarat was 29 per cent with 8,065 MW, which increased to 42 per cent in 2021-22 with the contribution of 17,367 MW, it said. At present, Gujarat ranks second in the country in terms of installed capacity of renewable energy, as per the release.  Due to the gradual increase in the installed capacity of renewable energy in the last five years, energy units produced by conventional electricity have been replaced with renewable energy,  the government said. The release quoted Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) general manager Sailaja Vachharajani as saying Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel has instructed departments to ensure the state's contribution is highest in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pledge for India to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Sunday that India has achieved the target of 10 per cent ethanol blending in petrol five months before deadline. Making the announcement at a programme on the 'Save Soil Movement', which coincided with the World Environment Day, Modi cited a number of measures taken by his government to protect the environment, saying its efforts have been multi-dimensional despite the country having a negligible role in climate change.The rise in ethanol blending in petrol from two per cent in 2014 to 10 per cent now has reduced carbon emission by 27 lakh tonnes and saved Rs 41,000 crore of forex reserve. This has also brought Rs 40,000 crore of income to farmers, he added.The National Biofuel Policy, introduced in 2018 aims at reducing the dependence on imports by relying on fuel blending. With bioethanol, biodiesel and bio CNG main fuels in focus, it includes the Ethanol Blending Programme (EPB), which includes the production of second generation ethanol (derived from forest and agricultural residues), which also increases the capacity to produce fuel additives, R&D in feedstock, which is the starting material for ethanol production, and financial incentives for achieving these goals.According to the report released by the  Expert Committee on Roadmap for Ethanol Blending in India by 2025 , 20% ethanol blending is within reach. The report further stated the annual plan for gradually rolling out the E20 ethanol in India. It also suggests the specific responsibilities of Union Ministries, State Governments and vehicle manufacturers for the production, supply and gradual rollout of 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025.The report also mentions the various benefits of ethanol blending on the environment. The immense benefits can accrue to the country by 20% ethanol blending by 2025, such as saving Rs 30,000 crore of foreign exchange per year, energy security, lower carbon emissions, better air quality, self-reliance, use of damaged food grains, increasing farmers' incomes, employment generation, and greater investment opportunities.In his address, the prime minister said India has also achieved its goal of having 40 per cent of its installed power generation from non-fossil fuel-based sources nine years before the deadline.The 'Save Soil Movement' is a global initiative to increase awareness about deteriorating soil health and bring about a conscious response to improve it, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) had said in a statement.",

        "articleBody": "As India races to increase its share of renewable energy as part of its ambitious climate action, experts on Monday underscored the need for the entire renewable energy (RE) spectrum to ensure energy equity, ecological responsibility and livelihood protection of the vulnerable communities during the energy transition from fossil-fuel.It is part of the 'Vision and Principles' released by the Responsible Energy India (REI) that seeks a socially just, ecologically safe, and rights respecting renewable energy sector as the country aims to achieve 500 GW of installed RE capacity by 2030. As the renewable energy sector grows exponentially, fuelled by an urgent need to meet peoples' energy needs cost-effectively and address the planet's climate emergency, it is essential that the RE sector and its allied industries act responsibly. We all need to act in ways that address energy equity, participatory governance, protect the livelihoods and ecosystems of places where RE is sited, and ensure that the full lifecycle of the RE system is safe and secure,  Ajay Mathur, Director General, International Solar Alliance (ISA), said as he released the 'Vision and Principles'.The Responsible Energy Initiative (REI) is a consortium of core and expert partners; alongside participants from across the RE value chain, its core partners for India are the The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), World Resources Institute, India (WRI India), and the Forum for the Future. A group of 26 global and Indian leaders from across the renewable energy sector and leading international think tanks contributed to the aVision and Principles.'By encouraging collaboration across wide-ranging stakeholders, REI seeks to urgently galvanise action to address concerns over the loss of traditional livelihoods; threats to community wellbeing; long-term ecological impacts on altering land use patterns; and complaints over energy equity. This comes at a time when the very existence of Great Indian Bustard (GIB) has been threatened because of the RE plants in Rajasthan and there have been reports of clashes between traditional local communities and RE companies at multiple locations.Asked about the engagement with the government vis-a-vis regulations needed in connection with these issues, Anna Biswas, Director, Forum for the Future India, told IANS,  Some of the officials in the relevant ministries are aware of what we have been doing. Our framework just got ready, and it is only now that we can take it to the government. The release of REI's 'Vision and Principles' was followed by a discussion on the current state of the RE sector in India with several participants from the private sector expressing their views. REI is a multi-year programme to ensure renewable energy in Asia achieves its full potential and creates value in a way that is ecologically safe, rights-respecting and socially just.",

We will be investing \u20b96,000 crore in the renewable segment in three years, and another \u20b920,000 crore by 2030, which is contingent upon certain technical aspects on the hydrogen front that the company is working out,  said Manoj Jain, chairman and managing director, Gail.The company has undertaken liquid hydrogen capacity addition and the progress done on the prototype will influence its overall investments, a call on which will be taken after 18 months.At present, Gail is in the process of procuring a 10 mw facility for liquid hydrogen, which would be the largest in the country, and is on the lookout for an electrolyser.Jain said the company is looking at 1 gw of renewable capacity over the next three years, but from a long-term perspective, coupled with green hydrogen, it is looking at 3 gw for renewable capacity. By 2030, around 50,000 tonnes per annum of hydrogen will be available, of which 35,000 tpa will be subject to how things pan out after 18 months,  Jain said, adding that 10% of Gail's portfolio should be hydrogen plus renewable by 2030.Rakesh Kumar Jain, director (finance), said the company has outlined a capital expenditure plan of up to \u20b940,000 crore in the next five years across its business segments, including transmission and marketing of gas, and petrochemicals and pipelines.  This will entail borrowings of up to \u20b920,000 crore, while the rest will come from internal accruals,  the director of finance said. ",

        "articleBody": "Gautam Adani, Asia\u2019s richest man who built his empire on coal-led businesses, said the world\u2019s headlong rush into \u201cnascent\u201d green energy solutions has undergone a correction after the ongoing war in Ukraine forced countries to scramble for fossil fuel supplies.\u201cVery few are willing to admit that there had been an overswing on the side of green solutions and technologies that were still in their nascent stage,\u201d Adani wrote in a May 26 LinkedIn note after attending the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cThis fragility has been totally exposed by the crisis in Ukraine.\u201dBetter sense may now prevail around \u201cwhat pragmatic energy transitions might look like as opposed to green transitions based on little more than magical thinking,\u201d he said.The billionaire, who has pledged to invest $70 billion in the entire green energy supply chain by 2030, also called out the developed nations for \u201csetting targets and giving stern lectures about climate change to the rest of the world\u201d and sliding back to relying on dirtier fossil fuels when their energy security was threatened. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted the global supply chain, pushing crude oil and coal prices to multi-year highs.Adani, a first-generation entrepreneur whose net worth has risen the most this year to $99 billion, will also wrestle with the challenges around green energy as he seeks to pivot his ports-to-power conglomerate away from its fossil fuel-based origins. The tycoon has said he wants to build the greenest data centers -- a massive energy guzzling business -- and aims to be the world\u2019s biggest renewable power producer by the end of this decade, making him one of the key players if India has to meet its target of being carbon net-zero by 2070.Besides energy security, Adani said the conversation at Davos this year was heavily skewed toward border security and self-reliance in defense capabilities, underscoring how much \u201cthe world has been shaken\u201d by the war in Ukraine.\u201cAlmost every leader I spoke to acknowledged, and some even explicitly stated, that a new and more sophisticated arms race may now be coming on,\u201d he said, adding that alliances will now form around defense agreements. \u201cMany countries may prioritize defense manufacture and procurement as a non-negotiable aspect of self-reliance.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Official think tank Niti Aayog has kick-started the work on setting up an India-Norway task force for collaboration on clean energy, following an announcement made after a bilateral meeting between prime ministers of the two countries early this month.Suman Bery, vice chairman of Niti Aayog, recently held a meeting with Hans Jacob Frydenlund, Norwegian ambassador to India, on drawing up the broad contours of the task force, and a formal announcement will be made soon, a senior government official said.The task force will facilitate collaboration between the two countries on hydrogen, renewables, low carbon solutions and energy storage, the person told ET. \u201cThe purpose of the task force is to identify key projects for collaboration and mobilise relevant stakeholders at the highest level to ensure continued commitment and progress across ministries and agencies.\u201dIndia is upbeat about green hydrogen, green ammonia and renewable energy as it aims to export them while also reducing domestic carbon footprint to move towards the net zero target by 2070.The collaboration with Norway will include transfer and sharing of technology, knowhow and experience through the green hydrogen value chain and other relevant technologies including hydrogen storage and fuel cells.India is eyeing exports of green ammonia to developed economies like Japan, the US, South Korea and Europe where demand is projected to be more than 300 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) by 2030.Eyeing large-scale investments into the country in this sector, the government is firming up incentives to attract global players to produce green hydrogen and green ammonia in the country while seeking expertise in storage and transport of the clean fuel.India's non-fossil energy capacity is expected to reach 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and the aim is to ensure that the country meets half of its energy requirements through renewable energy by then, reducing the carbon intensity of its economy by less than 45%.India also aims to reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now on till 2030 and achieve the target of net zero by 2070.",

        "articleBody": "Japan on Friday for the first time joined fellow members of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in pledging to end public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of the year to help combat global warming. We commit to end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022,  G7 energy and climate ministers said in a joint statement following talks in Berlin.The term  unabated  refers to projects that do not employ techniques to offset some of the pollution caused by carbon dioxide emissions.Ending subsidies for the international fossil fuel energy sector was already part of a series of commitments agreed to by around 20 countries at last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.Six of the G7 club of rich nations were among the signatories at the time -- Britain, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the United States -- but Japan had resisted until now. It is good that Japan, the world's largest financier of fossil fuels, has now joined the other G7 countries in making a shared commitment to end overseas fossil fuel financing,  said Alden Meyer, senior associate at climate policy think tank E3G.Friday's pledge still allows for some  limited  exceptions of fossil-fuel financing so long as they are consistent with the 2015 Paris pact to curb global temperature increases. But Meyer said countries wishing to do so would face  a very stiff bar to clear .At their G7 talks, ministers also committed to largely end the use of fossil fuels in their electricity sectors by 2035, despite heavy tensions in the power market over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We further commit to a goal of achieving predominantly decarbonised electricity sectors by 2035,  they said.To achieve this, member states promised to ramp up  the necessary technologies and policies for the clean energy transition  and accelerate the phase-out of coal.The pledge was welcomed by environmental campaigners, at a time when the war in Ukraine has sent energy prices soaring and Western countries are scrambling to wean themselves off Russian imports. In a very difficult geopolitical situation, the G7 are united behind an end to fossil fuels by 2035 in the power sector. This is significant progress,  said David Ryfisch of the Germanwatch environmental group.Speaking at the closing press conference, German Energy Minister Robert Habeck welcomed the pledges made by G7 nations, saying they sent a  strong signal for more climate protection .As well as a pledge to stop bankrolling fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of the year, Habeck highlighted the club's agreement to ditch all  inefficient fossil fuel subsidies  by 2025. That we reward climate-damaging behaviour, either through direct subsidies or through tax advantages... is absurd and this absurdity has to stopped,  he told reporters.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in order to maintain the goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, all financing of new fossil fuel projects must be stopped immediately.The Oil Change International campaign group has calculated that between 2018 and 2020, G20 countries alone provided $188 billion in financing for overseas oil, coal and gas projects.",

        "articleBody": "As a part of the Economic Times Luminary Leadership Series, a platform created by ETILC in association with HSBC, to discuss the most pertinent matters in business, the Hyderabad edition focussed on climate change. Jayant Sinha, Member of Parliament and Former Minister of State for Finance, Sandeep Sharma, SVP & MD, RealPage India, Abhinav Bansal, Managing Director, and Partner, BCG India and Nikhil Singhal, Director & Head- Private Banking, HSBC India met top business leaders in Hyderabad to discuss how the government and the private sector can work together to grow the economy sustainably. Global Seriousness on Climate ChangeAccording to the Global Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch, Japan, Philippines, Germany, Madagascar, and India are the top five countries at risk of climate change. As per the World Bank, natural disasters cost about $18 billion a year in low- and middle-income countries, and climate change will push 132 million people into poverty over the next 10 years. The consequences will be dire and the investments required to make the required changes across energy, mobility, infrastructure, agriculture, and land use will be significant. McKinsey estimates that to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 universally $9.2 trillion is required in annual average spending on physical assets. This is more than half of the global profits in 2020. In the west, Climate Change is among the top three challenges that countries want to tackle. In India however, climate change is not a top priority and people are unable to make the connection between floods, droughts, and climate change. \u201cI began my career in energy modelling and am trained in operations research, so I can understand the complex dynamics of how the atmosphere is changing and how this is related to what we\u2019re seeing in Bundelkhand and Vidharbha. Not everyone can relate to these changes. The planetary dynamics, complex weather patterns, and climate feedback loops are changing. We are facing a planetary and existentialist emergency we have never faced before.\u201d says Jayant Sinha, Member of Parliament and Former Minister of State for Finance. India\u2019s Development ModelIndia\u2019s development model has conformed to the Farm-to-Factory model. According to the model, people move away from villages and towns toward cities. Industrialization and urbanization have driven development. Unfortunately, with increased productivity and development humankind has encroached upon nature to a catastrophic degree that resulted in air pollution, floods, and water shortages. In the past 200 years, we have increased the Earth\u2019s temperature by 1.2-1.3 degrees celsius. However, in the next 80 years, the Earth will become warmer by 1.52 degrees. According to a study by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, India is among the top three countries that emit greenhouse gases. We are responsible for 2.46 billion metric tonnes of carbon or 6.8% of the total global emissions. If India continues on this old model of development, as the world moves from emissions of 36 billion metric tonnes to zero, we will go from 2.46 billion metric tons of carbon to 7 billion metric tonnes of carbon emissions by 2050. Therefore, India now has to do what no other country in the world has achieved - which is to grow GDP but sustainably. \u201cHowever, for this change to be implemented, climate change has to be a defining political issue for citizens and policymakers. Unfortunately, unlike European countries, that is not yet the case in India,\u201d says Jayant Sinha, Member of Parliament and Former Minister of State for Finance. Key Focus Areas For Green InitiativesIn the budget this year, the Finance Minister made many announcements about the growth of green energy, electric mobility, grid-connected energy storage, and incentives for green bonds. She also made several solar sector-related announcements, including a Rs 19,500-crore additional allocation under the PLI scheme, for manufacturing high-efficiency solar modules. In four months we\u2019re also likely to have a battery-swapping policy in place to boost the use of EVs. Now, what the private sector wants are more government incentives, skilling for battery recycling, and tax incentives for clean energy. \u201cThe narrative around this space needs to change. We need something like Aatmanirbhar Bharat, maybe a \u201cNet-Zero Bharat\u201d, that we can all get behind and that will give clear direction on the objectives and initiatives,\u201d says Sandeep Sharma, SVP & MD, RealPage India \u201cIf you are ESG compliant and if you are investing in green technologies, that gives you a premium on your share price. And when you look at individual projects, these green projects yield better returns because the cost of funds is lower and returns are more premium. As far as investments in green projects are concerned, they are no longer constrained by economic profitability or profitability. The drive to do this work cannot be driven by tax incentives, it must be driven by the sheer opportunity in this space,\u201d says Abhinav Bansal, MD & Partner, BCG India. \u201cHSBC is committed to innovation and is at the forefront of these initiatives. We have sustainable finance initiatives, which involve companies that are going to support the net-zero objectives of the government. We have a whole suite of climate change funds which are global funds for which we have created an India feeder unit. The objective is to give exposure to our Indian clientele to this commercial opportunity and also influence their mindset. We\u2019re also doing a lot of work in the area of green bonds and are positioned to be market leaders in that space,\u201d says Nikhil Singhal, Director & Head- Private Banking, HSBC India \u201cA clear policy framework and more incentives will help the private sector get on board and accelerate the pace of change in this area,\u201d says Vinod Lalwani, Founder & Director, Prayagh Nutri Products In conclusion, while one part of the private sector understands that future opportunities in green technology and switching to sustainable methods of working are economically viable and a large opportunity, there is a segment that will need more government-driven initiatives and incentives to make a change.",

        "articleBody": "India could have averted the April power crisis if progress towards the 175 GW renewable energy goal was on track, according to new analysis by think tank Climate Risk Horizons. In April 2022, India witnessed acute power shortage due to unavailability of coal supplies, with more than 100 million units (MU) of energy shortage on 8 days over the course of the month. This forced discoms in several states to enforce load-shedding and rolling blackouts to ration power. The power shortage was due to problems with the evacuation and stockpiling of coal at thermal power plants, combined with a spike in the price of imported coal.March 2022 was also the hottest in 122 years, causing increased power demand for cooling, with impacts on coal stocks at power plants. There was little relief from high temperatures in April.  91688209In 2016, India set an ambitious goal of reaching 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, and as of April 2022, it had 95 GW of operating solar and wind power. This implies a target slippage of about 51 GW. \u201cOur analysis shows that if we had been on track to achieve our RE target, there would have been no power crisis. The additional generation from solar and wind would have erased the energy shortage and would have allowed power plants to conserve their dwindling coal stocks for evening peak periods when solar generation dips,\u201d said Abhishek Raj, analyst with Climate Risk Horizons.He said the additional RE generation would have translated into a saving of at least 4.4 million tonnes of coal. The power shortage has led to some calls to further augment India's coal power and mining capacity, despite the fact that there was no shortage of coal stocks at mines, nor was there a shortage of installed coal power generation capacity. Rather, the crisis was a result of lack of coal supply, due to logistical and cash flow reasons. \u201cTwo things are true: without the massive RE growth since 2016, the power crisis in April would have been much, much worse. At the same time, if we had been on track for 175 GW by the end of the year, there would have been no power crisis at all,  said Ashish Fernandes, CEO of Climate Risk Horizons.  Logistical constraints in the coal supply chain are a permanent feature and will certainly recur, as will heat waves; the best safeguard is to diversify our electricity mix. This reinforces the need for the center and state governments to rapidly scale up their RE deployment and reduce dependence on coal,\u201d he said.",

This amendment proposal will pave the way for the Make in India drive thereby leading to a reduction in import of petroleum products by the generation of more and more biofuels. Since many more feedstocks are being allowed for the production of biofuels, this will promote the Atmanirbhar Bharat and give an impetus to Prime Minister's vision of India becoming 'energy independent' by 2047,  the statement added.",

        "articleBody": "The commerce ministry's investigation arm DGTR has recommended for continuation of anti-dumping duty on Chinese solar glass for two years with a view to guard domestic players from cheap imports. In a notification, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has said that continued imposition of anti-dumping duty is required on 'textured tempered coated and un-coated glass' from China.  The product in the market parlance is also known by various names such as solar glass, solar glass low iron and solar photovoltaic glass. It is used as a component in solar photovoltaic panels and solar thermal applications.   The designated authority considers it appropriate to recommend continuation of anti-dumping duty on the imports of subject goods from the subject country for further period of 2 years...,  the DGTR has said.  The directorate has recommended duties in the range of USD 192.82 per tonne and USD 302.65 per tonne.  The finance ministry takes the final decision to impose this duty.  In its probe, the DGTR has concluded that the product is being exported to India at prices below normal value and that is resulting in continued dumping.   The domestic industry has been constantly suffering losses due to price effect of dumped imports from China and also imports coming from related company of one of the Chinese producers in Malaysia,  it has said.  In the event of expiry of the duty, the DGTR stated that there is a clear likelihood of dumping of the goods in  significant volumes  and consequent injury to the domestic industry.  China is one of the largest producers of this glass. There are significant unutilised capacities there, fraction of which is sufficient to cater to entire Indian demand.  Borosil Renewables Ltd had filed an application for sunset review of anti-dumping investigation concerning the imports of this glass from China.  The revenue department had imposed the duty in August 2017.  In international trade parlance, dumping happens when a country or a firm exports an item at a price lower than the price of that product in its domestic market.  Dumping impacts price of that product in the importing country, hitting margins and profits of manufacturing firms.  According to global trade norms, a country is allowed to impose tariffs on such dumped products to provide a level-playing field to domestic manufacturers. The duty is imposed only after a thorough investigation by a quasi-judicial body, such as DGTR, in India.  In its probe, the directorate has to conclude whether the imported products are impacting domestic industries.",

Addressing investors at a conference in Munich, Germany, Khuba said India offers a great opportunity for investments.   Currently around USD 196.98 billion worth of projects are underway in India. I once again invite all the developed countries and major RE (renewable energy) players to utilise the opportunity India is offering to the world,  he said.  Khuba delivered the keynote address at 'Intersolar Europe 2022' on  India's Solar Energy Market .  He said under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious Panchamrit targets set during COP26, India is all set to achieve net zero by 2070 and install 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.  The minister further said India's vast renewable energy resource potential and strong policy backing provide a strong foundation for achieving these goals.  He pointed out that India has seen incredible growth of RE capacity in the last seven years and has achieved the target of 40 per cent cumulative electric capacity from non-fossil fuels in 2021, a full nine years ahead of the target of 2030.  Government of India is committed to promoting domestic manufacturing in the solar photovoltaic (PV) sector to achieve its ambitious deployment goals. Several policy measures have been undertaken to support the domestic PV manufacturing sector.  The minister also emphasised that India is committed to increasing domestic manufacturing of high-efficiency solar PV modules for which total budget outlay of Rs 24,000 crore has been made.  Further, to promote green hydrogen economy, India has estimated an outlay of Rs 25,425 crore.  The Green Hydrogen Mission eyes generating 4.1 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s growth over the next few years is likely to be driven by the government\u2019s big infrastructure push. The construction sector represents almost a 10th of the country\u2019s economy. India is the second-largest producer of cement in the world.It would seem an odd time, therefore, for a major cement company to abandon the giant country. Yet that\u2019s apparently what Holcim AG of Switzerland, the world\u2019s biggest producer of cement, is planning to do.Nor would this be the only such exit to occur recently. Last September, Holcim sold its Brazil operations for $1 billion. Dublin-based CRH Plc sold its own Brazil operations in 2020 and, before the pandemic hit, was apparently looking for buyers for its subsidiary in the Philippines.You could, if you wanted, see this trend as a sign of maturity for emerging-market players. Adani Enterprises Ltd. is said to have pulled together $13.5 billion for its bid to take over Holcim\u2019s stake in Ambuja Cements Ltd. and ACC Ltd. Holcim\u2019s Brazilian assets were bought by local steelmaker CSN Resources SA. Once the deal receives final approval from regulators, CSN will be Brazil\u2019s second-largest cement producer.Adani and CSN or their equivalents \u2014 and not developed-world multinationals \u2014 will thus reap the rewards of growth in their home markets. Meanwhile, those Western companies can retire some debt and focus on their own home markets, which are also buzzing with activity in the wake of giant pandemic stimulus packages.But that isn\u2019t the whole story. A large part of the reason why exits from emerging markets look attractive is that they help Western companies in hard-to-abate sectors such as steel and cement hit increasingly aggressive sustainability targets \u2014 and, conveniently, tap new pools of capital. In September 2020, Holcim committed itself to a more than 20% reduction in CO2 intensity by 2030 and, beyond that, to a \u201c1.5-degree future.\u201d A month later, the company announced a sustainability-linked bond issue worth 850 million euros.In the developed world, corporate net-zero pledges such as the one Holcim adopted are increasingly in favor with both activist investors and ambitious managers. And they have become crucial ways for institutional investors and others to enforce climate-related discipline on companies, even in sectors that were long resistant to change. Green bonds are the carrot; shareholder rebellions, of the sort that CRH is facing, are the stick.Yet will this strategy really reduce global emissions? Or will it simply drive Western companies to abandon the emerging-market giants such as India and Brazil that are the real battlefields against emissions growth?Over time, such decisions may diminish the prospects of a net-zero future rather than increase them. Decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors such as cement will require money and technology. While local companies may not be any less committed to a net-zero future than their Western counterparts, the fact is that they will have a harder time accessing both.For one, emerging-market governments don\u2019t have the resources to help out by properly subsidizing research and development. As a consequence, Indian steelmakers, for example, have consistently spent far less on R&D as a proportion of their revenue than their OECD counterparts.By contrast, Europe\u2019s mammoth green deal includes boatloads of cash to promote low-carbon innovation at home. Just last month, the European Commission handed out 1.1 billion euros ($1.16 billion) to seven such projects \u2014 two of which targeted emissions reductions in steel and cement. (The beneficiary in the cement sector was a French subsidiary of CRH, Eqiom SAS.)Suppose some of these moon shots wind up working. If we really intend a \u201c1.5-degree future,\u201d as all these pledges promise, then innovations will need to be deployed swiftly, at scale \u2014 and globally, not just in Europe and North America. How is that going to happen if the companies most likely to develop and own these innovations have abandoned the markets where they are most needed?Activist investors on the lookout for \u201cgreenwashing\u201d have to be careful of the unintended consequences of their choices. Companies need to be rewarded for reducing emissions globally, not for scaling down their ambitions to focus on geographies where greener manufacturing is easiest. And pools of finance that claim to be dedicated to investing in low-carbon projects need to start scoping out companies that are operating in places such as Brazil and India. Unless factories in the emerging world have access to the cash and the know-how they need, low-carbon development will remain out of reach \u2014 as will a 1.5-degree world.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s power, coal and railway ministries face a  major challenge  in ensuring adequate electricity supplies with demand unlikely to decline, power and renewable energy minister RK Singh told ET\u2019s Sarita C Singh & Vinay Pandey in an exclusive interview. Singh said the directive mandating imported coal-based plants to keep producing power might be extended beyond October and the ministry has facilitated finance to about 4 GW of stressed imported coal-based plants that are expected to be ready to operate in three-four days. Edited excerpts:-The ministry has invoked Section 11 of the Electricity Act on imported coal-based power projects. How do you ensure it gets implemented?We just passed the order. We are going to monitor on a daily basis. I review the overall situation every day and the reports are put up to me about which of the imported coal-based power plants have started. If they have not started functioning, why not. So we pursue this on a daily basis.What is the course of action for projects that are stressed or are in NCLT?We had called the bankers as well as resolution professionals of plants which were commissioned and then got stressed. The plants will function as we have tied up all the requirements and financing mechanisms detailing how much money will come from where and how that will be structured. We have also decided to make arrangements for providing finance for running some of these plants from Power Finance Corp (PFC) and REC and we have worked out escrow arrangements so that working capital does not become a problem. We have a total of 17,600-mw of imported coal-based plants, of which 11000-Mw are running. About 5,000-6,000 Mw are not running. However, almost 4,000-Mw will be ready to run in the 3-4 days as they will tie up everything.We have asked the project developers to place orders on coal on the high seas so that they get the coal as fast as possible.What will be the impact on power tariffs?Tariffs of imported coal-based plants will be higher than domestic coal plants. But it will go up very marginally. If you look at the whole coal basket, there are two things, one is blending. We have asked all the thermal plants to blend 10% imported coal. Blending will increase power cost by only a margin. For example, if the total cost of power is Rs 4.50 per unit, after blending 10% coal price goes up by Rs 0.5 a unit. It is much better to buy power at Rs 5 per unit, than load shedding or to buy power in exchanges at Rs 12 per unit. Right now the maximum exchange price is Rs 12 per unit. It was Rs 20 per unit, which we asked CERC to lower. Even for imported coal-based plants the cost will come to about Rs 5.50-6 per unit.Most states have taken steps to procure imported coal by calling for bids. Some states have still not started. We keep pushing them and warning them they will run out of coal.Is invoking Section 11 an ad hoc arrangement or are the imported coal based plants going to be used to meet peak requirements only?It is an ad hoc arrangement till October. My assessment is perhaps this will have to continue because I don\u2019t see demand coming down. So, I believe the requirement of imported coal for plants will continue for the next two years because expanding coal production takes three years. I expect demand to stay 200 Gw plus for the coming years. That\u2019s good news because it shows our economy has grown. It\u2019s a major challenge for us, the coal and railway ministry, to ensure power supplies continue at that level.What are the provisions if the imported coal power plants do not operate?The law says if any direction is violated there is section 142. There can be penalties and fines.So profit or loss, these plants have to run?There is provision in the Act which says that if there is any loss, the generators can go before the appropriate commission. It will calculate whether there is loss and pass directions for recouping that. They have a recourse to the commission. But my assessment is there is no question of them going into any losses. Why can\u2019t the idling gas-based capacity be operationalised too?I keep enquiring the gas prices because we have 24 Gw of gas-based capacity. Generation from gas will cost Rs 20 per unit. I think it is high and not an option as yet.Why is there a lot of capacity under outage everyday?Nearly 15% of our thermal and nuclear plants would be in periodic maintenance at any given point. There are some plants where defects like water leakage keep happening. But the issue today is not shortage of capacity, it is shortage of coal.There was a shortage of coal import at 24 MT in 2021-22 as compared to 42 MT 2020-21 due to high prices. Shortage In imported coal made all the difference. How do you expect the ministry of coal to substitute this in such a short span of time?Does the coal and gas-led crisis increase emphasis on renewable energy?We have added a lot of renewables but we need to add more. Starting a coal mine is a major issue. It takes a year to get environmental clearances alone. Then it takes almost a year to acquire the land and almost a year to resettle the people.Karnataka right now is selling on power exchange because it has renewable. Renewable energy makes a lot of difference. We are not in a grave crisis because of renewables.I have asked my office to invite fresh bids seeking 1,500-Mw renewable with storage and 2,200-Mw renewable plus thermal supply so that there is less load on coal. There is one more bid on 1,500-Mw with hydro for which we are checking the untied hydro capacity. We need to do this.These bids will be called as soon as possible because the demand for power has gone up and we believe we have to move towards renewables plus storage as soon as possible. Both for reasons of energy transition and also there is actually a finite limit of the expansion of coal mining capacity in a short-time frame.While we can bring renewable power on stream within 18-24 months, it is clean and in line with our commitments made in COP26. All the future bids will be with storage because that is dispatchable power. There should be no difference between thermal power and renewables in so far as the dispatchability is concerned.Do you expect issues with states if storage increases costs?One state had tried to tamper with the power purchase agreements but the high court in that state had come down heavily on that. No other states will try it. States must understand investments will only come if the sanctity of contracts is maintained.In this backdrop of reliance on renewables, are you saying no more coal capacity will be added?No, I am not saying that because we are a big country and our demand has only started growing now. The industrialised countries have been using fossil fuel for their growth for the past many decades. Our first requirement is to make sure there is enough power available for growth. There is not going to be any compromise on that.As far as our concerns on the environment are concerned, it is second to none. Our per capita emissions are one-third of the world average. We don\u2019t have to take any action as far as reduction of emissions is concerned. Notwithstanding that, we are the only country whose energy transition actions are consonant with sub-two degree rise in temperature. We are doing much more than our share and we will continue to do so. But if you are asking me to compromise with the availability of power for my growth, sorry. We are going to add 500 Gw of non-fossil power but for base load, conventional capacity will be there. ",

        "articleBody": "As the world faces the most severe energy crisis since 1970s, a new study by the World Economic Forum on Wednesday called for urgent action by both private and public sectors to ensure a resilient energy transition to address the challenges to environmental sustainability, energy security and energy justice and affordability.The pace of energy transition needs to be supercharged, as demonstrated by recent spike in fuels prices, challenges to energy security and the slow progress on climate action, the WEF (World Economic Forum) said.According to the report, 'Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2022', the urgency for countries to accelerate a holistic energy transition is reinforced by high fuel prices, commodities' shortages, insufficient headway on achieving the climate goals and slow progress on energy justice and access.Building on 10 years of the Energy Transition Index, an annual country benchmarking report, the new special edition report, launched in collaboration with Accenture, also listed key recommendations for governments, companies, consumers and other stakeholders on how to progress the energy transition. Prioritising a resilient energy transition and diversification of the energy mix is crucial in responding to energy market volatility,  the WEF said.To accelerate the transition to cleaner energy supply and demand, the report notes that more countries need to make binding climate commitments, create long-term visions for domestic and regional energy systems, attract private sector investors for decarbonisation projects and help consumers and the workforce adjust, according to the report. Countries are at risk of future events compounding the disruption of their energy supply chain at a time when the window to prevent the worst consequences of climate change is closing fast,  said Roberto Bocca, Head of Energy, Materials and Infrastructure, World Economic Forum. While there are difficult decisions to be taken to align the imperatives of energy security, sustainability and affordability in the short term, now is the time to double down on action,  Bocca said.The report also flagged structural barriers to balancing energy affordability, security and availability with sustainability, saying it was due to compounded shocks to the energy system from a post-pandemic surge in energy demand, fuel supply bottlenecks, inflationary pressures and reconfigured energy supply chains as a result of the war in Ukraine.To navigate this challenging situation, countries must pursue diversification on two fronts -\u2013 not only in the domestic energy mix in the long term but also in considering their fuels and energy suppliers in the shorter term, the WEF said.Most countries rely on just a handful of trade partners to meet their energy requirements and have a deficient diversification of energy sources, providing limited flexibility to deal with disruptions.The report noted that of 34 countries with advanced economies, 11 rely on only three trade partners for over 70 per cent of their fuel imports.",

        "articleBody": "The European Union executive wants to speed up the bloc's green transition and cut its reliance on Russian fuels by allowing some renewable energy projects to receive permits within a year, a draft document shows. Brussels will next week unveil a package of measures to end the European Union's reliance on Russia, by boosting renewable energy, saving energy and increasing gas imports from elsewhere. As part of this, the European Commission will propose rules requiring countries to designate  go-to areas  of land or sea suitable for renewable energy, where such projects would have a low environmental impact, the draft legislative proposal shows.  The permit-granting process for new projects located in renewables go-to areas shall not exceed one year,  the document said, adding that this could be extended by three months in  extraordinary circumstances . That compares with the EU's current two-year deadline for permitting such schemes, which can also be extended by an extra year. Projects outside of go-to areas would stick to this timeline, the draft said. Renewable projects often face far longer delays, however, owing to red tape, local opposition or concerns about protecting endangered species, raising concerns that the bloc will struggle to expand wind and solar energy fast enough to meet climate change goals. In Greece, for example, eight years is a typical timeline for approving wind energy projects, the Hellenic Wind Energy Association said.  Renewable energy sources are crucial to fight climate change, reduce energy prices, decrease the Union's dependence on fossil fuels and ensure the Union's security of supply,  the document said. Permitting and building renewable energy projects would be labelled as in the  overriding public interest , enabling a simplified assessment. EU citizens would still have the right to participate in decisions on the projects, the draft said. Go-to areas would avoid protected sites or bird migration routes, and prioritise built areas like rooftops, roads and railways, industrial sites and public land around them. The overall areas would be subject to an environmental assessment, but individual projects would no longer need one, unless they would significantly affect the environment in another EU country, the draft said. Smaller projects with less than 150kW capacity in go-to areas would face a faster six-month permitting process, or nine if there are issues around safety or the impact on the power grid. The speedier permit rules would not apply to plants that burn biomass for energy. ",

        "articleBody": "The government is considering a proposal to mandate all power projects, including captive, to set up renewable projects at their existing locations under their current contracts with distribution companies and sell bundled electricity, power and renewable energy minister R K Singh said. \u201cWe shall have to start bundling every capacity under the same power purchase agreement, which will reduce the requirement of coal by 25-30% and give low cost power. Similarly large corporates with coal-based captive power plants will be mandated to set up captive renewable projects, which they can blend and use, Singh said. The proposal is likely to be applicable on 210 Gw of independent coal-based power plants in the country. The renewable generation obligations are similar to renewable purchase obligations under which obligated entities have to source a percentage of electricity consumption from green sources. \u201cThe renewable energy generation mandate will depend on flexibilitsation of coal-based power plants which today in Indian context is 55%. For example, as we assume the plants operate at 85% plant load factor, there is 30% available space for renewable energy addition,\u201d a senior ministry official said. \u201cThis will help the country in faster energy transition,\u201d Singh said. In COP 26 at Glasgow last November, India proposed to cut its emissions to zero by 2070. The country announced 500 Gw of non-fossil electricity capacity, 50% renewable energy capacity, reduction of emissions by 1 billion tonnes and reduction of emissions intensity of the GDP by 45% by 2030. Singh said a hydro capacity of 32 Gw at an investment of Rs 3 lakh crore has been identified to be set up. Construction on these projects would start in 3-4 years. He said a capacity of 71 Gw of hydro capacity is estimated to be required in order to meet the targeted 500 Gw of non-fossil energy by 2030. India has 46500 Mw of hydro capacity, 12500-Mw is under construction.",

        "articleBody": "By Saipriya Salla, Ananya Saini, Pamela JouvenAnand runs a small enterprise that focuses on last-mile logistics in rural parts of the Indian states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. He\u2019s been working to build this service for the past 7 years, and now has a team of 50 employees and a fleet of approximately 100 vehicles to support companies with delivery logistics. He recently attended a webinar focused on \u2018net-zero\u2019, or achieving a balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. The webinar emphasized that the Indian government aims to achieve \u2018net-zero\u2019 nationwide by 2070, and many businesses, governments and individuals are targeting 2050 or sooner.These timelines felt so far in the future that Anand was unsure what this meant for his small organization. He and his team explored purchasing more electric vehicles to build a business that\u2019s better for the planet, and to take advantage of government tax breaks. The infrastructure to deploy these vehicles was still minimal in their regions of operation, and he needed additional resources to fully make the transition. Nonetheless, it became increasingly evident that investors, governments and the business community alike are calling on small and growing businesses (SGBs) to become more sustainable \u2013 with a few going even further by providing the vital support SGBs need to meet these expectations.In India alone, there are over 60 million microbusinesses and small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) \u2014 and they employ over 110 million people . They play a vital role in the local economy, and they are responsible for the functioning and creation of products and services used within the value chains of large multinational corporations around the world. Value chains primarily consist of SGBs and can account for up to 90% of a business\u2019 total emissions. We cannot keep global temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C and avoid the worst effects of climate change without bringing small businesses on the journey to net zero, and providing the necessary support for the transition.Like Anand, SGBs across the globe often do not have the knowledge or resources to navigate the nuances of a net-zero transition, and to measure and manage their emissions effectively. In a recent survey from the SME Climate Hub, 63% of small business respondents said they did not feel they have the right skills to take the most robust climate action.SMEs are still recovering from the debilitating effects of the pandemic, and with limited funding available for sustainable shifts, they often find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place. Though taking action will benefit their business financially and provide long term stability through future systemic shocks, it\u2019s getting to net zero that\u2019s the uphill battle.Intermediaries have a responsibility - and an opportunity - to create a supportive environment to transition towards a more sustainable future. With the right support, the SGB sector can play a huge role in cutting global emissions and helping to achieve national climate and energy goals. Intermediaries - from finance, government and NGOs - must come together to facilitate action:1) Equip SGBs with tools to navigate the net-zero transition: Take the SME Climate Hub, for example. The initiative brings together organizations across government, finance, nonprofit, education and corporate sectors to simplify climate action for SMEs through free tools and resources. The initiative recently launched the Business Carbon Calculator to help SMEs measure their carbon footprint and identify emissions hotspots. The resulting footprint helps SMEs establish a baseline from which they can best take action to reduce emissions through the suite of SME Climate Hub tools available. Easy-to-use resources must be the rule, not the exception. 2) Advocate for - and implement - a conducive policy environment: SGBs need incentives to prioritize climate action \u2014 and governments must help by offering benefits, such as tax breaks and greater visibility on government marketplaces. The Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) and Eco-Certifications are laudable examples of urging small and growing businesses to think about sustainability actively. The SGLS endorses industrial and consumer products that are produced in an environmentally-friendly manner, and the country has around 10 different kinds of eco-certifications that can be availed by small businesses after undergoing the relevant audit and meeting environmental standards defined.3) Make sustainability a requirement when considering investments, and before providing funding: According to a study by the Harvard Business Review, environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) is a top priority for investment decisions. Aavishkar Group, for example, incubates social entrepreneurs in Asia and Africa to create beneficiaries across SDGs. According to the group\u2019s impact report, their investments have resulted in the reduction of 1.5 million MT of CO2 emissions, the creation of 85,000 jobs, and the provision of essential services to 28 million people. Sustainability as a requirement before funding can lead to scaling of climate-positive impacts.4) Build platforms and networks for small and growing businesses to support each other: Network organisations provide support, feedback, insights, and resources to SGBs that may lack the financial means to take action alone. They also enable peer-to-peer learning, which helps scale business and foster innovation. For example, in India, the Clean Energy Access Network (CLEAN) unifies and strengthens clean energy enterprises by providing access to finance, knowledge and other resources. Moreover, network organisations can help SGBs come together to voice the financial and policy support they require to enable an effective transition.We have a long way to go toward strengthening the ecosystem that supports these transitions, and if the climate indicators tell us anything, we need to move exceptionally fast. It\u2019s imperative there is a multi-pronged approach to help SGBs reach net zero. Intermediaries, from nonprofits to governments and investors, must come together to catalyse the SGB community and ensure no one is left behind in the transition.(Saipriya Salla and Ananya Saini are Program Associates at the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs.

        "articleBody": "The Centre on Friday said it has opened a six-month window till October for sugar mills to submit fresh proposals to avail loans at a subsidised interest rate for setting up new distilleries or expanding the existing facilities for augmenting first-generation ethanol capacity in the country. To ensure that only serious project proponents are issued in-principle approval by the Union Food Ministry, a window has been opened for fresh applications from those project proponents who have acquired land for projects and obtained environmental clearance, it said.   The six months window has been opened from April 21 to October 22,  an official spokesperson told PTI.  According to the Food Ministry, the decision will facilitate sugar mills to set up new distilleries or expand their existing distilleries and thereby help in diverting excess sugarcane/sugar to ethanol.   New grain-based distilleries would come up in deficit states like north-eastern states, southern states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and states like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh etc. This would help in the distributed production of ethanol,  the ministry said in a statement.  The government is implementing a scheme since 2018 to offer soft loans to sugar mills and distilleries with an aim to increase ethanol output and its supply under Ethanol Blended with Petrol (EBP) Programme, especially during the surplus season and thereby improving the liquidity position of the sugar mills enabling them to clear cane price arrears of the farmers.  Under this scheme, the government is extending financial assistance in the form of interest subvention at 6 per cent annum or 50 per cent of the rate of interest charged by banks, whichever is lower, on the loans to be extended by banks for five years including one-year moratorium.  Ethanol capacity is being enhanced in order to reduce the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels, save foreign exchange on account of crude oil import bills and reduce air pollution.  The government has fixed a target of 10 per cent blending of fuel-grade ethanol with petrol by 2022 and 20 per cent by 2025.   ...ethanol production capacities are required to be enhanced to about 1700 crore litre to achieve 20 per cent blending by 2025. Opening of window would help in augmentation of ethanol production capacities,  the ministry said.  At present, the country has a total ethanol production capacity of 849 crore litre, which includes 569 crore litres of molasses-based distilleries and 280 crore litres of grain-based distilleries, it added.  There has been an eight-time increase in the production of fuel-grade ethanol and its supply to oil marketing companies (OMCs) from 2013-14 to 2020-21.  In 2020-21, it had touched a high of 302.30 crore litre, thereby achieving 8.10 per cent blending. In the current 2021-22 year, 158 crore litres of ethanol have been blended with petrol till April 17, thereby achieving 9.77 per cent blending.  It is expected that a 10 per cent blending target will be achieved in 2021-22, it added.",

        "articleBody": "India's coal imports are starting to reflect shifting world trade and pricing dynamics in the wake of Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. India, the world's second-biggest coal importer behind China, has long been viewed as a price-sensitive buyer of the polluting fuel, and given the surge in prices after Russia's Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine, it was always likely that trade flows would be affected. Russia is the world's third-largest coal exporter and it's expected that many buyers, especially in Europe and Japan, will stop importing fuel from Russia in coming months as part of economic efforts to isolate Moscow. India hasn't been a major buyer of Russian coal, but it will still be affected by the loss of Russian cargoes as other importers seek to replace Russian volumes with supplies from exporters such as Australia, Indonesia and South Africa. These three exporters are India's major suppliers and are likely to see increasing demand for cargoes in coming months. South African cargoes are likely to flow to Europe as it seeks to replace Russian coal, while Australian volumes are likely to increase to traditional buyers in north Asia, such as Japan and South Korea. India's overall coal imports look set to be relatively robust in April, with commodity consultants Kpler estimating arrivals will total 15.92 million tonnes. This is down from March's 21.79 million tonnes, but up from 12.77 million in February. March was something of an outlier for coal imports across Asia, as volumes surged after Indonesia ended an abrupt one-month ban on exports, which had impacted its shipments in January and February. Looking at the breakdown of India's imports reveals flows are already shifting. It's important to separate the main types of coal, namely metallurgical, or coking, coal used to make steel, and thermal coal used to generate power or in some industrial processes such as making cement. India's imports of coking coal have been steady in recent months, reflecting strong demand for steel, both for domestic consumption and for export. April imports of coking coal are estimated by Kpler at 4.66 million tonnes, down from 6.17 million in March but in line with February's 5.01 million and January's 4.91 million. Australia, the world's top exporter of coking coal, remains the top supplier, with imports of 3.17 million tonnes likely in April, down from 3.96 million in March and 3.51 million in February. The slight drop in coking coal imports from Australia shows the resilience of this trade, given that the price of Australian coking coal on the Singapore Exchange has sky-rocketed in recent months, reaching a record high of $635 a tonne on March 10. It has since slipped back to $483.33 a tonne at the close on Wednesday, but this is still more than four times the $111 it was trading at on the same day last year. India has few options to secure alternative supplies of coking coal, with Russia perhaps being the best hope, although it's worth noting that April arrival of this grade of coal from Russia are estimated at just 238,933 tonnes, down from 620,748 in March and 383,016 in February. This means that India has little choice when it comes to coking coal but to buy what it can from Australia, with alternatives such as Canada and the United States likely to prove just as pricey, especially when the higher freight costs are included. THERMAL DYNAMICS For thermal coal, it appears India is trying to shift to cheaper supplies from Indonesia, with Kpler estimating April arrivals from the Southeast Asian nation at 7.37 million tonnes. While this is down from 9.79 million tonnes in March, it is up strongly from 3.54 million in February and 2.45 million in January. At the same time, India's imports of thermal coal from Australia are dropping, down to 908,795 tonnes in April, compared to 982,238 in March and well below the recent peak of 2.10 million in November last year. Imports from South Africa are also slipping, with April arrivals slated to reach 1.16 million tonnes, down from 2.86 million in March and 2.20 million in February. Both South African and Australian thermal coal prices have surged since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with futures for benchmark Australian Newcastle cargoes ending at $326.35 a tonne on Wednesday, versus the record high of $440 on March 2, but more than four times the $93.75 from the same day in 2021. Indonesian coal prices have also rallied, but nowhere near to the extent as those for Australian and South African, most likely reflecting more limited export markets for the lower-energy coal produced by the Southeast Asian nation. Indonesian coal contracts in Singapore ended at $90.38 a tonne on Wednesday, down from the recent record high of $140 on March 3, and also just slightly less than double the $47.82 from April 20 last year. It's likely that Indian utilities will continue to seek out cheaper Indonesian thermal coal, as well as looking at heavily discounted Russian coal in coming months, while seeking to cut out unaffordable cargoes from Australia and South Africa.

        "articleBody": "India is falling behind on delivering the targets of increasing its non-fossil energy capacity to 175 gigawatts by 2022 and 500 GW by 2030 as many states, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana are lagging on this front, climate and energy experts said on Wednesday. The comments were made during a webinar held by Climate Trends, a Delhi-based climate communications initiative, on how the northern power grid can accelerate the transition and help India meet its 2030 Glasgow commitments while contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The webinar was held close on the heels of the release of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC)'s Working Group III report on Mitigation recently.  We are falling behind on delivering the targets of 175GW by 2022 and 500 GW by 2030 because while some states are on track others are lagging,  said Aditya Lolla, Senior Electricity Policy Analyst for Asia at energy think tank Ember. He said in the southern region, Telangana has achieved its renewable energy target and in the north, only Rajasthan is ahead and has achieved its 2022 target.  But there are states like Uttar Pradesh which have not even achieved 30 per cent of their target. If I compare these two states, both have a 14 GW target for 2022. While Rajasthan has achieved 17GW currently, Uttar Pradesh is lagging at 4GW,  Lolla said. The story is similar in Uttarakhand (1 GW), Punjab (2GW) and Haryana (1GW). The pro-renewables states are making profits with this transition, like the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd made a profit of Rs 65 crores last year, due to their RE adoption, he said. According to the IPCC, to achieve 1.5 degrees C, the world must reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 48 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. This means that governments will need to rapidly introduce policies and measures for emissions to peak by 2025. In the last climate summit in Glasgow, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced enhanced climate targets for India, including increasing its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW and meeting 50 per cent of its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. To achieve this capacity, India needs to install 42GW of renewable energy every year. Experts feel that India will miss its 500GW of non-fossil fuel energy target because it is lagging in rooftop solar installations.  This is mainly because different states have responded differently to the target. We have achieved only 54 GW of the 100 GW target for solar.  Wind power has also slowed down in the last couple of years. This is mainly because the power purchase agreements in some states got cancelled by DISCOMS... This has happened in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Karnataka.  To provide stability and achieve renewable energy targets, we first need a consistent policy across all the states. After this, state governments need to solve their local problems,  Lolla explained. Parth Bhatia, Associate Fellow, Centre for Policy Research and Contributing Author on IPCC WGIII report, Chapter 13 - Policies and Institutions, said the latest IPCC report stated that almost all electricity should come from low or zero fossil fuel sources to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius target.  It means that all coal-based power plant assets become a stranded asset risk by 2030 as transitions will accelerate.  The goal is to avoid locking in high-carbon and wasteful energy systems for the long-term as the window to decarbonise is extremely short now. Coal becomes an economic liability and risk in this scenario,  he said. Experts feel that to provide stability and achieve renewable energy targets, India first needs a consistent policy across all the states. After this, state governments need to solve their local problems and there is a need to create an economy where the private sector sees an opportunity. They concurred that India will need to focus on a battery of solutions and policy changes on both the demand and supply sides. If the northern grid has to decarbonise, adjoining states such as Uttar Pradesh, which produces almost 10 per cent of the country's electricity share need to increase their renewable energy uptake, experts said.  In India, we have seen a stark difference emerging among states. The developed states are where the penetration and transition are happening. These are the states that are driving the renewable energy push.  Many north Indian states are yet to catch up. States like Uttar Pradesh have great potential but there is a need for state-level policy to give the push. Delhi has a big role to steer the transition in the northern grid as they have the highest demand and will depend largely on neighbours to get their energy.  said Manish Ram, Researcher, Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology, Finland.",

        "articleBody": "Indian private sector has to drive the carbon transition efforts as the country's significant economic development needs will constrain the government's ability to extend sufficient financial support, said Moody's Investors Service.According to Moody's, many large corporations have launched a wide range of emission targets through 2050. India's (Baa3 stable) 2070 net-zero target and intermediate goals through 2030 present significant policy implementation challenges for the government, carving a more central role for private companies and investors to drive the transition, according to a new report by Moody's. The country's high growth potential, significant economic development needs and large agricultural sector will likely weaken the government's policy resolve and financial capacity to drive the economy's carbon transition. As such, India's planned emissions reductions will be conditioned upon low-cost, long-term private capital,  Nishad Majmudar, Assistant Vice President and Analyst said.Many of the country's large private companies have announced net-zero targets that are well ahead of Indian authorities' goals, while the government-linked companies are comparatively behind. Additional policy signals to encourage transition would drive higher private investment. The pace of India's carbon transition will depend on the extent to which the government can balance energy affordability and reliability needs against its emissions reduction commitments,  said Abhishek Tyagi, Vice President and Senior Credit Officer. Reduced storage costs and the scalability of renewable projects with storage would support a faster transition,  added Tyagi.Indian banks' significant loans to carbon-intensive sectors expose them to transition risks, and they will face pressure to decarbonise their loan books. At the same time, green financing presents a significant lending opportunity, given banks' dominant role in credit intermediation in the country, Moody's said.",

        "articleBody": "While rapid electrification of the economy is going to be an important step towards decarbonising energy systems and enhancing efficiency levels, electricity cannot address certain carbon-intensive sectors which have to be decarbonised to ensure net-zero emissions. Hydrogen, as an energy carrier, is crucial for achieving decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors. Many sectors such as iron ore and steel, fertilisers, refining, methanol and maritime shipping emit major amounts of CO2, and carbon-free hydrogen will play a critical role in enabling deep decarbonisation.India is one of the early movers in the green hydrogen space. There are multiple reasons why India is pursuing this with vigour and conviction.Firstly, neither hydrogen nor electrolyser is a new technology. More than 70 million tons of hydrogen is produced annually across the world, with India clocking around 8% of global production.Secondly, India\u2019s distinct advantage in low-cost renewable-energy generation and world-class clean-power execution capabilities makes green hydrogen the most competitive form of hydrogen in the medium run. This enables India to be potentially one of the most competitive producers of green hydrogen in the world. Since 75% of the cost of green hydrogen is dependent on renewable energy, we should target to further bring down the cost of solar power to Rs 1 per Kw/h through lower cost of financing.Energy security is the third important reason to pursue green hydrogen as it will enable the emergence of a domestically produced energy carrier that can reduce the dependence on fossil fuel imports of $160 bn per year. In addition, with 500 GW renewables expected to come on line by 2030, green hydrogen could act as a solution to extract value out of excess renewable power and avoid the duck curve possibilities in the grid. Key policy measures for creating a green hydrogen ecosystem have recently been announced.Following are the three steps that will make India a leader in green hydrogen. Firstly, India should make urgent efforts to secure the time-limited export markets. The EU is quadrupling its green hydrogen import plans for 2030. There is huge potential for exports to EU, Japan and South Korea. Secondly, India should encourage industrial R&D in electrolysers and other green hydrogen components. Indian companies cannot be dependent on foreign technology suppliers.We need to industrialise next-generation hydrogen technologies in India.Thirdly, industrial applications such as refining and non-urea fertilisers have to be mandated to go 100% green hydrogen by 2030 to ensure economies of scale for this nascent industry to flourish. With these measures, the price of green hydrogen should fall from $4 per kg to $1 per kg by 2030. With proper policy support, industry action, market generation and increased investor interest, India can position itself as a low-cost, zero-carbon green hydrogen manufacturing hub of the world.",

        "articleBody": "When a diesel locomotive engine of the Indian Railways \u2014 identification number 40608 \u2014 was dispatched from its factory in Varanasi on June 6, 2019, it was not business as usual. As the engine chugged along, it was scripting history. It was the last fossil fuel-powered engine to be manufactured before the railways phased out diesel locomotives, a calibrated move to bring down the use of diesel in running trains in India.Today, the national transporter consumes about 2 billion litres of diesel annually (2021-22). But if GoI has its way, by 2030, it will be run entirely on electric power, that too, renewable energy. The railways\u2019 target is to build an installed capacity of 30 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy in the next eight years, reducing the yearly consumption of diesel to 0.2 billion litres, just enough for its reserve fleet of about 1,000 diesel locos that might be needed in emergency, e.g., natural disasters and wars. According to the railways\u2019 internal estimate, seen by ET, it will save 1.8 billion litres of diesel by 2029-30, which translates into a savings of Rs 16,250 crore ((base year: 2021-22)).The railways\u2019 renewable target, in fact, is only about 6% of India\u2019s ambitious goal of generating 500 GW (1 GW=1,000 MW) of alternative energy by 2030, up from 102 GW at present (153 GW, if hydel power is factored in). What\u2019s more, projects of 72 GW capacity are under implementation, while another set of projects to produce 21 GW are in the bidding stage, according to information provided by Union Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy RK Singh in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha last month. 90756745While India has already pencilled in the script for going green, the long war in Ukraine and its disastrous fallout on crude oil prices could only accelerate the process. Though global oil prices have eased a bit in the last few days (it skyrocketed to $140 a barrel last month), Indian crude oil basket price at $113 in March as against $85 in January is still too big, leading the government to back oil marketing companies\u2019 hiking of retail prices almost on a daily basis.GoI seems to be circumspect about what lies ahead. Even as New Delhi is celebrating $418 bn worth merchandise export in 2021-22, the highest ever for the nation, its trade deficit has also soared at a phenomenal pace, reaching $192 billion, a jump of 87% y-o-y, driven mainly by a surge in global prices of petroleum products. The Ukraine war as well as sanctions against oil and gas major Russia would mean an oil-consuming nation like India would continue to bear the brunt in the current fiscal year as well.While investments in EVs are pouring in, GoI is turning the spotlight on a newer and better option \u2014 green hydrogen.Future securityPower is required to generate hydrogen. When it is generated by renewable energy, it is termed green hydrogen. If conventional energy is deployed to make hydrogen, it is grey hydrogen, which leaves a bigger carbon footprint. Now, grey hydrogen is used for industrial purposes.\u201cFor India, shifting to green energy is important not only to address climate change but also for its own energy security,\u201d says Prof Ashutosh Sharma, former secretary in the department of science and technology, while explaining GoI\u2019s current position of pushing electric vehicles (EVs) as well as embracing a newer solution in green hydrogen. \u201cIndia has been experimenting with EVs but that is not sustainable in the long run. Use of batteries is not a green option. EV is, at best, a transitory phase. 90756760Ultimately, we have to move towards green hydrogen vehicles. We have to produce hydrogen by using renewable energy only,\u201d he adds.Amitabh Kant, CEO of the government think tank NITI Aayog and a votary of EVs, says India\u2019s roadmap must include a green hydrogen option.\u201cIndia\u2019s distinct advantage in low-cost renewable energy generation and worldclass clean power execution capabilities makes green hydrogen the most competitive form of hydrogen in the medium run,\u201d he says, adding that India is one of the early movers in the green hydrogen space.Meanwhile, car companies of late have lined up to announce their mega investment plans for EV, which has seen a major policy push since 2019. \u201cThe industry is committed to EVs.We are making significant investm e n t s in this direction,\u201d says V e n u Srinivasan, chairman of T V S M o t o r s, which has announced an investment plan of Rs 1,200 crore in future technologies as well as EVs over the next four years. Mahindra Group has also committed to invest over Rs 3,000 crore in the EV space. Its new range of EVs is set to be unveiled in July.India\u2019s largest car maker, Maruti Suzuki, too, has joined the EV bandwagon, albeit belatedly. Last month, the company announced it would be investing Rs 10,000 crore for making electric vehicles in India, apart from creating dedicated verticals for the purpose. RC Bhargava, chairman, says that the upfront cost of an EV is still a hindrance for car companies to shift their gears from making conventional cars to electric ones. While an entrylevel petrol car is priced at Rs 4 lakh, a lower-end EV starts at Rs 15 lakh. A comparative price for a green hydrogen car in India is not available as its commercial production has yet to kick-start. Last month, Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari hogged the limelight when he arrived at Parliament in a Toyota Mirai, India\u2019s first green hydrogen fuel cell-powered car. \u201cGreen vehicles do not mean EVs alone. There are transitional technologies such as CNG, bio-CNG, hybrid etc., that can help car companies go green faster,\u201d says Bhargava.While the sale of 11,623 units of electric passenger vehicles in India in calendar year 2021 is considered a landmark, the real shift of gears is taking place in the market of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers. Both the categories have significantly enlarged their footprints in the last one year. Sales of e-two wheelers, for instance, shot up by 419% y-o-y to 1.36 lakh units. The data for the first quarter (JanuaryMarch 2022) shows the industry has already clocked sales of 2.6 lakh e-two wheelers and 7,001 passenger vehicles, according to retail sales figures collated by Jato Dynamics.Vineet Mittal, chairperson of Avaada Energy, one of India\u2019s leading green and renewable energy companies, argues that the rising fuel costs triggered by international geopolitics and its resultant crude oil price rise could lead to more investments in newer technology such as green hydrogen. Jami Hossain, vice-president, technical chair of World Wind Energy Association (WWEA), seconds such a scenario. \u201cHydrogen as a gas can be stored and transported in a cylinder. This is a real game changer,\u201d says Hossain.\u201cGiven India\u2019s vast renewable resources, it can definitely take the lead in the generation of green hydrogen, which will not only reduce our oil requirements but also that of LNG and go a long way in helping address the energy needs of India, apart from providing a huge export opportunity,\u201d says Sumant Sinha, chairman and CEO of ReNew Power, which has recently inked a binding term sheet for a joint venture with Larsen & Toubro and government-run Indian Oil Corporation for supplying green hydrogen to industries.On the policy front, the Union ministry of power in February notified a green hydrogen/green ammonia policy to promote renewable energy generation\u2014 a major step in reducing the dependence on fossil fuels in India.This new power policy, the Ukraine war and the rising oil prices as well as Gadkari\u2019s display of the hydrogen car in Parliament have all coalesced into one scenario: GoI is serious about going green, ready to embrace newer technologies. The problem is how to minimise the duration of this unsettle transitory phase. Otherwise, both the government and India Inc may end up frittering away time and resources while chasing wrong technologies in transition.",

        "articleBody": "The country will need USD 17.77 trillion to meet its long term net-zero goals but it will have to find additional resources worth USD 12.4 trillion to complete the green journey, according to a study.If this funding gap is met from external sources then household spending will rise by USD 7.9 trillion, it added.According to a study by British lender Standard Chartered Bank, emerging markets, as a whole, will need an additional USD 94.8 trillion, an amount higher than their annual global GDP, if they are to meet climate goals without hitting their citizens' cost of living.India will need to find a funding gap of USD 12.4 trillion to meet net-zero goals of emissions, out of the USD 17.77 trillion it needs for the green journey, and if this finance is provided by developed markets, the household spending may rise by USD 7.9 trillion compared to self-financing, wherein household spending may fall by USD 5.8 trillion, the study said.The numbers are on top of the capital already allocated by respective governments under their current climate policies.Conversely, if emerging markets transition to a greener future without help from developed markets, household consumption in these markets could fall by 5 per cent on average each year, the report noted.The global journey to net-zero will help the world in its efforts to stave off the worst of climate change.The report is of the view that private investors can contribute as much as USD 83 trillion of the USD 94.8 trillion that is required, underscoring the urgent need for financial institutions to fulfil green and transition finance pledges.According to Standard Chartered estimate, India will need to invest an additional investment of USD 17.77 trillion to complete its journey to the net-zero level.Of this USD 8.5 trillion in its power sector, USD 6 trillion investment in energy efficiency -- including industry transport and buildings, USD 2.7 trillion investment to offset carbon tax revenues, household heating tax, and USD 573.3 billion in other public expenditure like an early unveiling of the scrappage policy and heating subsidies. This leads to a funding gap of USD 12.4 trillion.The world's top 300 investment firms with total assets under management of over USD 50 trillion have just 2 per cent, 3 per cent and 5 per cent of their investments in the Middle East, Africa and South America, respectively.The report argues that to transition in the fairest way possible, greater collaboration is required in strategy, policy, and financing. More importantly, banks need to live up to the pledges made during COP26 if ordinary households are to avoid bearing the costs of their market's transition to net-zero.The report goes on to argue that if emerging markets were to self-finance this gap, it will lead to higher taxes and an increase in government borrowings, meaning that some of the world's poorest people will have less to spend on their everyday needs. Households in these markets would be USD 2 trillion poorer on average each year. Between now and 2060, emerging market household consumption may come down by USD 79.2 trillion.On the other hand, if developed markets finance this gap, it can see emerging market household spending increase by USD 1.7 trillion on average each year and may also stimulate global growth -- GDP could be USD 108.3 trillion higher cumulatively between now and 2060. Emerging markets being able to reach net-zero without hampering their growth or prosperity would represent a just and fair transition.The lender is committed to reaching net-zero in its financed emissions by 2050, with interim targets for the most carbon-intensive sectors by 2030. The lender also plans to mobilise USD 300 billion in green and transition finance by 2030 to support the transition to net zero in the markets, Bill Winters, group chief executive at Standard Chartered said in the report.",

        "articleBody": "A global challenge requires global solutions. Climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying. We must take immediate and far-reaching action to avoid the devastating impacts of rising temperatures and not protect just ourselves but our future generations from the effects of climate change. We need countries, cities, states and businesses - to move onto a credible path to reach net zero globally in the coming decades. Collaboration between the UK and India will be crucial to tackling climate change.This is already happening and is evident from the various engagement and ministerial dialogues both countries have been having in recent months. The COP26 President, Alok Sharma, has visited India multiple times in the past year to discuss a wide spectrum of topics related to tackling climate change, along with progressing sustainable development and net-zero commitments. He said, \u201cThe absolute focus for the UK Presidency year is delivery. I echo this sentiment.\u201dThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II report released in February has shown the monumental climate risk, we face globally and how climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. The science is clear on this and urgent action is required to deal with increasing risks. The UK\u2019s Ten Point Plan and the Net-Zero strategy sets out how the UK will deliver on its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and focuses on areas to accelerate our path to net-zero \u2014 offshore wind, hydrogen, investing in carbon capture and finance, to name a few. COP26, the global climate conference held in Glasgow last November, was a significant achievement. Nearly 200 countries came together to forge the Glasgow Climate Pact to keep 1.5C alive. The commitments Prime Minister Modi made at COP26 also sent an inspiring signal. India committed to a net-zero carbon-emission target by 2070 and targets to meet 50 percent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. India can lead the world in pioneering a clean development path. Our two Prime Ministers also launched the \u2018Green Grids Initiative \u2013 One Sun One World One Grid\u2019 and \u2018Infrastructure for Resilient Island States\u2019 initiatives. India also signed up to the Glasgow Breakthroughs and the Zero Electric Vehicles Declaration under the emerging economies category. To ensure the Glasgow Climate Pact is brought to life, the UK is committed to working with India to reach its goals and is already facilitating British electric vehicle companies to set up manufacturing hubs in India.Ahead of COP26, the UK pledged $1 billion investment from British Investment International into Indian green projects over the next five years and announced a guarantee for $1 billion World Bank lending to India. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan launched the Clean Growth programme to encourage more UK exporters to tap into a sector expected to be worth \u00a31.8 trillion by 2030. The intent is to encourage clean growth businesses to start exporting their innovation globally. We also launched \u201cClimate Finance Leadership Initiative India\u201d, a private sector group led by Bloomberg and Tata, to move quickly to identify catalytic investments into Indian green projects.India and the UK already have a strong history of partnership on climate, ranging from knowledge exchange and innovation in areas like electric mobility and power sector reform to climate resilience. In May 2021, our Prime Ministers agreed to enhance the adoption of electric mobility. They also adopted an ambitious India-UK Roadmap to 2030 to steer cooperation for the next ten years. They emphasized that enhanced India-UK bilateral cooperation can not only reap mutual benefits but also be a global force for good to revive lives and livelihoods, promote peace and prosperity around the world and protect and preserve the planet for future generations. Given that climate is also one of the pillars of the India-UK 2030 Roadmap agreement, a continuous collaboration between the UK and India will be vital.Looking ahead, offshore wind is another foreseeable area to boost collaboration. The UK has installed more offshore wind capacity than any other country in the world. In 2020, our offshore wind generated 13% of total electricity in the UK, enough to supply the needs of 30% (10.8 Million) of UK homes. With India\u2019s ambitions to install 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030, India and the UK will definitely be natural partners.The UK is also investing in India\u2019s clean energy transition and mobilising public and private sector investment into green finance. The UK has invested over \u00a367 million to date in projects on solar energy, water, climate and more. Plus, the Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF), a joint investment of \u00a3120 million from both India and the UK, is now the largest single-country emerging market climate fund in the world. Together, this has enabled an additional installed capacity of 413 MW of renewable energy, mitigated 1.14 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, and created over 53,000 jobs.And there is an opportunity for the UK and India to work together to promote the clean growth agenda at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) where members, developed and developing economies alike, can discuss the mutually beneficial environmental and economic outcomes of sustainable trade, not least in the lead up to the Twelfth Ministerial Conference. In January, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Indian Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal launched negotiations on an ambitious Free Trade Agreement (FTA). An India-UK Free Trade Agreement would be a substantial opportunity for both of our economies and a significant moment in the India-UK bilateral relationship. While a deal between the UK and India will enable both economies to diversify and strengthen supply chains, one of the key areas that cannot be ignored is the unprecedented opportunity for green industries. An FTA would unlock opportunities for growth in our industries in areas such as offshore wind generation, electric vehicle manufacturing and carbon capture and storage. Here in Maharashtra, the Government is at the forefront of mainstreaming climate change across policy and planning. Mumbai is aiming to be the first city in India to achieve net zero by 2050 \u2013 this also makes it the first city in South Asia to set such a timeline. Mumbai has also launched a Climate Action Plan to support the city combat the effects of climate change in the coming decades. The state of Maharashtra recently awarded an EV bus contract to a British company, which will include investments in the infrastructure of the state. British and Indian businesses are already working together to support our nation\u2019s transition to a net zero economy. Harnessing the power of renewable energy will be key to this endeavour with the offshore wind a major focus for the UK and Indian governments and with India planning to install 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the end of 2022 and 500 GW by 2030.The UK already has the largest installed offshore wind capacity in the world, producing over 10 GW of energy. A figure we want to quadruple over the next decade. Our businesses can bring their capabilities and expertise to bear to support India\u2019s growing demands for green energy. Although India is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, this is an opportunity as much as a challenge. India has already taken impressive climate action. The spirit of partnership between India and the UK is just one example of cooperation in the global climate story. Together we can improve our common future and mobilise businesses, buyers, exporters and investors to seize opportunities. Please contact the UK\u2019s Department for International Trade (DIT) India team, to see how we can help your business supply solutions to net-zero world needs: SouthAsia.Trade@fcdo.gov.uk.",

        "articleBody": "India will be central to the world\u2019s development in the next twenty five years. The world\u2019s development, in turn, will be in large part determined by collective action to reduce the damage of climate change. So India will be an essential element of the world\u2019s sustainable future. That future, the world of our children and grandchildren, is being determined now. The economic consequences of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the harm to our planet outlined in the recent UN report on the effects of climate change, remind us of the scale of the challenge. They also remind us that most of these challenges are self-inflicted; caused by human activity. In that reality lies the solution \u2013 that with strong resolve, timely intervention and collective action, we can create a safer, fairer, more sustainable future. India has already made huge strides in climate action \u2013 quadrupling wind and solar capacity in the last decade as well as launching the National Hydrogen Mission. With most of the infrastructure that India will need for energy and other needs by 2040 yet to be built, it can lead the world in pioneering a clean development path. An accelerated and more ambitious shift to clean energy, including solar and wind deployment, provides the most effective route to ensuring climate and energy security, and improvements to our everyday lives. This shift will act to reduce emissions, wind down our dependence on fossil fuels and protect consumers and businesses from price volatility. Furthermore, it will provide new local job opportunities, energy access and cut the costs of living.Global support for a clean energy transition is greater than ever before. Two years ago, net-zero emissions targets applied to only 30% of the global economy. Today, over 90% of the global economy is covered by net-zero targets, including India. T UN COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow last year was a testament to collective action by nearly 200 countries, enshrined in the Glasgow Pact, in good part because of Prime Minister Modi\u2019s ambition. Countries agreed to revisit their emissions targets in 2022, to rapidly scale up climate finance and double finance for adaptation to climate change by 2025. For the first time, the COP decision included a commitment to scale down unabated coal power. Countries agreed to work together on the loss and damage to them. And we finalised all the outstanding elements of the rules by which countries will be held to account as they deliver on their targets.In 2015, the world was on course for a devastating increase of four degrees in warming by the end of this century. COP26 managed to turn that dial down to around a two-degree increase. It is still far too high but the world is heading in the right direction. The goal of restricting the growth in temperature to 1.5 degrees is alive but there is still a lot to be done. That\u2019s why the UK is focused on delivering the actions agreed at COP26, around four key goals. First, ensuring that promises on emissions reductions are kept, to keep global warming at manageable levels. Second, supporting climate-vulnerable countries by ensuring commitments on adaptation and damage are honoured. Third, to mobilise finance to support these efforts; the global goal of $100 billion in climate finance for developing countries remains a critical priority. Our final goal is to push for further action across critical sectors, such as coal, cars and ending deforestation, working with countries and partners. In all of this, we will work hand-in-hand with Egypt, the COP27 Presidency. India is a hugely important partner on the climate agenda. Prime Minister Modi showed decisive leadership at the COP26 World Leader\u2019s Summit with new 2030 commitments to supply half of India\u2019s energy needs with renewables and announcing a 2070 net-zero target. These commitments set a clear direction for businesses and innovators, states and cities around a goal of clean growth.When India and the UK, two countries of different sizes at different stages of development, come together this benefits each other and the world. Both countries share a capacity for innovation and have a strong partnership spanning smart power, renewables, energy efficiency and electric mobility. To support its delivery, the UK is working with India through an \u201cIndia Green Guarantee\u201d to the World Bank to unlock an additional $1 billion for green projects across India. This will help turn promises into practice. The UK and India are also part of global initiatives like the COP26 Energy Transition Council and Zero Emission Vehicles Transition Council - to make clean technologies the best and most affordable option and attract a doubling in the rate of investment in clean power and in the pace of the global transition to zero-emission vehicles by 2030. Our joint research and innovation partnerships in areas like electric mobility and offshore wind will generate new solutions to power green growth. The UK is also a proud member of the India-led International Solar Alliance (ISA), which aims to mobilise more than $1 trillion of investments in solar energy by 2030. To ensure that nobody is left behind in the transition, the UK is also a founding member of the India-led global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), which at COP26 launched the \u2018Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS)\u2019 initiative to enable a more sustainable and resilient approach to infrastructure in some of the most climate-vulnerable parts of the world.The scientific and economic case for energy transition is clear. The world is on average 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than in pre-industrial times. We are already witnessing the acute effects of this on millions of people in India and across the world through extreme weather events. If emissions are not cut, India faces the possibility of catastrophic heat, the highest flooding costs in the world, and widespread food and water scarcity. Our actions today will shape the future our children will inherit and our capacity to adapt to increasing climate risks.COP26 in Glasgow achieved substantial progress but we must follow up with collective action. It is time for India and the UK to boost collaboration on climate action and deliver upon those ambitious targets to pave the way for a healthier, sustainable and prosperous future.",

        "articleBody": "From curbing emissions to increasing forest cover, India has often boasted about making progress toward its pledges under the 2015 Paris climate change accord. But officials have kept quiet about one target lately: boosting renewable energy.That may be intentional. With the pandemic halting work and projects hitting logistics snags, India is on track to miss its goal of increasing renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts by the end of 2022. Solar and wind alone account for 160 gigawatts and the country could fall 36% short of that figure, BloombergNEF estimates.The potentially disappointing numbers offer insight into structural problems facing India on its journey to decarbonization. Domestic power suppliers, which control nearly 90% of electricity transactions, are struggling to stem losses and shrink a pile of debt. That crimps their ability to buy enough power to service customers, resulting in delayed payments to power producers and stifling growth across the industry.Financial distress in state retailers is a major reason why this year\u2019s target seems out of reach. Many projects auctioned by the federal government have struggled to find buyers, people familiar with the matter said. About a quarter of wind projects awarded in auctions so far have failed to take off due to problems related to distribution utilities, according to BloombergNEF. \u201cWe need to stop depending on state power distribution companies to expand green capacity,\u201d said Debasish Mishra, a Mumbai-based partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. \u201cAs long as we keep depending on these utilities, our climate targets will be at risk.\u201dThe country\u2019s renewable energy ministry didn\u2019t respond to emailed questions.India is seeking to revamp its fossil fuels-driven economy by expanding renewable energy and embracing new technologies like green hydrogen and green ammonia. Some parts of the country have been driven to extremes in the quest to provide affordable energy to citizens.In 2019, the southern state of Andhra Pradesh decided that it was paying too high a price for clean energy. After years of litigation, the local high court recently ruled in favor of power developers. The state\u2019s decision was a setback for investors, though it has helped restore faith that they\u2019re shielded from retroactive tariff changes, said Shantanu Jaiswal, the head of BNEF in India.\u201cThe main reason that we have fallen behind the target is that there have been too many policy changes,\u201d said Pinaki Bhattacharyya, the chief executive officer of Amp Energy India, a solar power developer. \u201cThis is a business where you have to make most of the investment upfront. If there\u2019s a policy change that impacts the cost, that is something that will slow down the sector.\u201dConfusion over taxes is common. A recent increase in India\u2019s national sales rates, as well as the imposition of import tariffs, have created uncertainty about costs. Last September, the country raised the goods and services tax on renewable energy equipment from 5% to 12%, causing an unexpected headache for developers. In 2019, India started imposing tariff barriers to protect domestic makers of cells and modules, levying a safeguard tax on imports. The renewable energy ministry said a new customs tax would take effect as soon as the safeguard duty expired in July 2020. But companies including the Adani Group sought an extension of the duty.For weeks, developers remained in doubt about new import tax rates. Earlier this year, Scatec ASA said it had put on hold 900 megawatts of solar projects in India due to low domestic module supplies and a 40% customs duty which will be imposed starting in April. The Norwegian power company had partnered with India\u2019s Acme Solar Holdings to build the projects. To finesse its renewables numbers, India\u2019s government has started counting hydropower projects bigger than 25 megawatts, though the original target only accounted for solar, wind, smaller hydropower projects and biomass. The country had 152.9 gigawatts of renewable power capacity at the end of February, including 46.5 gigawatts from large hydroelectric plants, the power minister, R.K. Singh, told lawmakers in March. He said another 72.6 gigawatts were at different phases of implementation.Still, that doesn\u2019t change the distance India needs to cover, especially if it wants to meet another goal of 500 gigawatts of non-fossil power generation by the end of the decade. Prime Minister Narendra Modi set that stretch target at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, U.K., in November.\u201cIndia\u2019s ambitious target helped the country grab the attention of global investors, but it now needs to fix some fundamental problems,\u201d BloombergNEF\u2019s Jaiswal said. \u201cWithout that, the country may not be able to meet its targets for 2030.\u201d ",

        "articleBody": "The central and state governments are likely to trade more than half a million diesel and petrol cars with electric vehicles, but a lack of choice with just one model that fits the bill is posing a constraint to the plan, a senior government official said.Electric versions of the Tata Tigor and Tata Nexon are the only India-made EVs that come within the price range that the government targets. Among these two, only one meets the requirements of the government currently.The government would want to see a choice of models before floating a tender, said Mahua Acharya, managing director of Convergence Energy Services Ltd (CESL), the state-run company that handles the acquisition of EVs for central and state government departments. We want to induct more (electric) cars because governments (state and central) are changing their fleet. There is only one car in the range that is generally affordable by government, and this one too has a waiting period,\u201d she said, adding that there were more than 600,000 government (Centre and states combined) vehicles.\u201c(In) four wheelers, we do not have enough models right now. I am looking forward to this new set of models coming along, as they (carmakers) have promised to launch in the next 12 months or earlier,\u201d Acharya said.The shift to electric cars and SUVs by government departments could generate a business of Rs 65,000-70,000 crore in the next three years for the EV industry, according to an ETIG analysis.In fact, the Centre is aiming for a transition to electric across automobile segments, right from two-wheelers to trucks, and its plans include setting up charging infrastructure and even incentivising vehicle makers to produce EVs locally. CESL has created an online marketplace for two wheelers, called MyEV.com.A tender for 5,580 electric buses that CESL has floated is set to generate close to Rs 5,500 crore of business. Another for 100,000 three-wheelers is expected to be worth about Rs 3,000 crore. But the biggest pie will come from passenger vehicles.Manufacturers are also gearing up for the opportunity, as public adoption of EVs is also growing. In the coming three-four years, about a dozen new locally manufactured electric passenger vehicles are expected to hit the roads, from the likes of Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, MG Motor, Hyundai Motor and Kia.Tata Motors will be bringing EVs below its existing range of Tigor and Nexon, including an all-new Tiago, Punch and Altroz EVs. Also, it will launch the Nexon EV with a 400-km range in less than a week\u2019s time.On the electric buses front, all the bids have been already submitted and will be opened any time soon, said Acharya.Suppliers of electric buses to state transport undertakings under the latest tender need to ensure the quality and efficient operation of the buses. These buses will be deployed in Delhi, Bengaluru, Surat, Hyderabad and Kolkata.On three-wheelers, Acharya said the government was able to secure the fleet with a price reduction of 18-25%, based on the variety of goods and payload requirements.\u201cWe have been working to enable those vehicles to come on the road. Nearly 50% of the demand has come from public agencies, and the rest from private aggregators,\u201d she said.The company also attempted the aggregation exercise for two-wheelers, but due to the wide variety of options available, it decided to create a marketplace.\u201cGovernments are using MyEV.org to make purchases. And there are a number of financial institutions which have been empanelled. So, government employees can choose their bike,\u201d she said.Acharya said the government was moving very rapidly to mobility as a service.\u201cThe market for public mobility is going to be electric. It is just cheaper. Of course, from the climate point of view, it is an absolute imperative,  she added.",

        "articleBody": "Plans to build a sprawling solar park on land cultivated for generations by indigenous farmers in India's Himalayan foothills erupted in violent clashes with police last year after their crops were bulldozed for the development.  Most men from the farming village of a few hundred in Assam state were out looking for work on Dec. 29. One of the few people who remained was Champa Timungpi, who says she was beaten by police and kicked in the stomach when she tried to protest.  Pregnant at the time, the 25-year-old was rushed to a hospital for her injuries.  I came back home at night, and I miscarried,  said Tumungpi, who lodged a complaint with police. The lush green village in Nagaon district - still largely unconnected to the grid and home to families who earn less than $2 a day - is now framed by blue solar panels, barbed wire and armed guards.  The solar developer Azure Power, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, said in an email that the company legally bought 91 acres (38 hectares) in the village from  recorded landowners  and it's  incorrect and erroneous  to say the land was forcibly taken.  The company's position is strongly disputed by Timungpi and others in the Mikir Bamuni village who say their rights as tenants and established farmers were ignored. Local officials and police didn't respond to requests for comment.  However it plays out in a district court, the dispute not only speaks to India's often-tangled land ownership rules rooted in its colonial era. It also illustrates the complexity and immensity of the challenges facing the country of nearly 1.4 billion people in meeting its renewable power goals for the next decade. Over the next 20 years, India's demand for electricity will grow more than anywhere else in the world. Unlike most countries, India still has to develop and lift millions like Timungpi from poverty, and it will need to build a power system the size of the European Union's.  How India meets its energy and economic needs will have an outsized impact on the world's climate goals. The country is a major contributor of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at last year's United Nation climate talks that India would increase its capacity of non-fossil fuels electricity to 500 gigawatts by 2030 - from the 104 gigawatts at the start of this year. To meet its goals, India must add four times the amount of power the average nuclear plant produces - every month until 2030. These short-term energy targets won't do much to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius (34.7 Fahrenheit) - the level beyond which scientists warn of catastrophic climate impacts, scientists at last year's United Nations climate conference had warned. But for India, it'll still be a  gargantuan task,  requiring investments between $20 billion and $26.8 billion, while only $10 billion is available, a parliamentary committee said last month.  Some obstacles to renewables - such as the need to build electricity storage for when the sun isn't shining or wind isn't blowing - are global challenges. Others are more specific to India - such as the question of who owns land in poor communities that bear least responsibility for the climate crisis and the need to realign power systems that have relied on coal for centuries. While there's no clear roadmap yet for India's renewable energy push, experts cite a federal report last year that said an optimal mix would be getting more than half the country's power from the sun and wind by 2030. But big solar and wind facilities are sparking conflicts with local communities. This is partly because land ownership is fuzzy at many project sites. For example, some communities have used land for centuries to farm or graze cattle without legal rights over it.  As governments and companies focused on transitioning away from fossil fuels, such conflicts were  collaterals  that had to be managed, Kanchi Kohli, an environmental researcher at the Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research.  Mandatory environmental impact assessments were waived for solar and wind projects to make them more viable. But environmental issues still have arisen.  For instance, India's Supreme Court in April 2021 ordered that transmission lines for solar energy be put underground after environmentalists reported the lines were killing critically endangered great Indian bustards. Nine months later, the federal government said burying the lines to safeguard the birds would be too costly and would impede green energy development. The court is hearing the matter again. India could reduce its dependence on large solar parks by building solar panels on roofs in cities.  The country's initial rooftop goals were small, but in 2015 it set a target of 40 gigawatts of rooftop solar, enough to power 28 million homes. Customers were allowed to send electricity back to the grid - and the sector grew.  In December 2020, the federal government changed rules restricting large industries and businesses from sending electricity back to the grid. These commercial groups are among the highest paying customers for India's perennially cash-strapped power distribution companies, which lost over $5 billion in 2020.  With industries sending electricity back to the grid in the evening when demand and power tariffs are highest, distribution companies were losing their best customers said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.   They were losing money,  Garg said. The installation cost makes rooftop solar too expensive for most homeowners. That was the case for Siddhant Keshav, 30, a New Delhi entrepreneur, who wanted to put solar panels on his home.  It just didn't make sense,  he said. Homes comprised less than 17% of India's rooftop solar in June 2021, according to a report by Bridge to India, a renewable energy consulting firm. And India has only managed to achieve 4% of its 2022 rooftop solar target. Wind could become another important element in India's clean energy portfolio. But the most  attractive, juicy, windy sites  have small turbines using old technology, said Gagan Sidhu, the director of energy finance at think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water.  By retiring old wind turbines built before 2002, India could unlock a capacity of 1.5 gigawatts, according to a 2017 study by Indo-Germany Energy Forum, the consulting firm Idam Infra and India's renewable energy ministry. But experts said it's unclear who would do the retrofitting and pay the bill. With a coastline of over 4,670 miles (about 7,500 kilometers), India could potentially build enough offshore wind farms to provide roughly a third of the country's 2021 electricity capacity by 2050, according to an assessment led by the Global Wind Energy Council.  But these are very expensive to build - and the first such project, a wind farm proposed for the Arabian Sea in 2018, has yet to get underway.",

        "articleBody": "Rating agency ICRA on Tuesday said there are strong demand prospects for renewable energy projects in the commercial and industrial segment but regulatory risks pose challenges.  The demand prospects for RE (Renewable Energy) capacity addition by Commercial & Industrial (C&I) segment are expected to remain solid, given the improved tariff competitiveness and strong sustainability/green initiatives by C&I players to meet their energy requirements through renewables.  The C&I segment itself accounts for about 40 to 45 per cent share in all India energy demand.  In a statement, ICRA said that even assuming 20 per cent of the energy requirements are to be met by C&I segment through RE, the RE capacity addition requirement is estimated to remain significant at about 75 GW by 2030.  As per the recent report published by ICRA on RE sector, Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head - Corporate ratings at ICRA, said,  from the C&I off-taker's perspective, cost of sourcing of RE through open access remains at discount to grid tariffs after factoring the applicable open access charges.   The grid tariffs have shown a rise and the energy charge in the same also varies widely between Rs 6-7/unit and Rs 6-10/unit for HT industrial and commercial segment respectively, across the states, he stated.  Nonetheless, the regulatory risk remains a challenge for open access-based RE projects due to dependency on open access and banking requirements, he noted.  The open access and banking charges/norms also vary widely with effective cost ranging between Rs 1.5 to 5/unit across key states, with an increasing trend seen due to upward pressure on cost of power supply and continued high level of cross subsidisation in the tariff structure for the discoms, he added.  The open access charges mainly comprise Cross Subsidy Surcharge (CSS), additional surcharge, wheeling charges and banking charges as per the applicable norms by State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERCs).  The CSS varies widely between Rs 0.7 to 2.2/unit as observed across the key states, with the removal of concessions/exemptions by SERCs -- which were earlier available for RE projects in third party open access route, it stated.  Vikram V, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, said recent directive by Supreme Court for non-applicability of additional surcharge for captive projects, however, remains a positive for captive RE projects.  The clarity on the extent of waiver of inter-state transmission charges for projects to be commissioned by FY 2028 also remains a positive, he added.  According to ICRA, credit profile of the majority of the rated RE entities having third party/ group captive PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) continue to remain supported by availability of long-term PPAs with the creditworthy C&I customers, adequate liquidity buffer, support availability from the respective sponsor groups as well as strengths arising from operating track record.  Further, it noted that the outlook for the RE sector remains stable, aided by the strong policy thrust, an improved tariff competitiveness of both solar & wind energy as well as supportive regulatory framework.",

        "articleBody": "If all goes according to plan, India will be dead last among the world\u2019s biggest economies to zero out greenhouse gas emissions. And that\u2019s precisely as it should be.India\u2019s target date to reach net-zero is 2070. That\u2019s two decades after the far wealthier U.S. and Europe. And it includes an additional 10-year cushion separating it from its neighbor China\u2019s 2060 goal. Trying for more severe cuts to emissions much sooner could leave millions of Indians struggling for access to basic staples, including the delivery of more air conditioning to a nation that\u2019s extremely vulnerable to heat waves. In fact, India\u2019s challenges maintaining its fragile electric grid under the ever-increasing demand fueled by warming temperatures is a matter of life and death.\u201cThe challenge is fundamentally different for a country on the upward slope of emissions than for a country on the downward slope of emissions,\u201d says Navroz Dubash, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research, in New Delhi.For India, with its historically minor responsibility for planet-warming pollution, there\u2019s a goal more urgent than taming climate change: lifting millions out of poverty over the next few decades. While American drivers choose from electric pickup trucks, eventually decreasing demand for oil, India is struggling to reduce its growing bill for imported fuel. While British policymakers craft subsidies to retrofit old houses for energy efficiency, India\u2019s focus is on ensuring energy bills are as low as possible. And while New Zealand burnishes its climate standing by slashing methane emissions from its cattle farms, India still has to feed its growing population of 1.4 billion as more extreme weather events threaten agriculture.\u201cThe question becomes,\u201d Dubash says, \u201chow do you extract the most development per unit of carbon?\u201dChina\u2019s development path is not a particularly useful precedent. Yes, the two countries both have billion-plus populations. But the world\u2019s No. 2 economy is the largest manufacturer of solar panels, lithium-ion batteries, and electric vehicles. China is also, by far, the top installer of offshore wind turbines, hydrogen electrolyzers, new nuclear power, and high-voltage cables that can carry renewable power from sunny and windy areas in the west to populated centers in the east. India has yet to build the capacity to manufacture any of these green technologies at scale; so far it\u2019s mastered deploying only solar panels and onshore wind turbines.To meet their climate goals, all governments have to find ways to make economic growth catalysts less carbon-intensive. But India is the only lower-middle-income country among the five biggest global emitters. \u201cIn planning an alternative pathway, India doesn\u2019t have any role models in another country,\u201d says Ulka Kelkar, climate program director at the World Resources Institute India.The sometimes contradictory effort to escape from poverty without rejecting the global push for decarbonization can make India\u2019s ambitions hard to parse. Last year\u2019s COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, was bookended by moments in which India played champion and spoiler. The event began with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s surprise net-zero announcement, finally aligning all 10 of the world\u2019s largest economies\u2014and 46% of the planet\u2019s population\u2014behind the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Congratulatory messages poured in from world leaders. But COP26 ended on a sour note, with some small island nations under existential jeopardy from sea-level rise blaming India for successfully scrapping, at the last minute, a global commitment to phase out the use of coal. India\u2019s environment ministry didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Part of the problem is that India not only needs to grow more quickly than other super-emitters, but it\u2019s also one of the most affected by increasingly extreme weather. That means urgent investment is needed to adapt to a warmer planet, with curbing pollution sometimes becoming a secondary consideration. India\u2019s first official assessment of climate change, published in 2020, showed that the frequency and intensity of droughts and cyclones had significantly increased in the last six decades. The number of days of intense rainfall and the pace at which sea levels are rising have more than doubled over that period. A single extreme weather event, Cyclone Amphan in 2020, affected 13 million people in India and wrought $13 billion in damage.The future looks even more terrifying. Under the worst-case warming scenarios, India is set to experience four times as many heat waves by the end of the century as it does now. Declining agricultural productivity and rising food prices will hit sooner, pushing 50 million people below the poverty line by 2040, according to the Overseas Development Institute.If India in the near term needs to rely on cheap fossil fuels, that leaves open an enormous question: What does a trajectory to net-zero look like inside a nation whose escape from lower-middle-income status over the next generation will need to coincide with global decarbonization? How India goes about achieving its climate targets will look distinctively different from the efforts being pursued by the U.S., Europe, and China. This is especially true if India walks down the path to net-zero without much foreign financial support.\u201cNo one has come forward with constructive offers of support to help India meet its climate goals,\u201d says Kanika Chawla, program manager at UN Energy, which coordinates energy-related issues across the United Nations. Developed countries failed to deliver on their promise to provide $100 billion in annual climate funding by 2020 to help developing nations. At COP26, meanwhile, India demanded $1 trillion in aid over the next decade\u2014just for itself\u2014before it could meet its 2070 target.Without a wave of financial support from abroad, India will likely rely on homegrown tools that have lowered energy consumption and the cost of living for millions of its people. In this way the poorest super-emitter on the planet might become the role model it never had for the rest of the developing world\u2014testing and perfecting a playbook for the most cost-effective strategies to reap climate benefits without setting back the primary need, to defeat poverty.Two and Three, not FourIn a market where cars remain a luxury, India\u2019s push to electrify transport has focused on scooters, motorized bicycles, and rickshaws. By 2030 more than 80% of the two-wheelers sold in the country could be battery-powered, according to Nitin Gadkari, minister for road transport and highways. Today almost half of all three-wheelers sold are electric, says Rishabh Jain of the New Delhi-based nonprofit Council on Energy, Environment and Water. Battery swapping for smaller vehicles is becoming popular in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and other space-constrained, crowded cities.Energy-Saving FactoriesInstead of a carbon market that makes companies pay for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit\u2014such as the one governed by the European Union\u2014India in 2008 launched a program that forced energy-intensive industries to become more efficient. Companies that use less energy than set targets can trade the savings as credits. Cutting energy use means reducing carbon emissions, too. The program saved 87 million metric tons of CO2 in 2020, about the same as Bangladesh\u2019s annual footprint, and many everyday goods are adorned with energy-efficiency labels showing how well they conserve power. Lightbulbs That Cut BillsThe Gram Ujala initiative, named using the Hindi words for \u201crural lights,\u201d offers subsidized LED lights to villagers. The bulbs, as many as 5 million of which were distributed last year, are many times more efficient than traditional incandescent alternatives. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency says Gram Ujala and other measures targeting home appliances saved $4 billion in electricity and cut emissions by 46 million tons in 2020.Cleaner CookingAir pollution generated indoors kills 1.7 million Indians each year and causes $37 billion of economic losses, according to a Global Burden of Disease study. A major contributor to noxious air in the home is the burning of firewood for heat and cooking. Switching more than 88 million poor households to liquefied petroleum gas since 2016 has significantly reduced the health risks associated with pollution. It\u2019s also saved women from hours of collecting wood. Although the change slightly increased India\u2019s emissions, \u201cthe development gains are so big that it\u2019s just a no-brainer,\u201d says the Centre for Policy Research\u2019s Dubash. Eventually, similar programs could be used to shift to electricity or a carbon-free gas for cooking.Solar and Wind BoomCoal contributes to more than 70% of all Indian electricity generation. But solar power, which has become the cheapest source of new power, is growing fast. The country aims to install 175 gigawatts of renewable energy, three times the amount currently deployed in the U.K., in 2022. While India might fall slightly short of that target because of the economic hit from the pandemic, Modi is setting his sights even higher. He wants green power capacity to reach 500GW by the end of the decade. Billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani are looking to invest $76 billion and $50 billion, respectively, in the sector.India\u2019s energy transition has been held back by the high cost of capital, with companies often finding it harder to tap international financial markets than their Western peers. There are three solutions to high borrowing costs, says Ajay Mathur of the Energy and Resources Institute: The government can get sovereign loans from international financial institutions such as the World Bank, better manage foreign exchange risks, and boost links with other green markets that could make it easier to raise cash for an expansion of renewables.But India can also think bigger. Its cities are growing and industrialization is happening so rapidly that the country has a rare opportunity, Dubash says. Unlike rich countries that have to slowly replace existing infrastructure, a developing country such as India can reimagine how it builds cities and industries from scratch. It can avoid locking in an emissions-heavy future.\u201cYou have a lot more decisions to make and many more alternative futures,\u201d Dubash says. \u201cBut that also increases the complexity and cost of realizing those futures.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Lack of professionals with standardised skillset in environmental, social and governance (ESG) domain is proving to be a major roadblock for India to realise its net zero emission goals by 2050, according to experts. As per Think Change Forum, an independent think tank, the size of ESG investments in India ranges from USD 30-40 billion and is growing rapidly.  To make quick all-round progress, ESG adopters in India need the right financial resources, technical resources, and human resources in the form of ESG professionals and experts.   While progress has been made on the first two aspects, challenges with respect to a pipeline of ESG experts and human resources need urgent attention,  Think Change Forum said in a statement.  Taking part in a roundtable organised by the think tank, Kumar Subramanian, Founding Partner and Managing Director, Sculpt Partners, a sustainability centric advisory firm, said, Over the years, in India, we seem to have made some progress as far as sustainable financing and technology are concerned, but today, we really need to jump-start the process of creating a pool of skilled ESG professionals who can work at the cross-section of business and sustainability.   As is the case with many mission-critical enterprise agendas, progression on ESG matters requires a combination of financial capital, technology, as well as investments in human capital, he added.  Expressing similar views, Larsen & Toubro Ltd Head Corporate Sustainability Pradeep Panigarhi said as far as ESG targets are concerned, there is a need to have the  right expertise within the team .   You need to build real expertise; just giving training or introducing another capacity-building programme doesn't help. You need to understand the nitty-gritty of the business. Then only things work,  Panigarhi added.  Purnamita Dasgupta, Chair Professor and Head, Environmental and Resource Economics Unit, Institute of Economic Growth, pointed out that while it may be easier for large-cap companies to progress in certain areas like ESG, it may not be possible for smaller enterprises to do so.   The key question is, how do MSMEs cope with the situation, and how do we really bring them into the ESG fold? While there are a lot of opportunities, opportunities become important when we are able to place them in context,  Dasgupta said.  Think Change Forum said considering the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to find creative solutions that can equip existing professionals to work on the ESG agenda in the short term and and in the long term, industries and academia work in close collaboration to develop a pool of ESG talent that is industry absorbable.   For instance, the clean energy sector alone would require more than 100 million professionals globally over the next 10-20 years. The number constitutes more than 3 per cent of the total global employable workforce that we have today. So, a mix of immediate and long-term measures is required to address the acute shortage of ESG professionals,  it said.  The availability of skilled and trained ESG professionals in India will also lead to a large number of small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which play an important role in employment generation and the overall economy, have access to the required talent, and set and achieve ESG targets, the think tank said.   The current set of consultants in the field are untested and do not have a standardised skillset. Further, expert agencies operating in the space offer their services at very high rates, making it impossible for small business entities to afford them,  it added.",

        "articleSection": "Industry",
        "articleBody": "Four months after India announced its  net-zero  target at the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, the country has yet to submit its targets for cutting greenhouse emissions, underscoring the difficulty of overhauling energy policy amid a growing population.  When asked about the delay during an unrelated event in the capital New Delhi on Tuesday, Indian environment minister Bhupender Yadav downplayed it, saying that several ministries were still discussing the matter to chart out a roadmap.  India's Ministry of Environment, which drafts the targets and submits them to the UN Climate Agency, and the country's top federal official in the Ministry of Power, did not respond to requests for comment this week.   We don't have time anymore  to wait for all countries to start reducing emissions, said New Climate Institute scientist Niklas Hohne, who tracks emission pledges for Climate Action Tracker. Hohne added that it would be useful if India specified targets achievable with its own resources and formulated a clear plan for what could achieved with financial help from other nations.  During November's conference in Glasgow, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his nation would stop adding greenhouses gases to the atmosphere by 2070 -- two decades after the U.S., and 10 years after China. He said that India would increase its current capacity for non-fossil fuel electricity to 500 gigawatts and use energy from clean sources to meet half of its needs. Modi also said that India would cut carbon emissions by a billion tons compared with the previous target and reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45%. Since these 2030 targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions haven't yet been submitted to the U.N. climate agency, they can't yet be counted towards the global effort. India is not the only country to be slow to turn in targets. The 2015 Paris agreement on climate, which India signed, required countries to submit their climate targets, called Nationally Determined Contributions, by the end of 2020. Many nations missed that deadline. The more urgent deadline was to get submission in before the November negotiations in Glasgow and most nations did. Of the five top emitting nations, only India has not submitted its plans.  The delays underscore the challenges that India faces in achieving these goals. A parliamentary committee calculated that India would require over $20 billion in investment to meet its clean energy targets while only half of that was available - prompting the opposition to ask the government whether it formulated a clear roadmap before committing internationally.  India's role is key for the world's climate targets. It has the third-highest emissions in the world, after China and the United States, and its energy needs are expected to grow faster than any other country in the coming decades. At the same time, historically it has contributed least to the world's cumulative emissions among the group of 20 industrial nations known as the G20.  The typical American, for instance, uses 16 times more electricity than the average Indian, according to data from the World Bank. Many in the South Asian country of 1.4 billion residents still live in poverty and its leaders have consistently argued that it needs the  carbon space  to grow. Even in the most optimistic scenario, some of India's future energy needs will have to be met through coal -- the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.  This was partly why the country had demanded a last-minute change to crucial language during the U.N. climate conference to  phase down  rather than  phase out  coal power. India said that developing countries were  entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels  for their growth and blamed  unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns  of rich countries for the current climate catastrophe. In any case, India faces the same reality that other nations do: Unless emissions are drastically reduced, large parts of the world will become uninhabitable due to climate shocks like deadly fires, floods, and unlivable heat, a new U.N. report said Monday. The country lost $87 billion in 2020 because of natural disasters like cyclones, floods and droughts, according to the World Meteorological Organization. At Glasgow, Modi had stressed that India's goals couldn't be achieved without adequate climate finance, a stand that India has long reiterated, and called for rich countries to provide $1 trillion in help.  The lack of finance is a vital stumbling block, said Harjeet Singh, an advisor with the Climate Action Network International. He said that if he were to put himself in the shoes of a finance minister of a developing country like India,  How do I do it if I don't see a stream of funding? Rich countries are failing in their commitment.  Singh said that there was some hope in the plan announced by the U.S., Britain, France and Germany to provide $8.5 billion in loans and grants over five years to help South Africa phase out coal, a source of 90% of its electricity. But he added that it remained to be seen if that money would make it to those most impacted. India's opposition parliamentarians criticized the government for not consulting with chief ministers or state leaders before announcing India's net-zero targets in December in the parliament. Parliamentarian Kanimozhi Karunanidhi said that India had only a fraction of the solar energy needed to meet what had been promised at Glasgow.   I want to know how can we achieve so much? What we've done is nothing compared to what we've promised to the world,  said Karunanidhi, from Thoothukkudi in Tamil Nadu.",

We will work in a unified way to not only achieve our goals but we will also show the way to humanity,\u201d Modi said at the plenary session of a webinar on \u201cEnergy for Sustainable Growth\u201d. Addressing participants across public and private sectors, he said India\u2019s sustainable growth is possible only with sustainable energy sources. He said all families can have their own solar tree in open space which can help in 10-15% reduced energy conservation.He said innovations are required in the areas of clean cooking and solar cooking can be a big market for start-ups.He sought inputs from the webinar on implementation of Rs 19,500 crore solar manufacturing scheme, green hydrogen mission and energy storage initiatives announced in Union Budget 2022. A  National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules  was approved in 2021 to promote manufacturing of high efficiency solar PV modules, including the upstage vertical components like solar PV cells, wafers, ingots, polysilicon. Nearly 9 GW capacity of fully integrated solar PV module manufacturing units for Rs 4,500 crore of initial allocation has been awarded. An additional outlay of Rs 19,500 crore was announced in the Budget 2022-23to set up about 40GW of solar module manufacturing capacity.The proposed National Hydrogen Mission seeks to evolve a framework for demand creation, support for indigenous manufacturing, research and development, pilot projects in emerging areas, and an enabling ecosystem of policies, regulations and standards. The proposed measures are expected to scale up production, use and export of Green Hydrogen and its derivatives. India has a target of installing about 300 GW of solar power capacity by 2030. A sectoral group on resources comprising the ministries of power; petroleum and natural gas; new and renewable energy; coal; mines; external affairs; and environment forest and climate change is organising the Webinar on \u201cEnergy for Sustainable Growth\u201d. The Webinar will have three different sessions. The concluding session will be chaired by power and new and renewable energy minister R K Singh.",

        "articleBody": "India today is the world's fourth largest renewable energy (RE) country and fifth largest in terms of installed solar capacity. In early February, solar installations crossed the 50 GW milestone, making India only the fifth country to achieve this. In August 2021, India achieved 100 GW of installed RE capacity and in December 2021 it became only the fourth country to have 150GW of RE (including large hydro). Today, India is home to one of the world's largest energy transition programmes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP26 announced that India is expanding its RE target to 500 GW by 2030. With only nine years to go to meet the ambitious target, the budget 2022 has given the much-needed impetus to place Indian RE sector at an advantage. The provisions for renewable energy in this budget are based on four key pillars:Swavalamban: The PM gave the clarion call for self-reliant India (Atmanirbhar Bharat) in 2020. In line with this, the government announced a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for high efficiency solar manufacturing in India. The outlay for this scheme has been increased by \u20b919,500 crore, taking the total outlay to around $3 billion. The increase is likely to boost manufacturing capabilities and add at least 45 GW of domestic manufacturing in the next three years, making India a global solar manufacturing hub. A basic customs duty of 25% and 40% on imported solar cells and modules was also announced while extending the concessional tax regime of 15% until March 2024. Samruddhi: This year's budget has aggressively pushed the development curve of RE sector. Sovereign green bonds will cement India's already existing reputation as world's attractive destination for RE investments. The move to allow a fiscal deficit of 4% of GSDP of which 0.5% will be tied to power sector reforms will go a long way to bring more accountability in the RE sector. Sashaktikaran: The provision of decentralised RE and support for livelihood generation for border villages is a right step in empowering rural population. MNRE has recently released a framework for promotion of decentralised renewable energy livelihood applications to create an enabling ecosystem for spread of renewable energy generation technologies. The inclusion of hydro and solar power projects in the budget for the Ken-Betwa link project would integrate agriculture and RE sectors while contributing significantly to doubling the farmers' income.Shakti: PM GatiShakti is a transformative approach for growth and sustainable development. The announcement that this approach will be powered by clean energy and Sabka Prayas is an encouraging news for the RE sector. The sector can leverage GatiShakti platform to make India a RE superpower, while creating huge job and entrepreneurial opportunities. The revamped government schemes - Mission Shakti, Mission Vatsalya, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 - have improved infrastructure and are powered by clean energy. Overall, this year's budget is the right step forward to achieve  Panchamrit  vision outlined by Modi during COP26 which encompasses achieving 500 GW RE by 2030 while reducing carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes and reduce carbon intensity by 45% by 2030. Finally, all measures will have to converge to ensure India becomes Net Zero by 2070.",

        "articleBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will virtually address the renewable energy players on Friday to discuss the initiatives of the government in the energy and resources sector including Budget 2022 announcements and to elicit ideas for their implementation.A sectoral group on resources comprising the ministries of power; petroleum and natural gas; new and renewable energy; coal; mines; external affairs; and environment forest and climate change is organising a Webinar on \u201cEnergy for Sustainable Growth\u201d. The Webinar will have three different sessions. The plenary session would be addressed by Prime Minister, an official statement said. This session will be followed by six thematic breakout sessions which would take place parallelly The concluding session will be chaired by power and new and renewable energy minister R K Singh.The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) will be conducting the breakout session on \u201cScaling up of Renewable Energy\u201d, which will be moderated by Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi, Secretary, MNRE. The session will have two focus areas \u2013 solar manufacturing and green hydrogen. India has a target of installing about 300 GW of solar power capacity by 2030. A  National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules  was approved in 2021 to promote manufacturing of high efficiency solar PV modules, including the upstage vertical components like solar PV cells, wafers, ingots, polysilicon. Nearly 9 GW capacity of fully integrated solar PV module manufacturing units for Rs 4,500 crore of initial allocation has been awarded. An additional outlay of Rs 19,500 crore was announced in the Budget 2022-23to set up about 40GW of solar module manufacturing capacity.In the Independence Day address Modi announced the National Green Hydrogen Mission and stated the goal to make India the global hub of Green Hydrogen production and export. The proposed National Hydrogen Mission accordingly seeks to evolve a framework for demand creation, support for indigenous manufacturing, research and development, pilot projects in emerging areas, and an enabling ecosystem of policies, regulations and standards. The proposed measures are expected to scale up production, use and export of Green Hydrogen and its derivatives, the statement said.",

        "articleBody": "A debate has emerged in the government over explicitly committing to the 500GW renewable energy target and plans for reduction of one billion tonnes of cumulative emissions by 2030 in the soon to be updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) or climate targets.The Ministries of Power and New and Renewable Energy among others are learnt to have cautioned against mentioning both commitments in the updated NDCs, ET has learnt.The reason: India could lose flexibility on its climate goals if it binds itself in absolute global commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) even as electricity demand remains dynamic and carbon capture technologies are yet to be realised fully on a large scale basis.ET has learnt that the issue has formally come up in recent inter-ministerial discussions on updating of India's NDCs.The government will soon be taking a proposal to the Union Cabinet on updating of India's NDCs, an exercise expected to be completed well in time for the December COP-27 meet in Egypt.Every country is expected to submit its post 2020 climate targets or NDCs towards achievement of the Paris Agreement. While India is set to overachieve on its 2015 NDCs, it is yet to submit its new and updated NDCs for 2030.However, a template was set at the COP-26 Glasgow talks in October 2021 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Apart from announcing India's commitment to a 2070 net zero target, the PM said that by 2030 India would ensure that 50% of its electric power installed will be through non fossil fuel sources besides achieving 500GW of non fossil fuel electric power.The Ministry of Power and MNRE have now argued that while the PM's announcement must be respected and adhered to as a domestic target for the country, there was no need or compulsion to include it as NDC targets.They are learnt to reason that an NDC assuring 500GW commitment, while it will automatically cover the 50% target, will also bind India to the absolute target even if overall demand for electricity in the country does not grow commensurately by 2030.That apart, a 500GW NDC target will also prevent any new renewable energy project to be counted towards international carbon markets as Article 6 of the Paris Agreement only counts projects outside of NDCs. However, to achieve the 500GW RE target, practically every RE project will need to be included.The second proposal being cautioned about is regarding the announcement of achieving a one-billion-tonne reduction in India's cumulative emissions from 2021 to 2030.India's carbon dioxide emissions stand at about 2.8 giga tonnes (GT) currently and are projected to touch 4.48 GT by 2030 as per projections made by the environmental think tank Centre for Science & Environment. To shave off one billion tonnes will require massive decarbonisation drives and mandates for clean fuel switch even as technologies for such large scale switch are untested so far.Stakeholder ministries have red flagged that such an absolute commitment in NDCs will invite intense global scrutiny of these targets even as the country is at a crucial stage of development which will involve some increase in Green House Gas emissions.India's announcement to reduce emission intensity of the country's GDP by 45% by 2030 as compared to 2005 level, however, will be able to accommodate any such ambition if achieved and hence the nation's commitment to the cause will be clear as well, it is argued.

An interactive meet on \u201copportunities of solar power plants in tea estates and tea factories\u201d was organised under the aegis of tea producer associations \u2013 ABITA, ATPA, BCP and NETA at the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre (GTAC).The Managing Director of APDCL, Rakesh Kumar, was present and addressed the gathering and urged the tea industry representatives to give suggestions on the \u2018Draft Assam Renewable Energy Policy, 2022\u2019. He appreciated the interactive meet and said interactions with tea industry will continue. The New and Renewable Energy (NRE) wing of APDCL, during their presentation elaborated on several modes of execution of solar projects in the tea industry \u2013 rooftop solar power plant on CAPEX or RESCO mode, setting up of solar power plant by leasing out uncultivated barren tea land, captive solar power plant and setting up solar parks by way of leasing out land to APDCL. Already APDCL has issued vendor registration to 15 tea estates for installation of Rooftop Solar Power Plants. Several solar companies have given their presentations \u2013 Tata Power, KSL (official channel partner of Adani Power), Roofsol, Firstgreen and AVCO. Also, financial institutions SIDBI and PNB informed about their financing schemes for solar. \u201cSolar projects can be a game changer for the tea industry. We can use barren uncultivated land for solar power projects which could generate revenue to tea companies. We also have factory roof for installation of solar panels. But tea industry is seasonal in nature and therefore power consumption is not same throughout the year. There are some more issues and therefore we will seek Government\u2019s guidance on how to tackle those issues so that it results in a win-win situation for the tea industry and the State.\u201d, said Bidyananda Barkakoty, Adviser, North Eastern Tea Association (NETA).

        "articleBody": "India's largest oil firm IOC will set up 'green hydrogen' plants at its Mathura and Panipat refineries by 2024 to replace carbon-emitting units as it sees the just announced green hydrogen policy as a watershed moment in the country's energy transition that will help cut costs. SSV Ramakumar, Director for Research and Development at Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), says the new policy will help cut the cost of manufacturing green hydrogen by 40-50 per cent.   This (policy) is the single biggest enabler by the state for production of green hydrogen,  he told PTI here.  Oil refineries, fertiliser plants and steel units use hydrogen as process fuel to produce finished products.  In refineries, hydrogen is used to remove excess sulphur from petrol and diesel. This hydrogen presently is produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas or naphtha and results in carbon emissions.  IOC plans to replace this 'grey hydrogen' with 'green hydrogen' -- also referred to as 'clean hydrogen' -- by using electricity from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to split water into two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom through a process called electrolysis.   The headline cost of renewable electricity at Rs 2 per kWh (or per unit) is actually the price at the generation site (say solar farm in Rajasthan or Ladakh). This becomes Rs 4 to 7 per unit after adding different levies during its transit through transmission lines in different states,  he said.  At a factory-gate cost of Rs 4 to 7 per unit, green hydrogen production costs come to Rs 500 per kg. This cost compares with the current grey hydrogen cost of Rs 150 per kg.  Under the green hydrogen policy announced on February 17, the renewable energy used for green hydrogen production will get open access without central surcharge and zero inter-state transmission charges for 25 years for projects commissioned before June 30, 2025.   This will essentially bring the cost of green hydrogen production down by 40 to 50 per cent,  he said.  The cost will go down further if electrolyzers, used to split water into two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, are indigenously manufactured instead of the present practice of importing them, he pointed out.  IOC plans to set up a 40 MW electrolyzer at Mathura refinery and a 15 MW unit at Panipat unit in Haryana, he said, adding the firm is targeting to produce 70,000 tonnes a year of green hydrogen by 2030, accounting for 10 per cent of its overall consumption by that time.  Across all refineries, the current hydrogen demand is about 1.4 million tonnes, which is projected to rise to 2.6 million tonnes by 2030. He said IOC is also exploring manufacturing of electrolyzers or outsourcing the production of green hydrogen.  India is targeting 15 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer-making capacity and is considering production-linked incentives to encourage local manufacturing.  Ramakumar said the current cost estimates are based on alkaline water electrolysis, which consumes some 55 units to produce 1 kg of hydrogen.  The use of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis would bring down the requirement of electricity by 10 units, thus further reducing cost.  The government on February 17 announced the first stage of policies to encourage green hydrogen/ ammonia development in the country, with plans to reach 5 million tonnes per annum of output by 2030.  The plan has significant flexibility and incentives for hydrogen producers in terms of sourcing/ development of renewable electricity -- a key to green hydrogen and ammonia production.  It gives liberty to purchase or set up renewable capacity for green hydrogen anywhere by manufacturers themselves or with a developer. It also provides for giving open access approval to transmission systems within 15 days without central surcharge and zero inter-state transmission charges for 25 years for projects commissioned before June 30, 2025.   We believe this to be an important first step to enable a hydrogen ecosystem,  he said.  Making the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy single point for all permissions and approvals cut to make it simpler to operate.   The policy is a watershed moment in India's energy transition, he added.",

        "articleBody": "The finance minister's announcement of setting up of four coal gasification plants by Coal India Ltd marks the maturing of the country's coal sector and announces its readiness for a clean energy future. Gasification allows the value of our coal resources to be unleashed in a non-combustible means, thereby averting emission of toxic gases otherwise embedded in coal at the point of combustion. These projects will produce products like methanol, DME, ammonia and ammonium nitrate that are building blocks for the energy and chemical industries. With a bold energy transition towards renewables already underway in electricity sector, our vast coal resources can now be diverted to non-combustion industrial uses, gasification being a prominent one. The adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies with gasification would help deploy India's vast coal resources without causing air pollution. This earns it the terminology of 'clean coal technology'. Two years back, CIL included gasification as a major component of its diversification agenda, others being solar manufacturing and aluminum. Since then, it has already sought bids under BOO for three gasification projects, while two more are on the anvil, adding up to use of 10 million tonnes of coal per annum. The envisaged gasification products can be used as fuel and feedstock in downstream industries. The related ministries have already announced standards of blending methanol and DME in petrol and LPG, respectively, which will promote demand for these products. The other two products, ammonia and ammonium nitrate are vital ingredients for urea and explosive manufacture, respectively, and are presently being imported to meet domestic demand.One question arises. India has been a coal importer for long, and whether there will be sufficient coal available for gasification after meeting the requirements of the domestic power and industrial sectors. It is noteworthy that a large number of captive coal blocks have now come into production, and CIL has also embarked upon a plan to raise production from 600 mt last year to 1 bt by 2024. The captive coal blocks are likely to produce nearly 200 mt every year in the next 2-3 years. Hence, domestic thermal coal availability will exceed demand in the next few years. In 2020, the government made the coal block regime even more attractive by permitting sale of coal by captive coal block owners, after meeting their own requirement. This has resulted in an enthusiastic response from the mining industry. All put together, from a position of large coal imports, in the next few years there may even be surplus for exports. Coal gasification brings several benefits. India is highly import dependent for petro-chemicals and natural gas. The products envisaged in these new projects will provide feedstock for a new industrial economy and promote 'atmanirbharta'. As of now, petrochemicals and gas-related downstream industries are largely dependent on imported feedstock. The import-based LNG terminals located in western India supply imported gas to projects in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Kerala. The new coal-gasification based industries in eastern and central India could be a game-changer, spurring new plants in these sectors and in different regions. The four projects are planned in close proximity of coalfields in West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Maharashtra. These were traditional industrial areas of the country, and with the pivot of manufacturing shifting elsewhere, they have for some decades now lagged for want of investments in large industries.There will be a challenge of accessing technology for gasification. Many technology providers are not even coal mining companies, and may not be interested in coal mining for supply of coal to these plants. CIL has rightly offered to derisk them by providing coal and also guaranteeing purchase of their output. Each of these projects is expected to consume nearly 1.5 mt of coal per annum, and might lay the foundation for a near $ 50 billion investment, for gasification of 100 mt of coal annually by 2030.(The writer is coal secretary, India)",

        "articleBody": "Renewable energy capacity addition increased 80 per cent to 3.4 gigawatts (GW) during the December 2021 quarter compared to a year ago, according to CEEW-CEF. New capacity addition of non-hydro renewable energy increased to 3.4 GW during the third quarter of FY22, compared to just 1.9 GW installed in the same period last year (October-December 2020), according to the latest edition of the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) Market Handbook, according to a statement.  This is nearly an 80 per cent jump in new renewable energy (RE) capacity addition on a year-on-year basis.  However, it stated that compared to the preceding quarter (July-September), new non-hydro RE capacity additions fell 27 per cent on account of intensifying supply chain constraints.  Solar energy comprised 92 per cent of the total RE capacity added during the quarter, driven partly by a 142 per cent rise in installations of rooftop solar to 700 megawatts (MW). This growth in new capacity was registered despite a 40 per cent jump in the prices of solar PV modules to Rs 21 per watt-peak, over the last year, it stated.  An increase in the cost of raw materials and supply chain constraints resulted in rising solar PV module costs, it stated.  Overall, in terms of net capacity additions, renewable energy formed 75 per cent of the total 4.5 GW capacities added (net of 900 MW, which were converted to captive mode) in the power sector during the period, it stated.  During the quarter, coal-based power generation capacities of 2,095 MW were added in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Bihar, it said.  The handbook showed that sales of electric vehicles jumped by over 250 per cent to over 1.3 lakh during the Q3 FY22, compared with around 34,000 units in the third quarter of last fiscal.  The surge in petrol prices, the introduction of new models along with incentives under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid vehicle (FAME-II) scheme contributed to the growth in sales of zero-emission vehicles, especially electric two-wheelers.",

        "articleBody": "Reiterating its push for industries to switch to cleaner fuels, the Centre-appointed air quality panel on Wednesday directed industries operating in the NCR areas of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to switch to piped natural gas (PNG) or biomass fuel. In its official order, the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) observed that despite the availability of natural gas infrastructure, industries located in NCR of Haryana, UP and Rajasthan have still not shifted to PNG or cleaner fuels.  It directed them to switch to PNG or biomass fuel by September 30 or face shut down.   Non-switchover shall result in closure of industries using other fuels,  the panel said.  It also said that till such time the transition to fuels is affected, such industries shall use only fuels as approved by the respective state governments for industrial operations.  The commission said that industries in the jurisdiction of GNCTD have already been shifted to cleaner fuel, mainly PNG. This decision of the commission has been taken after soliciting views from different organisations, associations, entities and state governments.   A large number of associations, federations and individuals submitted before the commission their requests for permitting use of biomass fuels in addition to PNG, citing that biomass-based fuels are much more environment friendly than fossil fuels like HSD and coal, etc in terms of carbon emissions,  it said.  The emissions from industries using polluting fuels create an adverse impact on air quality in the NCR and shifting of industries to PNG/cleaner fuels has always been a priority for CAQM, it said.  The panel noted that open burning of biomass is one of the major causes for air pollution in NCR and through enhanced usage of biomass as fuel in industrial operations in the NCR, the commission is primarily focused on controlling the issue of biomass burning.   This will not only help in minimising the usage of polluting fuel in NCR industries but also enhance farmers' earnings, while ensuring proper utilization of biomass.   All industries in the NCR running on coal if shifted to PNG or biomass fuels in conjunction with Air Pollution Control Devices (APCD), would result in a remarkable decline in biomass burning across different regions of NCR and adjoining areas, thereby improving the air quality,  the panel said.",

Both schemes are open for domestic as well as foreign entities.Responding to a query on Tesla, the minister said  the company wants workers from China and market of India. This is not possible in Modi government... our government's policy is that if india market is to be used, job opportunities will have to be given to Indians. The minister's reply came in response to a question by Congress member K Suresh on whether the government would invite Tesla to enter the Indian market and steps being taken to promote mass production of electric vehicles in the country. Want to ask the member if they want india's money to go to China? That company has not applied as per our policy. For that (company), doors of India are open, they can come apply as per policy, set up company, give jobs to our people, increase government revenue,  the minister said. Modiji ki sarkar mein ye nahi ho sakta ki rozgar Cheen ko aur market Bharat ki... Modiji sarkar ki neeti hai ki agar market Bharat ki hai, rozgar bhi Bharat ke logon ko milega.... (Under Modi government, it cannot happen that jobs are in China while market is India... The government's policy is that if the market is India, then peope in India should get jobs),  Gurjar said.He was responding to another member's query about the government's position on exemptions sought by Tesla and some states expressing interest to have the company's manufacturing units.Last month, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said the company is working through a lot of challenges with the government to launch its products in India.For promotion of EVs, there are schemes and the benefits are that advanced technology will come to India and parts will also be manufactured here. People will get jobs and consumers will get cheaper vehicles, the minister said.The minister also said recently a round table was organised that saw participation of representatives of several companies and associations like SIAM. All said in one voice that the government has done what it had to and that it was now time for the industries to come forward, he added.",

Both the parties have entered into a 25-year PPA, which will see the project supply power for the plant at Vilayat, Bharuch, via an Open Access mechanism, it said.Once both phases are commissioned with a combined capacity of 34.28 MW, the partnership is expected to generate a total of approximately 160 million units of renewable electricity annually, mitigating a cumulative 150,000 tCO2e (carbon emission) a year, it saidBoth phases together have a total investment of Rs 382 crore through an equity partnership. \u201cWith corporates increasingly harnessing renewable energy, ReNew aims to develop around 250 MW of wind-solar hybrid projects in Gujarat for commercial and industrial consumers, like we have just done at Vilayat, Bharuch,\u201d Mayank Bansal, Chief Commercial Officer, ReNew Power, said Gujarat notified its solar policy in 2009 and was the first state to announce a hybrid policy in 2018. It has made hybrid plants attractive for investments by corporates by providing incentives such as a waiver on electricity duty.",

The single-window facility seeks to facilitate the rapid expansion of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles at private and semi-public places like apartments, group housing societies, hospitals, malls and theatres in the city. The first private charging point was installed earlier this week at DDA Flats in south Delhi's Munirka, while the second one was installed next to it in east Delhi's Vivek Vihar, the BSES spokesperson said.  Consumers of BSES discoms BRPL and BYPL can get a private EV charging point installed through an online single-window portal (Switch Delhi) at their homes, group housing societies, multi-storey apartment complexes, RWA offices, commercial shops etc., through the empanelled vendors,  he said. Twelve vendors have been empanelled by the Transport Department for the installation of charging points. For the promotion and expansion of the private charging network, the government is providing a one-time subsidy of Rs 6,000 for the first 30,000 charging points. EV chargers can be purchased by consumers from the empanelled vendors through the single-window portal as per capex or subscription model. Under the capex model, the consumer makes the complete payment upfront to the empanelled vendor. Under the subscription model, the total cost to the vendor is paid by the consumer as equal monthly instalments over three years after which the charger gets transferred to him. The private charging infrastructure development programme aims to create an enabling environment for the provision of private as well as public charging infrastructure.",

        "articleBody": "The finance minister used the words 'green', 'clean', 'sustainable' and 'carbon-neutral' economy multiple times in her 90-minute budget speech on Tuesday, underlining the importance the government is according to sustainability and decarbonisation goals.As per the International Energy Agency, India was the third-largest polluter-nation with nearly 2.35 giga tonnes of carbon emissions in 2021, though one of the lowest on per capita basis. Further, considering India's strong developmental agenda and growth aspirations, big policy initiatives and investments are crucial to achieve 'net-zero' target.To begin with, of the nine key ministries in the infrastructure sector that account for close to 55% of the government's capital expenditure of \u20b96.5 lakh crore, allocations to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) have doubled from 2% of total allocations to the nine ministries last fiscal to a targeted 5% next fiscal.The power sector is the largest emitter of carbon - with a share of over 50% - and, thus, deservedly in focus.The budget has reiterated the government's stance of going beyond targeting investments in green infrastructure and building a viable ecosystem with scalability to contain emissions. Accordingly, allocation to the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for high-efficiency solar modules has been raised to \u20b924,000 crore from \u20b94,500 crore with a dual objective of both building in-house capability and grabbing a pie of international opportunity pie.While increase in customs duty on windmill parts and a number of capital equipment linked to green power and firming basic customs duty implementation in solar with an eye on boosting the domestic value chain may be a short-term negative, over the long-term, ecosystem development clearly remains the agenda.The push for a circular economy (the manufacturing to recycling chain) and expanded producer responsibility for 10 sectors, including auto, e-waste, infrastructure, and logistics, and facilitating 'sustainability-as-service', will provide opportunities for sustainability startups and ultimately help reduce India's carbon footprint.Another area of focus is transportation, second only to power with a share of over 13% in emissions, of which nearly 80% is via road transportation. Most modellers believe this segment will see a sharp rise in emissions over the next 20 years as the Indian middle class buys under-penetrated products such as cars and utility vehicles, and experiences enhanced travel needs amid rising per capita income. That re-emphasises the importance of zero-fossil-fuel policies.For electric vehicles, enabling the evolution of a better ecosystem, mitigating range-anxiety, and setting battery swapping standards will promote battery-as-a-service business models.Policies linked to ethanol blending are yet another way of reiterating the importance of efficient usage of fossil fuels. Though the percentage of volumes attracting higher excise under unblended fuel will be less than 5%, the move does underline the government is keen on transition to a net-zero economy by 2070.That being said, improving efficiency is as much a part of the decarbonisation agenda. The government has tried to build capacity focusing on efficiency under PM Gati Shakti and has spoken of specific commitments to develop milestones to improve logistical efficiency, where India ranks at 45, below competitors such as China at 26 or Vietnam at 39.Awarding four multimodal logistic parks, 100 cargo terminals in three years, and building metros and mass-commute infrastructure between railways and metros also underline the focus on cost efficiency and fuel savings alike.The first steps towards sovereign green bonds for funding green infrastructure capex also bear watching. With this India will join the ranks of 19 nations that have so far issued similar bonds.Additionally, under Parivesh, the government has touched upon the need for quick environmental clearances and land availability to spur capacity additions in the green world.Overall, much has been addressed, and a lot remains to be done.The hydrogen policy to be released in a week will be crucial to initiate an ecosystem to reduce emissions in the five largest polluting sectors of India on the industrial side - refining, chemicals, steel, cement and fertilisers.Given the vast reserves of coal, and the environmental benefits and wider applications for energy usages associated with coal gasification, setting up pilot projects for coal gasification and demonstrating its technical and financial feasibility will boost private sector confidence in the segment.The government can further earmark high-quality coal blocks for more of such projects and incentivise technology usage through waiver of various cess and levies that are currently applicable for mining coal.Incentives to drive viability will also be needed. We have to navigate swiftly between optimisation, transition and deep decarbonisation. Given the green agenda, the investment cycle triggered by PLI could extend to an investment supercycle. The fact that nearly 40% of PLI investments are linked to green ecosystem sets a good augury.The writer is MD, Crisil",

Since Green Banks have emerged as an innovative tool for accelerating clean energy financing globally, the Government should explore setting up of a green bank system which can address the persisting finance related challenges being faced by the renewable energy sector in the country,  the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy said in its 21st report tabled in Parliament on Thursday.  Keeping in view that the overall debt requirement is large and reducing the cost of financing to the renewable energy developers is important, it also suggested that the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) may explore the possibility of prescribing Renewable Finance Obligation on the lines of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for banks and financial institutions.  The Renewable Finance Obligation will make them invest a specific percentage of their investment in the renewable energy sector.  It also suggested that the ministry should work proactively to make available and explore innovative financing mechanisms and alternative funding avenues like Infrastructure Development Fund (IDF), Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InVITs), Alternate Investment Funds, Green/Masala Bonds, crowdfunding etc for the renewable energy sector.  It noted that under India's long term commitments, an additional investment of about Rs 17 lakh crore has been envisaged, which would include associated transmission costs. The country would need an annual investment of Rs 1.5 - 2 lakh crore in renewable energy sector, against which the estimated investment for the last few years have been in the range of Rs 75,000 crore only.  The panel said it will be a gargantuan task to fill this gap which requires an enabling framework to be created by the government.  It also suggested that IREDA (Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency) should be given a special window for borrowing from the RBI at repo rate in line with other specialised financial institutions like NHB, SIDBI and NABARD to ensure availability of low-cost financial resources for the renewable energy sector.  The panel recommended that the MNRE should explore the possibility of exempting PFC, REC and IREDA from payment of guarantee fee for raising funds from international multilateral agencies like KfW, JICA and ADB.  Alternatively, guarantee fee should be charged at a concessional rate, like in the case of the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development.  Besides, it suggested that the ministry should pursue the banks which provide funds to renewable energy sector to restructure the loans in such a way that the EMI is kept higher in peak season of revenue generation and lower in the off-season.  The committee also recommend that the ministry should actively engage with the state governments to avoid any unilateral cancellation/renegotiation of PPAs (power purchase agreements) as it causes uncertainty and negatively affects the investment in the renewable energy sector.  It also suggested that a maximum period should be prescribed for according approvals/disposing of petitions by the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions through appropriate amendments in the Electricity Act.  It recommended that the ministry should ensure proper implementation of the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge) Rules, 2021 so that the developers get compensated for delays caused by discoms in payment of dues.  The ministry should also ensure that every PPA signed by renewable energy developers with discoms has a provision of payment security instrument and the same is implemented in letter and spirit.  It stated that the ministry should pursue the states/discoms to clear dues on 'first in - first out' basis so that the oldest dues are paid first.  The panel also stated that MNRE should pursue the matter of banks' reluctance to lend with the local banks and ensure availability of funds for installation of renewable power capacity under schemes like rooftop solar and KUSUM.  The limit of loans for the renewable energy sector under priority sector lending should be increased and the MNRE should pursue this matter with the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India, it suggested.",

        "articleBody": "In the transition from conventional fossil fuel-based power generation to an alternative resource-based energy portfolio, nuclear energy plays a significant role to help economies achieving zero carbon footprint targets while reducing socio-economic poverty including offering alternatives to existing jobs. India has been actively pursuing an ambitious growth trajectory in alternative source-based energy generation with the aim to significantly reduce its total carbon emissions. At the recently held 26th meeting of the Conference of Parties on climate change in Glasgow, the Prime Minister of India made a set of five declarations - \u2018Panchamrit\u2019 towards realising this goal. One of these was to increase production of nuclear power three times more than the current levels by 2031, thus reducing our reliance on carbon-emitting thermal power.Challenges and Concerns Among the first challenge of nuclear power generation is accidents leading to harm to humans and the ecology. Nuclear power is often projected as a cheap and environmentally benign source of energy generation. But the chances of accidents in nuclear power plants leading to radiation harm in absence of adequate precautionary measures and redressal mechanisms are moderately high. Thus, we need to ensure higher standards of safety by drawing lessons from nuclear disasters like Fukushima, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island etc. The second challenge is raw materials such as uranium etc. The discovery of a uranium mine in Andhra Pradesh along with the country\u2019s economically extractable thorium base could partly address India\u2019s raw material crisis for generating nuclear energy. Other than that we have also tied up with uranium producers like Australia to supply in compliance with the norms of Nuclear Suppliers Group. Nevertheless, supply and procurement of other components should not be ignored while championing nuclear energy.  Another area of growing concern is nuclear waste produced at different stages of energy generation. However, not all nuclear wastes are hazardous or difficult to treat. Concerted efforts to prepare a structured plan for effective management of these radioactive wastes should involve characterisation, segregation, handling, treatment, conditioning and monitoring. Assessment of Costs and BenefitsCosts and benefits of nuclear power generation are at times assessed without incorporating the social, economic and environmental concerns of local people and ecology. Local communities often do not get an opportunity to let their views known to the authorities. This is in spite of the positive impact of the investment in the local economy by creating jobs. In the absence of a definite community engagement plan and cross-sectional dialogue coupled with chronic resource limitations, it becomes difficult to accept nuclear energy as a significant contributor to the overall energy portfolio of India.  The movement against the nuclear power plant in Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu and protests against the Jaitapur nuclear power plant in Maharashtra have been two significant people\u2019s resistance movements. Similarly, another nuclear proposal in Haripur, West Bengal faced severe backlash from local residents, environmentalists and the opposition political parties. However, whether the driving force behind such outcomes was local, political or vested interests, should be carefully examined. Nuclear Energy and a Just TransitionHowever, it is well established that nuclear energy, regarded as the second largest source of low carbon intensive electricity production, offers multiple advantages facilitating the much-envisaged energy transition. Nuclear power has an inbuilt flexibility to address fluctuations in energy demand and supply matrix at an affordable cost, which is crucial to maintain grid stability especially in areas with a huge reliance on intermittent renewable energy generation. Further, with operational upgradations, nuclear plants can produce hydrogen and help decarbonising other sectors of the economy. However, to facilitate a \u2018Just\u2019 energy transition, it is equally important look beyond techno-economic parameters and consider the stake of local people before designing such projects.  A Possible RoadmapWhile nuclear energy continues to be a tangible expression of a nation\u2019s prestige and power, it can certainly help negating socio-economic poverty, especially in this pandemic-induced world. Following points are important to note in this regard:Safety, cost and efficiency are to be kept in mind while drafting action plans for nuclear energy promotion, with the local community and environment occupying a central position in the process. Emphasis should be on building societal awareness and decoding the negative connotations around nuclear power generation with scientific know-how.Securely deploying and maintaining an ecosystem to take care of nuclear waste without causing any damage to environment or human habitat is of immense importance. A monitoring system to assess the safety requirements and compliances should be in place.There should be an optimal regulatory regime to ensure safety standards are not flouted by anyone.The incentives offered to different sections of stakeholder should not be conflicting in nature.Nuclear energy is neither an endless nor a renewable resource as uranium reserves will start dwindling after a certain time. Therefore, phase-wise utilisation as well as maintaining a scientific energy consumption pattern are crucial for this resource to be sustained over a significant timeframe. Building a nuclear power plant is an expensive affair. People\u2019s first public-private partnership should be promoted with necessary policy support, free flow of authentic information and careful impact assessment on diverse stakeholders.Mehta is Secretary General and Bhattacharjee is Policy Analyst, CUTS International, a global public policy think- and action-tank on trade, regulation and governance.",

        "articleBody": "The government has shown single-minded focus in creating wealth and ensuring welfare for its citizens, and this year's Union Budget is a solid step forward in fulfilling its long-term vision for the country.The honourable finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has presented a pro-reforms and progressive budget, setting the tone for faster growth on the journey to become a $5-trillion economy as well as laying out the blueprint for the next 25 years for India@100.One of the significant announcements of this budget is the battery swapping policy - potentially a game-changer in catalysing the migration to Electric Vehicles (EVs). While the scale of its impact will be clear upon formation of the policy, the industry is committed to sharing its insights and expertise with the government to make this a reality. I am personally delighted with this move by the government as it resonates with our company's and my own commitment to the cause of sustainability.The renewed focus on sustainability through natural and organic farming, PLI on green energy and the creation of funds will go a long way in helping India's efforts to meet climate-change goals for a sustainable future. The continued emphasis on infrastructure will not only improve the quality of lives and generate jobs but will also help Indian industry become globally competitive. The increase in capex spends will have a cascading effect on private investments and structural growth across sectors. The initiative to give interest-free loans to states to the tune of \u20b91 lakh crore for infrastructural investments will further boost key projects with potential for long-term dividends. The impact of continued focus on infra and logistics through the PM Gati Shakti plan will also extend to other sectors and benefit all industries.Built around the pillars of development - the PM Gati-Shakti plan for infrastructure, inclusive development & productivity enhancement, energy transition & climate action, and financing of investments - this year's Budget addresses the needs of every sector and segment of the society. Be it the allocation to provide affordable homes under the PM Awaas Yojana or the deployment of core banking system across 1.5 lakh post offices in the country, the budgetary provisions strongly reflect the government's resolve to usher in inclusive growth that benefits every citizen in every part of the country.Overall, this is a development-focused budget with a clear long-term vision to bring about sustainable growth.",

        "articleBody": "Union Power Minister R K Singh said the Budget 2022-23 has everything that is required for energy transition, including a provision for additional Rs 19,500 crore to boost domestic solar equipment manufacturing by up to 45 gigawatts (GW). In the Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman provided additional Rs 19,500 crore for the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for solar cells and modules manufacturing domestically.  This will raise the existing PLI scheme for solar equipment from Rs 4,500 crore to Rs 24,000 crore, which will translate into creating an additional manufacturing capacity of up to 45 GW in the country.   Whatever was required for energy transition has been provided in this Budget (presented on Tuesday). We have a challenge of energy transition before us. The energy transition is necessary to deal with climate change,  the minister said.  He added that the government has to move towards lower energy sources which cause either lower emissions or none at all.   We need to do two things. First, we need to produce solar equipment here (in India) which is imported. The government has provided additional Rs 19,500 crore for PLI for solar manufacturing,  Singh said.  He also stated that PLI is a big scheme and helps to create a production capacity of 40 GW to 45 GW of solar equipment here in India, which ranges from polysilicon to modules.  In her Budget Speech, Sitharaman said that to facilitate domestic manufacturing for the ambitious goal of 280-GW installed solar capacity by 2030, an additional allocation of Rs 19,500 crore for the PLI scheme will be made.  In April 2021, the Union Cabinet approved a Rs 4,500-crore PLI scheme to boost the domestic manufacturing capacity of solar PV modules.  When the scheme was approved in April 2021, it was aimed at adding a 10,000-megawatt (MW) manufacturing capacity of integrated solar PV modules, entailing a direct investment of Rs 17,200 crore at present.  About raising import duty on solar modules from 20 per cent to 40 per cent, Singh stated that  we will use made-in-India solar modules and, therefore, 40 per cent customs duty will be imposed from April 1, 2022 .  The Budget document has also proposed to raise import duty on solar cells to 25 per cent from 20 per cent from April 1, 2022.  The minister also said,  (The) government has also provided for green bonds for investment in clean energy projects like green hydrogen .  Sitharaman also proposed that as part of the government's overall market borrowings in 2022-23, sovereign green bonds will be issued for mobilising resources for green infrastructure.  The proceeds will be deployed in public sector projects, which helps in reducing the carbon intensity of the economy.  She also talked about co-firing five to seven per cent biomass pellets in thermal power plants, resulting in CO2 savings of 38 MMT (million metric tonnes) annually.  Regarding giving the infrastructure status to battery energy storage systems, Singh stated that this will improve the credit facility for big projects.  The Budget has proposed that energy storage systems, including dense charging infrastructure and grid-scale battery systems, will be included in the harmonised list of infrastructure. This will facilitate credit availability for clean energy storage.  Singh said the government will also bring out a battery-swapping policy and make green mobility zones.  He added that there could be such zones in overcrowded areas like Connaught Place or Sarojini Nagar.  The minister also lauded the provision of blending of biomass pellets with fuel in thermal power plants.  Jakson Solar Chief Operating Officer Anurag Garg said,  An additional allocation of Rs 19,500 crore for PLI for the manufacturing of high-efficiency modules with a priority to fully integrate manufacturing units from polysilicon to solar PV modules is a welcome move for the sector.   He added that it will give further impetus to investments in India, generate more employment and pave the way for an Atmanirbhar Bharat.",

        "articleBody": "In an effort to boost EV adoption and facilitate clean energy transition, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced a slew of measures focusing on the growth of green energy, electric mobility, data centres, grid-connected energy storage and supporting incentives for green bonds.In her Budget Speech, Sitharaman said that the government will bring a battery-swapping policy to boost the use of EVs in the country and interoperability standards will be formulated.She also made several solar sector-related announcements, including Rs 19,500-crore additional allocation under the PLI scheme, for manufacturing high-efficiency solar modules.Here's what experts have to say about Sitharaman's electric vehicle and renewable energy push in Modi 2.0's fourth Budget.Kelkar, Director, Climate Programme, WRI IndiaBy referring to climate action as a sunrise sector and employment generator, Budget 2022 has sent an important signal to markets, financial institutions and the workforce. We now need the power of government incentives, aggregation and de-risking for clean energy to be complemented by standards for low-carbon materials, skilling for battery recycling, and consultative processes for green infrastructure projects.Biomass pellets, energy efficient buildings, coal gasification and agroforestry are just the start of the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. The upcoming green hydrogen mission and circular economy action plans can initiate a deep shift towards industrial decarbonization.Gagan Sidhu, Director, CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF)The budget proposal to issue sovereign green bonds has several benefits, principal among which is signalling the country's seriousness in pursuing climate action. India will now join a select group of countries, primarily European, which have issued such bonds. We can also expect this move to catalyse the development of the domestic corporate green bond market. Green bond issuances by Indian companies in the overseas debt capital markets have considerably lagged so far. If sovereign green bonds price at lower yields versus their non-green counterparts, it will also provide an added signal for the private sector to direct their own capital towards green investments. This important move also ties in with the capital expenditure push \u2013 a key feature of this budget \u2013 and cuts across two of the four pillars that the Finance Minister highlighted in the budget speech: Energy Transition and Climate Action, and Financing of Investments.Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist, Lead India, IEEFAWhile jargon terms such as Energy Transition, Climate Finance, Inclusive Growth etc. were mentioned multiple times in the budget speech today, the announcements look to have fallen short of promoting clean energy in an accelerated manner.At a macro level, increase in Capex will boost economic growth, however, not much additional budgetary support or tax incentives have been provided to clean energy both grid and off-grid including solar rooftop, storage technologies and green hydrogen. This is despite the big expectation that support will be provided to these new technologies to improve its commercial viability.The increase of Rs19500 crore under the PLI scheme for high efficiency modules and the inclusion of a #zerofossilfuel policy, #EVpolicy, #batteryswapping and #coalgasification policy is a step in the right direction.The Budget emphasised that private capital will play a pivotal role. Further, the launching of sovereign green bonds will help reduce the carbon intensity of the economy and will enable access to a large pool of money for the energy transition. India has set up a huge target of 500GW of non fossil fuel energy by 2030. While renewable energy is competitive, the new technologies will require support. The Government should have provided a budget allocation and reduction of duties to allow the deployment of rooftop solar, storage, off-shore wind, green hydrogen etc. Further, the Budget didn\u2019t include any mention of support for the closure of inefficient fossil fuel plants, nor did it deal with increasing air pollution problems.Prof S N Tripathi, Civil Engineering department, Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme, MoEFCCBy fundamentally focusing on clean and sustainable development, the budget has focused on three major sectors: transport, energy and agriculture with an aim to reduce both reductions in CO2 and air pollution emissions which augur well for clean air programs in the short term and achieving Carbon neutrality in the long term.Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate TrendsIt was perhaps the first Union Budget to acknowledge climate action in it\u2019s opening statement. The budget seemed to acknowledge clean energy transition as a fundamental principle- there was mention of clean tech solutions, battery swapping policies, improving EV efficiency, finalising the 19500 cr PLI scheme for solar as a way to move ahead on low Carbon strategy.All of this needs to be placed properly in policy and regulation. The FM also mentioned explicitly that climate risk is among the strongest negative externalities. So far this has been a strong acknowledgement and case for climate action. Devil lies in details and the industry will be hoping for more policy and investment details to see if the private sector is meant to take the lead in energy transition.The mention of green bonds as part of overall market borrowings is a good step to raise funds for projects ear marked as green infrastructure. Proceeds will be deployed in public sector projects which also reduce emissions. Energy storage systems as the one critical technology which needs innovation, finance and regulation got attention in the budget. The FM announced that storage will be included in the harmonised list of infrastructure thereby makingsure that credit can be facilitated. This should mean cheaper finance for battery manufacturing. When details of this policy are announced, it will offer confidence to regulators across the country to make the much needed shift away from coal power to renewable energy- as storage meets baseload needs, and also electric vehicles.Madhav Pai, Executive Director, WRI India Ross CenterThere is a need to create a pipeline of bankable projects that can be funded by green bonds. This is a great opportunity for MoHUA to set up a project preparation facility around topics of water, sewerage, storm water, sanitation and transport.Chirag Gajjar, Head, Subnational Climate Action, Climate Program, WRI IndiaAccess to green bonds will enable local governments to cost-effectively finance basic public infrastructure projects that will lead to climate co-benefits. Focus must be on building capacity of local governments to access such finance avenues. Climate FinancePoonam Sandhu, Financial Sector Specialist, NRDC IndiaWelcome budget announcements include the intention to issue sovereign Green Bonds to finance green infrastructure, recognition of the importance of blended finance, whereby public capital investments will be channeled to help crowd in private investments, especially in sunrise sectors and the thrust on digitizing the economy including launching a national digital currency. These measures will help enhance greater capital flows in the clean energy sector and improve overall efficiencies in financing. Mobility, EV, Energy TransitionChirag Gajjar, Head, Subnational Climate Action, Climate Program, WRI India Announcement of PM Gati Shakti master plan is a step in the direction toward a cleaner transport sector. As the transport demand for passengers and freight movement is likely to double over this decade, the \u2018seven engines\u2019 of the master plan can enable integration of multi-modes leading to reduced emissions.Nitish Arora, Lead - Electric Mobility and Clean Energy, NRDC Clean energy powered electric transportation remains critical for meeting India's climate targets. Union budget 2022 makes a big push towards mainstreaming electric mobility by providing for battery swapping policy, special mobility zones for EVs, augmenting charging infrastructure, ratifying building bye laws, clean tech in public transport and much more. Indeed, it marks a drive in the right direction.Rishabh Jain, Programme Lead, CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF)Limited charging infrastructure has been a key challenge to scale up electric mobility. The announcement on battery swapping and interoperability in the Budget could lead to increased user confidence and encourage many to buy electric vehicles. Following the policy, vehicle manufacturers would need to work collectively and launch models with interoperable batteries across their products.Additionally, the government has included charging stations and battery storage as part of the harmonised list of infrastructure that will facilitate credit availability. Active involvement and training of personnel from local urban bodies, discoms and financial institutions on setting up EV charging infrastructure will be critical. Startups and established players could explore the possibility of \u2018Battery/Energy as a Service' business model to scale up their effort of setting up battery swapping or charging infrastructure.Abhishek Jain, Fellow and Director - Powering Livelihoods, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) The support for natural farming, and broadly sustainable agriculture, is a welcome move. While the thrust is going to be around the river Ganga, the government must also focus on the rain fed areas in particular. These areas are home to 50% of Indian farmers and they primarily stand to gain by shifting to natural farming. The government should consider an automatic enrolment of farmers practising Natural Farming into the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana to provide a safety net and encourage more farmers to transition to sustainable agriculture. Dr Anjal Prakash, Research Director and adjunct associate professor at the Bharti Institute of Public PolicyFor climate action, this budget fairs quite well. The focus on sustainable urban planning and mass transport is a welcome step. It is estimated that half of Indians will be living in urban areas by 2050. The high-level committee of urban planners, economists and setting up institutions for capacity building is a welcome step. I hope that the planners will recommend urban infrastructure to be climate-resilient as many Indian cities are prone to climate-related risks and disasters.Announcing a climate action fund is a welcome step where the government\u2019s share maximum of 20% and the rest is by the private parties. The Green Bonds for mobilising green infrastructure will be used for projects that will help reduce India\u2019s carbon intensity. The allocation for renewable energy and energy storage technologies such as solar modules are another area that needs applause.The major miss is focusing on the river linking project and budget allocations. Each river originates and flows in particular ecological conditions. Rather than helping to fix the ecological balance of the watershed where the river starts and flows, the focus is on the linking of rivers. This would be an environmental disaster and not a piece of good news for climate action. The second miss is in creating institutions for net-zero delivery in India. Presently no single ministry can deliver Modi\u2019s panchamrit \u2013 the five nectar elements announced at COP 26 last year. Climate scientists have been demanding that there should be a separate ministry of climate change which will give the impetus needed to PM pledge of net zero by 2070.Rishabh Jain, Programme Lead, CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF)While India has been highly dependent on imports to meet the requirements of solar modules, the announcement of an additional INR 19,500 crores (total 24,000 crores) for high-efficiency solar module manufacturing will encourage many existing and potential manufacturers to set up integrated manufacturing in India. This PLI scheme, along with basic customs duty on solar modules and extension of concessional tax regime (15%) for manufacturing (until March 2024), could be the key catalyst for India to become a global manufacturing and R&D hub for solar modules and associated products. Further, scaling up domestic manufacturing would create new jobs, reduce forex outflow and shield India from global supply chain shocks. India has no experience in polysilicon and wafer manufacturing and limited experience in solar cell manufacturing. To leverage this opportunity, manufacturers would need to invest significantly in upskilling manpower and R&D. Institutes of higher education would also need to align their courses to match the skill requirements of the industry.Balasubramanian Viswanathan, Policy Advisor, IISDThe budget announcement made promising references to climate change and energy transition, linking it to national \u201csustainable growth\u201d. However, no major new announcements were made besides the reiteration of increased PLI allocation for solar photovoltaic manufacturing. IISD-CEEW assessment of India\u2019s energy subsidies shows that direct support to clean energy has fallen 45% since the peak of FY 2017 and now shows a stagnating trend. Further, fossil fuel subsidies are over 7 times as much as renewable energy. There is a mismatch in government support and its clean energy ambition, and we hope for increased support towards clean energy to support the energy transition. But not all is lost on this front, the plan to issue sovereign green bonds is a promising initiative. That will allow the government to unlock financial support directed to public investments which often have strong social benefits.This year's budget is also a definite shift away from the conversation of energy access, a theme we have seen repeatedly in previous budgets. Direct Benefit Transfer allocation for LPG has fallen to INR 4000 crore in 2022-23 compared to INR 23,667 crore in 2020-21. This is because LPG subsidies have not been re-introduced since their suspension during the oil price crash in FY 2021, despite prices climbing back up. This raises affordability concerns for low-income households particularly hit by Covid-19 over the last two years. Providing LPG subsidies targeted towards such households while reducing them for better-off consumers can ensure they don't create additional fiscal pressure but also prevent backsliding to using biomass for cooking.Akanksha Golchha, Lead - Energy Access, NRDC India With increased impetus on energy transition and positive developments on solar and energy storage front, the budget 2022 paves way for higher energy security and last mile availability of reliable, clean, and affordable power.  Polash Mukerjee, Lead - Air Quality & Climate Resilience As one of the four stated priorities of the Govt., significant announcements on Energy Transition and Climate Action include the use of biomass in thermal power plants, advancing electric mobility and significantly, a renewed focus on urban sustainability through the establishment of a high-level committee on urban sector policies. City and state level capacity building has also been a focus, as has building urban infrastructure in key areas. One notable missed opportunity has been a special focus on building climate resilience in our villages, towns and cities, given the spate of climate linked disasters India has seen in the past few years. Given the pandemic and a focus on respiratory health, the budget also misses specifically addressing the state of air quality in our cities. Overall, it is a step in the right direction following India's international climate commitments, but much more needs to be addressed in the fine print.  Charu Lata, Lead - Electric Mobility and Clean Energy Access, NRDC India ProgramShifting to renewable energy technologies is imperative to meet India\u2019s climate goals. India's recent international climate commitments have been bolstered by announcements in this budget, including the facilitation of indigenous manufacturing of solar panels as well as focus on skill development by aligning with industry needs and upskilling and reskilling the workforce. Jobs created in the RE market offer a significant opportunity to meet the multiple goals of employment generation, clean energy transition, and economic development.",

PARIVESH is a web-based, role-based workflow app developed for online submission and monitoring of proposals submitted by the proponents for seeking environment, forest, wildlife and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearances from central, state and district-level authorities.  It automates the entire tracking of proposals which includes online submission of a new proposal, editing/updating the details thereof and displaying status of proposal at each stage of the workflow.   A single-window portal, PARIVESH, for all green clearances was launched in 2018. It has been instrumental in reducing the time required for approvals significantly,  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said during the Budget speech.   The scope of this portal will now be expanded, to provide information to the applicants. Based on location of units, information about specific approvals will be provided,  she said.  It will enable application for all four approvals through a single form, and tracking of the process through Centralized Processing Centre-Green (CPC-Green).",

The government had conducted a similar Rs 4,500 crore solar manufacturing production linked incentive (PLI) scheme last year where Jindal India Solar Energy, Shirdi Sai Electricals, Reliance New Energy and Adani Infrastructure emerged as lowest bidders.Sitharaman in her budget speech said bio pellets co-firing will be made compulsory for thermal power projects.\u201c5-7% co-firing of bio-mass pellets will be co-fired in thermal fired plants resulting in carbon dioxide saving of 38 mmt annually. This will also provide extra income to farmers and job opportunities to locals and help avoid stubble burning in agricultural fields,\u201d Sitharaman said.She said saving energy is an important aspect of energy management hence energy efficiency and savings measures will be promoted. \u201cThis will be done in large commercial buildings through the energy service company business model. It will facilitate capacity building and awareness for energy audits.Sitharaman announced that the government would introduce a battery swapping policy for urban cities that lack space to set up charging stations for electric vehicles.",

        "articleBody": "Ahead of the upcoming Union Budget, environmental experts on Monday called for budgetary allocation under \u201cgreen expenditure\u201d to show that India is serious about meeting the enhanced targets announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Conference of the Parties 26 in Glasgow.They also said that India's climate targets will require an investment of about USD 35 million in energy storage in this decade alone.The Budget for the fiscal year commencing April 1, 2022, will be presented on Tuesday by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.\u201cThe Union Budget can be the opportunity to bring focus and direction by announcing a green expenditure head in the Budget this time.\u201cPublic expenditure allocations can intersect with a range of programmes across sectors, some of which could be tagged as \u2018green' and it will signal that the Indian government is serious about upping its game to meet the enhanced commitment announcements made by the Prime Minister in Glasgow,\u201d said Dhruba Purkayastha, India director, Climate Policy Initiative.Talking about India's ambition to increase non-fossil electricity capacity to 500 giga watt in just nine years, another expert said that budget incentives are needed to fulfil the goals.\u201cIndia's climate targets will require about USD 35 billion investment in energy storage in this decade alone. Budget incentives and risk guarantees to attract investment in battery storage will be key to ramp up non-fossil electricity generation.\u201cIndia's climate targets aim to increase non-fossil electricity capacity from 158 GW to 500 GW in just nine years. Since land is precious, we need budget incentives to realise the full potential of rooftop solar photo voltaic (system),\u201d said Ulka Kelkar, director, Climate program, World Resources Institute (WRI) India.Kelkar said that since critical mineral reserves are scarce, the budget can provide incentives for circular economy, urban mining and e-waste recycling.\u201cIt would be great to see the creation of a national transition fund for fossil fuel sector workers and MSMEs, which can also attract grants from international climate funds,\u201d she said.Another expert said that the government should focus on developing long-term climate resilience and adaptation pathways for which the Budget must set aside substantial funds.\u201cRecent cyclones like Yass, Tauktae and the 2021 Chennai floods are reminders that the government should focus on developing a long-term climate resilience and adaptation pathway for India.\u201cBudget 2022-23 must set aside substantial resources to support resilience activities at the local level, especially in augmenting nature-based solutions, building ground level capacities, and working through state and local governments,\u201d said A Nambi Appadurai, director, Climate Resilience Practice Program, WRI India.He added that such investments would have multiple and long-term benefits for India's climate commitments, the people, their livelihoods, and the country's GDP as well.Experts also called for budgetary allocation for 'green hydrogen' citing its importance in the industrial sector and in research and development to help indigenise green hydrogen production and use as an industrial fuel.\u201cGreen hydrogen has many industrial uses and can potentially decarbonise many hard-to-abate sectors, like the iron and steel industry.\u201cAn outlay of Rs 1,200 crore by 2024 in the upcoming Budget could trigger pilots in various end-use applications such as testing green hydrogen readiness of natural gas pipelines, underground hydrogen storage, and pilots for equipment such as furnaces, boilers, and process heaters,\u201d said Hemant Mallya, senior programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).Mallya also called for another Rs 165 crore to support research and development, especially on catalysts and electrolyser membranes, finding substitutes for critical minerals, setting up testing labs and enforcing safety standards.\u201cThese investments would help indigenise green hydrogen production and use it as an industrial fuel,\u201d he said.With maximum applied fertiliser leaking into the air and water, causing pollution, another expert urged the government to provide direct income support to farmers in the upcoming Budget instead of the fertiliser subsidy.\u201cOur fiscal outlay on fertiliser subsidy is touching Rs 1,55,000 crore, with more than 78 per cent of the applied fertiliser leaking into our air and water, causing pollution. Instead, the government should consider providing direct income support to the farmers in a budget-neutral approach.\u201cRs 1,55,000 crore can provide income support of more than Rs 11,000 per hectare of net sown area in the country. Such support, structured equitably across different classes of farmers, would not only be administratively more efficient, but would encourage more judicious use of fertilisers, creating a win-win for the government and the farmers while saving the environment,\u201d said Abhishek Jain, fellow and director, Powering Livelihoods, CEEW.During the COP 26 summit last year, Modi had made five commitments from India to the world. These included a promise to get 50 per cent of the country's energy from renewable resources by 2030 and to reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by the same year.",

The inelastic supply of minerals is already increasing the prices of minerals which is likely to shoot up even further in the future.\u201dThe two main pillars for mitigation action to achieve net-zero carbon ambition are transition to clean and renewable sources of energy and storage of this energy, it said.The survey quoted a World Bank report on Minerals for Climate Action that this transition from conventional fossil fuel-based energy to clean energy as well as battery storage will be mineral intensive.Minerals and metals like copper, aluminum, iron, manganese, nickel etc are critical for developing clean energy sources like solar PV, wind, nuclear while minerals like lithium and graphite are important for energy storage, it said.It said the energy crisis being experienced by Europe brings to the fore the need for having a diversified mix of sources of energy of which fossil fuels are an important part.\u201cThe recent surge in prices of natural gas in Europe on account of higher energy demand coupled with cold spells across the region and slower winds to run wind turbines has resulted in lower electricity output. Simultaneously focus should be laid on building storage for intermittent electricity generation from solar PV and wind farms to ensure on-demand energy supply,\u201d it said.",

It is estimated that the blending target at 10 per cent would be achieved during 2022,  it added.To achieve these targets, the government has allowed production of ethanol from different feed stocks viz B-Hy and C-Hy molasses, cane juice, sugar syrup, sugar and damaged food grains including surplus FCI rice, maize, etc. by the distilleries either attached with sugar mills or standalone.Financial assistance in the form of interest subvention are also provided to eligible distilleries for augmentation of ethanol production capacity in the country. The ethanol supply under the EBP programme, which was only 38 crore litres in Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2013-14, has increased to 173.3 crore litres during ESY 2019-20 and is expected to be more than 302 crore litres by the end of ESY 2020-21 to achieve approximately 8.1 per cent blending,  the document said.The ethanol blending target for ESY 2021-22 is 10 per cent which is to progressively increase to 20 per cent by year 2025.",

        "articleBody": "India has been progressing steadily in decarbonizing the energy mix. The county has doubled the renewable energy (RE) capacity in five years, from 50GW at the end of 2016 to 105GW at the end of 2021. Except for the year 2020, when COVID-19 affected the growth, rest of the years have witnessed capacity addition over 10GW annually. In terms of electricity generation, RE has also contributed considerably to green the consumption mix. This is exemplified by the graph below which reflects that RE contribution has increased from monthly average of 12 Billion Units (BUs) in 2020 to 14 BU in 2021. Further, the recent announcement of cumulative deployment of 500GW clean capacity target by 2030 would see increased penetration of clean energy in the overall energy mix. The year 2021 was a landmark one for the RE sector. Cumulative 100GW capacity installation milestone was achieved in this year which further adds up to 150GW if one includes hydro power projects into it. The country has committed to achieving net zero by the year 2070 which supports the adoption of RE and other clean energy technologies not only for electricity but for other energy applications as well. Some of these key drivers of RE in India include:Policy push for grid connected and off-grid systems: The Government of India and the state governments have been promoting the implementation of both grid connected and off-grid projects in every nook and corner of the country. There are supportive policies, rebates and relaxations on charges and losses for electricity distribution, capital subsidy, incentives, etc which are helping the growth. Further, the government is also focusing on greening the electricity requirement of agriculture sector by solarization of feeders and pumps through PM-KUSUM scheme. Besides, the government is promoting deployment of RE systems with livelihood applications as well to make the consumers self-reliant and sustainable in energy mix. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes: Solar cell and solar module manufacturing: The PLI scheme with a financial outlay of INR 4500 crore for manufacturing of \u2018High Efficiency Solar PV Modules\u2019 witnessed an overwhelming response and received proposals to setup 54.8GW of manufacturing capacity. Based on the success, the Government of India is planning to increase the PLI scheme outlay to INR 24,000 crores.89228322Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Manufacturing: In May 2021, govt approved PLI scheme for manufacturing of 50GWh ACC batteries with an estimated outlay of INR 18,100 crore for 5 years, starting from the date of manufacturing. The scheme has received encouraging response from battery manufacturers from across the globe, expressing their interest to enter into the Indian market.Key areas of concern in the sector:Renegotiation of tariffs: Some states have recently asked project developers to renegotiate the tariff agreed in the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for renewable energy (RE) projects, with an expectation to reduce the tariff to current market rates. This would adversely affect the viability of the projects, given these were installed at the prevalent market costs, which have reduced considerably over the years, and thus would not ensure recovery of investments made into the projects.Imposition of taxes and duties on RE components: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) on RE products from 5% to 12%, which would increase the cost of project development. Further, Basic Customs Duty (BCD) of 25% on solar PV cells and 40% on solar modules would be applicable starting April 2022, which will increase the cost of project dependent upon imported cells and modules. High cost of finance: The sector, despite being established, witnesses high rate of interest to finance the project, leading to increased cost, and thus the tariffs. Electricity not covered under GST: The components involved in setting up a project attracts GST, however, the electricity supplied through it does not come under the ambit of GST, and thus the tax outlay is not reimbursed. Expensive cost of manufacturing: The country is promoting self-reliance in in RE components such as solar cells, modules, storage, etc., however, the cost of electricity is high which affects the cost of production and hampering the growth of domestic manufacturing.89228324 Reduced incentives to export equipment: To optimally utilize the manufacturing capacities, the manufacturers export turbines, etc. to other countries; however, the incentives have been reduced considerably in recent years, which leads to increased cost and thus reduces competitiveness for Indian equipment in global market. Expectations from the union budget 2022-23: The sector has to swiftly move from current 105GW to 500GW clean energy capacity by 2029-30. A roadmap & yearly plan should be developed immediately and budgetary push will help. The following enablers in the union budget can push the RE sector to expand the reach:Passage of Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020: The Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 paves way for a number of enabling frameworks including de-licensing of power distribution. It would be pertinent if the bill can be passed to allow for improved competition and efficiency in the sector. PLI for smaller capacities and other components : The recent PLI scheme for solar manufacturing is considered a success given overwhelming response received from the industry. A similar PLI scheme can be rolled out for smaller manufacturing capacities as well to promote other potential manufacturers with lower investment appetite. Further, PLI scheme can also be announced for other components contributing to domestic RE manufacturing, which can help reduce the cost across the value chain. Roll back increased GST on RE components: The recent revision of GST on RE components from 5% to 12% has adversely affected the cost of setting up RE projects and thus needs to be revisited and revised to lowest possible slab to ensure cost effectiveness of the systems. Revision in duty structure: The budget can also focus on revising the duty structure for manufacturing of RE components, and avoid any inverted duty structure, wherein raw materials attract higher GST, while the finished good attracts lower GST, thus increasing the tax liability on the project. Include electricity in GST: Imposition of GST on electricity will help the manufacturers and suppliers neutralize the tax implication and would further add to the government\u2019s revenue inflow. Import duty exemptions and export incentives: While India is expanding the RE manufacturing base, it is important to promote the import of equipment/component till the manufacturing is self-reliant. Further, sectors like wind which are under utilized domestically can be promoted with export incentives to utilize their manufacturing base and improve global competitiveness. Facilitate ease of financing to RE projects: RE projects, including manufacturing, can be facilitated with relaxed norms and interest rates to promote RE adoption. Hydrogen Purchase Obligation: The Government of India may announce Hydrogen Purchase Obligation in this budget 2022-23. This can be supplemented with incentives and support mechanisms to enable industries such as fertilizer, refineries, and other entities to be obligated, to adopt interventions to setup green hydrogen plants or procure green hydrogen for their respective industrial applications. Roadmap for new technologies such as Offshore wind, green hydrogen, energy storage: The government may roll out a roadmap with incentives and support mechanism such as concessional loans, dedicated zones, etc. to promote implementation of projects based on green hydrogen, energy storage, etc. Further, the states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu itself have about 71GW of offshore wind potential combined. However, the technology is yet to see any commercial implementation, and thus can be supported with financial support in form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to ensure financial viability of initial projects and support development of the sector.

        "articleBody": "The government may provide for targeted fiscal incentives and allocation of funds for promotion of green hydrogen in the country in Union Budget 2022-23, which is slated to be unveiled in Parliament on Tuesday. The government launched National Hydrogen Mission in 2021. Earlier this month, Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh had indicated that a green hydrogen policy will be unveiled in February which would feature many incentives to boost green hydrogen in the country.   While 2021 saw the launch of National Hydrogen Mission, it is likely that the Budget may provide for targeted fiscal incentives for R&D in green hydrogen segment, creation of domestic supply chain for hydrogen and reduce customs duties on electrolysers to boost green hydrogen production,  says Venkatesh Raman Prasad, Partner, J Sagar Associates (JSA).  Prasad is of the view that India's commitment at COP 26 of achieving net zero emissions by 2070 and meet 50 per cent of energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030 shows that the government intends to focus on cleaner sources of energy.  Hemant Mallya, Senior Programme Lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) opines that green hydrogen has many industrial uses and can potentially decarbonise many hard-to-abate sectors, like the iron and steel industry.  He says that an outlay of Rs 1,200 crore by 2024 in the upcoming Budget could trigger pilots in various end-use applications such as testing green hydrogen readiness of natural gas pipelines, underground hydrogen storage, and pilots for equipment such as furnaces, boilers, and process heaters.  He suggests that another Rs 165 crore could support R&D, especially on catalysts and electrolyser membranes, finding substitutes for critical minerals, setting up testing labs and enforcing safety standards.  These investments would help indigenize green hydrogen production and use as an industrial fuel, he opines.  Davinder Sandhu, Co-founder & Chairman, Primus Partners says that electrolysers used to manufacture hydrogen at present are expensive and bringing down their cost will contribute to reducing the cost of green hydrogen.  This will enable the country to meet the target of establishing 10 gigawatt of domestic manufacturing capacity as well as making India a global leader in the sector, he opines.  In this regard, he suggests that the government should consider a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme which can support indigenization of electrolysers and scaling up of green hydrogen production at optimized cost.  Earlier this month, Union minister R K Singh had said a new green hydrogen policy will feature incentives like free power transmission for 25 years, dollar denominated bids, offer of land in renewable energy parks and land allocation near ports for creating bunkers for green hydrogen or ammonia.",

        "articleSection": "Industry",
        "articleBody": "Union Budget 2022-23 is an important and challenging one for the government. The Covid-19 pandemic has persisted for over two years, devastating people\u2019s lives, livelihoods and the nation\u2019s economy. The ongoing third wave, though milder than earlier variants, has added further stress on the national exchequer, draining our healthcare system, the people\u2019s investing and purchasing powers and their employment opportunities. Under such circumstances, the finance minister has the unenviable task of announcing a budget that must deliver tripartite benefits: of supporting the people and their livelihoods, enabling economic repair and climate-smart policies that will propel the nation towards our ambitious Conferences of Parties 26 (COP26) commitments.Students of public administration will understand that while national budgets primarily balance income and expenditure, they are also instruments by which the government outlines important national policies and drives its developmental agenda. What kind of nation-building vision it has, is generally evident from its allocations and policies. For example, India\u2019s last budget recognized hydrogen fuel as an important energy source for its future and pushed for bus-based urban mobility, indicating its interest in a carbon-neutral, climate-smart development agenda. In continuation with this vision was Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s commitments at COP26 in Glasgow to achieve net-zero by 2070 and reduce emission intensity of the nation\u2019s GDP by 2030. Following such generous commitments, this year\u2019s budget will be significant in shaping on-ground action by building state, city and district-level capacity, enabling fund flow and implementation guidelines. Provisions made in the budget will go a long way in building credibility about India\u2019s global commitments.COP26: Ground-level action, incentives for private sectorTo pave the path towards India\u2019s COP26 climate commitments, real action must begin on the ground, in geographies where the understanding of climate issues is limited and not always up to date. The country needs thousands of ground-level champions who understand the nuances of climate action and incorporate it into their day-to-day work.This warrants appropriate capacity building for not just senior officials in state secretariats, but for officials and elected representatives in municipal corporations, zilla parishads, block and district offices, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and corporates. An intensive program to build on-ground champions could add long-term value to the nation\u2019s international commitments.A quantum leap in the installation of renewable energy (RE) capacity is also vital. Public budget cannot meet the entire cost, hence incentivizing private initiatives will make it cost-competitive.Way back in the 1980s, China had deployed RE as a tool for powering remote areas. India\u2019s Rural Electrification Program however relies on grid-based electricity. Today, our climate commitments coupled with the falling costs of RE, make a strong case for an ambitious program to power remote areas with solar, wind and other forms of clean energy.Our regulatory systems need to be upgraded now, to make RE viable for our distribution companies. Currently, they are losing several best paying industrial customers, who are setting up their own solar facilities to get cheaper electricity, driving the distribution companies deeper into the red. Major reforms are needed to correct this and integrate RE with the private sector.Pandemic response: Decentralizing healthcare, public-friendly reformsAs the pandemic put immense pressure on our healthcare system, a question that persisted was whether it is time to invest in a decentralized and distributed system that reaches a large number of cases across the country. Allocations towards innovative first level care across geographies \u2013 so that only the most serious cases require the capacity of centralized, high-level medical infrastructure \u2013 could help distribute the pressure on the medical fraternity during an unprecedented pandemic. A fledgling step towards this end is the introduction of self-testing kits, but additional capacity in the form of early-stage medical attention is warranted.Yet another learning from Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown, was the need to initiate policies and investments that are sympathetic to the public, helping them in livelihood building, boosting rural and urban jobs evenly, to reduce the need for migration.Over the past months, it has been a tough exercise to persuade farmers to go back to their villages after a long protest on the outskirts of Delhi. With many important states including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab going to vote this year, solving the agricultural conundrum should be a high priority in the Budget.Farmers have faced several hardships in the recent past and need a resolution to their problems. They are looking for ways to improve their income. Offering incentives to reduce post-harvest food loss is an important and often ignored aspect of agricultural reforms. India needs a considerable amount of farm-level processing, improved transportation and warehousing systems. The use of decentralized RE to power local processing units could play a significant role. A focus on empowering the informal sector with rural and urban jobs, capacity building and education, relief in key sectors like agriculture, housing, food production and its value chain and MSME could help reduce the nation\u2019s economic stress and support holistic recovery. Recently, at the Davos Agenda, global experts were cautiously optimistic about the imminent end of Covid-19. If this assessment rings true, then India\u2019s Union Budget 2022-23 indeed has the potential to be a watershed towards delivering our climate commitments, strengthening ourselves from future pandemics, and ameliorating farmers and the informal sector.(The author is CEO, World Resources Institute India.

        "articleBody": "NITI Aayog has proposed government to include electric vehicles in the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s priority-sector lending guidelines, the move it says will give a significant push to retail lending for EVs.NITI Aayog, in its report on EVs with Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and RMI India released on Friday said, banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in India have the potential to achieve an electric vehicle (EV) financing market size of Rs 40,000 crore by 2025 and Rs 3.7 lakh crore by 2030.  However, retail finance for EVs has been slow to pick up,  it said.\u201cFinancial institutions have an important role to play in accelerating the adoption of EVs in India and supporting the decarbonisation of road transport,\u201d said Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog said.\u201cRBI\u2019s PSL mandate has a proven track record of improving the supply of formal credit towards areas of national priority. It can provide a strong regulatory incentive for banks and NBFCs to scale their financing to EVs,  Kant added. Priority-sector lending aims to expand financial access and support employment opportunities in India. In order to meet these goals, the Aayog has suggested in the report that the RBI may consider various EV segments and use cases based on five parameters: socio-economic potential, livelihood generation potential, scalability, techno-economic viability, and stakeholder acceptability.\u201cBuyers are unable to access low-interest rates and long loan tenures for EVs as banks are concerned about resale value and product quality,  Clay Stranger, managing director, RMI said, adding piority-sector lending can encourage banks to fast-track India\u2019s transition to EVs and help achieve our 2070 climate goals.The Aayog has suggested in the report that electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and commercial four-wheelers are early segments to prioritise under PSL.Further, it suggests recognition of EVs as an infrastructure sub-sector by the ministry of finance and the incorporation of EVs as a separate reporting category under the RBI. Multiprong solutions such as these are needed not only for EV penetration and businesses, but also for the financial sector and India\u2019s 2070 net-zero target,  it added.To maximise the impact of the inclusion of EVs, the report also recommends a clear sub-target and penalty mechanism for priority sector lending to renewable energy and EVs.  Moving forward, the engagement of other ministries and industry stakeholders will be important to ensuring the guidelines designed can effectively enhance EV investment in India,  it added.",

        "articleBody": "There is much to look forward to in the 2022-23 Budget. The government has already set a target to achieve 500 gigawatts (GW) and a 50% share of energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030, backed up with a net-zero emissions by 2070 pledge delivered at COP26. As the government would know, in order to achieve these ambitious targets, the renewable energy sector will require substantial government financial support in the form of targeted subsidies, import tariff restrictions, interest-free loans, better tax structures and careful policy framing for both the states and discoms. The 2022-23 budget will likely see government attempting to lower its fiscal and current account deficit, providing a huge push for domestic manufacturing to reduce reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports.The government will build on new energy initiatives already actioned during 2021 in response to the COVID-19-induced crisis and to boost economic growth. That includes the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for renewable energy including batteries to boost domestic manufacturing, the greening of Indian railways, priority sector lending to renewable projects, and the provision of further capital to the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA).India is currently 4th largest in installed wind power and 5th largest in installed solar power in world. Overall India is 4th largest country in terms of installed renewable energy. India's renewable energy sector has a share of ~38% in total installed generation capacity (149GW as of Oct-21) in the country. After looking to achieve 175GW target earlier than expected, the country has revised and set an ambitious target to achieve a capacity of 227 GW worth of renewable energy by the end of 2022, which expands to 450 GW by 2030. This is the world's largest expansion plan in renewable energy. Almost adding ~33GW each year or a CAGR of ~13% for next 9 years. Having 26GW of tenders already in pipeline with various supportive measures to sector including 100% FDI, PLI Scheme, dedicated investment outlay of $70-80Bn etc the sector should continue to maintain momentum in medium term. -- Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock BrokersIn its previous Budget, the government approved 10GW of integrated manufacturing capacity for \u2018High Efficiency Solar PV Modules\u2019 with a financial outlay of Rs 4,500crore (US$616 million) using the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. The bid received a tremendous response from the industry and forced India\u2019s central government to reconsider. They eventually increased the PLI amount for solar module manufacturing with an additional Rs19,000 crore (US$2.5 billion)) confirmed. It is hoped that in Budget 2022/23 the PLI scheme will be extended to include the manufacturing of polysilicon, wafers, and ingots as well, to ensure backward integration. Doing so will reduce India\u2019s reliance on imports across the value chain. Cabinet recently approved a fresh equity infusion of Rs1,500 crore (US$205 million) into the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) to boost its lending capacity. Such a move demonstrates again the government\u2019s commitment to assisting local bodies help achieve the country\u2019s 450GW renewable energy target. Despite its ongoing support to the sector, more can be done. Additional government financial support is needed to increase the uptake and development of new energy technologies such as battery storage, green hydrogen, hydro, offshore wind, and so forth. Renewable energies such as solar and wind are now price competitive in India \u2013 and cheaper than coal or gas-powered generation. Battery storage however \u2013 critical for integrating increasing renewable energy into the grid - is still an expensive technology. The government must offer essential viability gap funding for new energy storage projects, and emerging green hydrogen and offshore wind projects. Once these technologies are more established, the government can leave the price determination to the markets. Further, the transmission and distribution network will soon require strengthening. The government should urgently plan for modernizing and digitalizing the transmission system for better integration of new renewable energy capacity into the grid.India is lagging behind its 40GW solar rooftop installation target by 2022. In order to facilitate uptake, in Budget 2022/23 the Government should offer more capital subsidies and concessional loans, particularly to Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) and residential customers. Budget 2022/23 could put in place the necessary supports for India to complete the third successful chapter of its renewable energy story.Necessary government financial and policy support for newer clean energy technologies will determine the level of success in which India is able to achieve its renewable energy target.

        "articleBody": "Renewable sector in India has seen significant evolution and growth in the past few years with the government laying major emphasis on development of clean energy sources. The sector is one of the major contributors to infrastructure development in India and with the newer emerging themes (Green Hydrogen, Storage, Electric Vehicles, Solar Cell and Electrolyser Manufacturing, etc), it is leading the way for sustainable development and creating a better future.According to publicly available data, since March 2014, the sector has seen a growth of 2.73 times in total installed renewable energy capacity in the country. In line with its announcement at COP26 climate summit in Glasgow to increase the non-fossil energy capacity to 500GW by 2030, coupled with the target to become a net zero carbon emitter by 2070, India is set to push the pedal to accelerate the pace of development. Union Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy, Mr R K Singh, has already commented that investment in renewable energy sector is expected to cross $15 billion in 2022. One can expect this number to rise in the coming years if India is to meet the above target and attracting patient foreign capital is pivotal.The government has taken significant steps towards this end by easing our regulatory and tax policies. Amongst others, tax exemption to Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and Pension Funds (PFs), lower tax rate of 15% to new power companies, abolition of dividend distribution tax, etc, have been well appreciated by the investor community. Streamlining of Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) regulations alongside the agenda of monetizing some of the marquee infra assets through this route, has certainly boosted investors\u2019 confidence and paved the way for successful evolution of this alternate investment route for foreign investors.Despite laudable measures undertaken by the government, the sector still continues to face challenges on the tax front. Budget 2022 provides a unique opportunity to the Government to address some of these concerns, given the uptick in the economic activity (post pandemic lows) and with global investors looking to invest significant capital in emerging markets. Outlined below are some of the specific areas which, in our view, are on the watchlist of key stakeholders in the renewable energy space vis-\u00e0-vis the upcoming Budget:Investment based tax incentives for companies in electric vehicle manufacturing/charging business to give boost to the EV sector.Incentivising R&D, technology adoption and investments in the storage segment.We have seen India\u2019s first SPAC for renewable group last year. Renewable groups are looking at alternate sources for growth capital as well as providing exit to their investors. Direct overseas listing route was announced by the government last year. However, the rules and regulations for the same are still under works. Companies which are looking to raise funding through the listing route are expecting more clarity on the road map for direct overseas listing regulations and relevant tax laws.Tax consolidation scheme for renewable companies is the need of the hour. By its very nature, a renewable group has multiple entities, and each entity is taxed separately leading to additional tax liability on account of inability to set off losses, tax credits within the group, complexities around intra-group transactions, multitude of compliances, etc. Fund mobilisation within the group becomes a key pain point on account of certain tax issues. Providing tax consolidation for renewable companies will go a long way in addressing some of these issues and provide significant ease of doing business for such companies.It would be helpful if GST rates on renewable-solar projects are retained at 5 per cent, as was originally notified during the implementation of GST. Alternatively, the GST Council\u2019s stipulation of the deemed 70:30 ratio on contract value for GST computation at 5 per cent and 18 per cent respectively could well be changed to the applicable 90:10 ratio. This is because in solar projects, material accounts for 90 per cent of the value of the contract wherein the service component is only to the extent of 10 per cent. This will help rationalisation of GST tax rate to 6.3 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis current tax rate of 13.8 per cent.The government should consider deferring levy of Basic Customs Duty on imported modules (which otherwise is effective from 01 April 2022), and instead provide relevant subsidies/incentives/tax concessions to the domestic module manufacturers thereby driving global competitiveness for the domestic players, without disrupting the demand-supply situation for modules and the current generation pipeline of IPPs.In relation to InvITs, the government would do well to clarify the availability of tax treaty benefit on dividend income distributed by InvIT to non-resident shareholders. The same will provide more certainty to the non-resident investors on tax assumptions vis-\u00e0-vis dividend returns from InvITs. Also, the period of holding for the listed InvIT units should be brought at par with the listed shares to provide a level playing field for the listed InvITs as compared to listed companies.Rationalisation of some of the conditionalities attached to tax exemption provided to SWFs and PFs and coming up with specific explanatory rules is much awaited, as is the need for waiving the withholding tax applicability on payment of income to such Funds by the InvIT.The government can certainly help accelerate the growth of the sector in 2022 and beyond, by incentivising the industry and rationalising the overall regulatory, fiscal, tax and financing framework for the sector. Addressing some of the abovementioned industry issues could offer new impetus for investments and contribute towards ease of doing business in India, thereby instilling investor confidence, and fueling more investment into the sector.India has shown character with a base that is getting stronger year on year and is  systematically  unleashing itself towards creating a destination which shall meet investment philosophies confidently. So, the interpretation of the budget when it comes and the pre-budget expectations that have been listed should be viewed in the backdrop of creating an  investment climate  that supports a greener future and sustainable development.

        "articleBody": "It\u2019s simply impossible to imagine an Indian city without two wheelers. A large part of the country's population primarily moves on two-wheelers.In India, more than 25% of people commute to work either on bicycles or two-wheelers, as they are an affordable and reliable means of transport for people across urban and rural areas. Also, almost one-third of all households own one. It\u2019s widely held that close to 75 million two-wheelers ply on Indian roads, including the ones in tier I, II and III cities. Moreover, India adds 17-18 million two-wheelers each year on the roads.But the fact is, two-wheelers pollute a lot! It may come as a surprise to many, but two-wheelers emit nearly the same CO2 emissions as a car. Therefore putting the majority of the onus of emission reduction on the shoulders of those riders. In the light of this, the switch to electric vehicles is inevitable. While the government has come up with EV subsidy programs, it is FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicle) that has facilitated in driving the adoption of electric-scooters on Indian roads. However, the rate of adoption is still low primarily due to the heavy upfront cost and the lack of charging infrastructure.This is where e-bikes come in! With their ease of use and maintenance, low upfront cost, high energy efficiency and portable design, e-bikes have rapidly been seen as the most viable option for intra-city mobility. Delivery personnel, for eg., have seen an effective rise in delivery fulfilments when using e-bikes as opposed to the traditional scooter and motorcycle. E-bikes have become a very eco-friendly alternative for the large population using two-wheelers. Therefore, as opposed to electric two-wheelers, electric bicycles are the right transport for the government to promote, as it not only helps in going green, but also help people to be more active in their lifestyle, thus reducing the dependency on healthcare systems. Also with Covid-19 and its multiple waves, consumers have realized the immense value of health and chosen to adopt safer and reliable ways of commuting. So, from the perspective of e-mobility, the government of India needs to bring much required changes to create optimism in this industry and help the industry and consumers grow multi-fold. The electric bicycle industry is much due for its ask for inclusion in the FAME II subsidy scheme. The government should consider incentivizing the consumers. This will provide a big push to the e-Bicycle industry which today stands at around 40,000 units annual volume. Given the right push, this can go to over a million units per annum in the coming years.Also the government should consider schemes for creating and regulating more dedicated cycling lanes. There are very few dedicated lanes today, and they too are most often occupied by the conventional 2-wheelers.The dedicated lanes should be regulated with penalties etc. for violators.Further, the government should offer income tax benefits to consumers who choose e-Bicycles considering fitness and the benefits of going green.To conclude, knowing where the country stands with its two-wheeler pollution levels across Indian cities, it needs to take a stand to make the tough calls for a cleaner, greener urban future across the country. And, the time is now!",

        "articleBody": "The Union Budget 2022-23 should focus on long-term policy stability to promote investments in the renewable energy sector, according to industry executives. They also think the government should reduce customs duties on electrolysers to boost green hydrogen space, and provide tax rebates to the residential solar prosumers. \u201cBudgetary allocations for the expansion of domestic manufacturing capabilities, such as the PLI scheme, will help boost RE growth - this is expected to provide an impetus for manufacturing of clean energy equipment such as solar panels, electrolysers, batteries and wind turbines,\u201d Sumant Sinha, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), ReNew Power, one of the largest independent power producer (IPP) in clean energy space, told ETEnergyWorld. Sinha added that reducing customs duties on RE equipment such as batteries and electrolysers will boost areas like hydrogen, storage and electric vehicles. \u201cAdequate, situation-changing budgetary allocations towards reforming the distribution sector are the crying need of the hour, as distribution continues to remain the weakest link in the value chain for power,\u201d he said.Sanjeev Aggarwal, managing director and CEO, Amplus Solar, a Gurugram-based distributed energy company and member of the PETRONAS Group, said that it will be useful for the country to provide tax rebates to the residential solar prosumers so that the solar rooftop and storage segments can pick up in a big way. According to the industry executives, one of the biggest challenges for investors in the sector has been the issue of delayed payments from discoms to independent power producers. Aggarwal added that the weakest link at the discoms\u2019 end still remains to be addressed and it will be prudent for the government to provide a long-term solution to ensure viability so that the large-scale power plants can continue to attract investments.\u201cI expect the Union Budget 2022 to provide a strong fillip to the RE sector, which will catalyze our journey towards fulfilling the ambitious climate commitments unveiled at the COP26 summit in Glasgow,\u201d said Srivatsan Iyer, Global CEO, Hero Future Energies, a Delhi-based IPP in renewable energy.He said that clear policy interventions are required for the industry to make India the world\u2019s green hydrogen hub by bringing green hydrogen cost at par with hydrogen produced with conventional processes. This should include both supply-side measures, such as viability gap funding for new projects, and demand-side measures such as mandated use levels for green hydrogen in hard-to-abate industries like refineries and fertilizers, he added.\u201cI also hope the Budget encourages integrated battery energy storage systems (BESS) through provisions such as customs duty exemption for import of lithium-ion batteries, introduction of storage purchase obligations for discoms and financial incentives for commercial and industrial customers using BESS power,\u201d said Iyer.According to Gyanesh Chaudhary, vice-chairman and managing director, Vikram Solar, a Kolkata-based solar module manufacturer, the Budget should include targeted initiatives and policies to strengthen the domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem.\u201cThis will accelerate economic recovery, create jobs, attract investments, increase exports and enable India\u2019s energy security. The Budget must also continue to focus on boosting private investments and enhance expenditure on infrastructure,\u201d he said.He further added that the 80 per cent accelerated depreciation benefit should be reinstated for the solar industry, the National Clean Energy Fund should be made available to solar manufacturing firms, and 5 per cent interest subvention on term-loan and working capital and upfront Central Financial Assistance of 30 per cent on capex should be made.According to Saif Dhorajiwala, co-founder and executive director, Fourth Partner Energy, a Hyderabad-based solar energy company, India has set itself aggressive decarbonisation goals and this transition will gain momentum only when significantly cheaper clean energy tariffs are realized by the end consumer. \u201cThe hike in the goods and services tax (GST) from 5 per cent to 12 per cent on specified renewable energy devices and parts, post October 2021 has negatively impacted solar and wind tariffs,\u201d he said. This combined with the proposed BCD on solar equipment from 1 April will only hurt RE developers further. If the government levies a 5 per cent GST on coal while burdening the renewables sector with 12 per cent GST and an additional BCD of 40 per cent for solar equipment, it is sending out the wrong message to the industry and consumers, because the effective tax rate on solar panels alone will become 56.8 per cent.\u201cUndoubtedly domestic manufacturing of solar equipment has to be incentivized, but that cannot be at the cost of industry\u2026 We are confident the revenue department will revisit the duty structure on renewable energy equipment,\u201d he added.Parliament\u2019s Budget session will begin on 31 January 2022 and the Union Budget will be presented on 1 February 2022.",

        "articleBody": "The government is planning to convert its inland waterways and army trucks into methanol engines with an aim to promote alternative fuel to reduce India's dependence on imported petrol and diesel. Top government official told ET that talks are on with Deccan Water Treatment to undertake the conversion of existing diesel engines into methanol as the government enhances focus on green fuel.\u201cNITI Aayog is facilitating conversion of inland waterways at Haldia, Varanasi and Allahabad under this project,\u201d the official quoted above said. The project will be implemented through Deccan ScandiNAOS India, a 70:30 joint venture between Deccan Water Treatment and ScandiNAOS with the latter being the technology partner. The Aayog has drawn a comprehensive plan to replace 20% of crude imports from methanol alone which will help bring down pollution in the country by more than 40%. Under the plan, 500 barges will be converted to run on 100% methanol replacing heavy oil or bunker oil, resulting in reduction of pollutants into seas and rivers. This could be followed by conversion of army trucks into methanol and even diesel railway engines as India scales up domestic production of methanol. \u201cDeccan ScandiNAOS India aims to drive the \u2018Methanol Economy\u2019 program in India, in-line with the government\u2019s initiative to promote and adopt alternative fuels in the country, by providing design and supply methanol fuel solutions for internalcombustion engines as well as conversion for existing conventional fuel engines to run on methanol,\u201d Animesh Sarkar, chairman and managing director of the JV company said.Methanol is a low carbon, hydrogen carrier fuel produced from high ash coal, agricultural residue, CO2 from thermal power plants and natural gas and the government feels it is the best pathway for meeting India\u2019s commitment to COP 21.It is estimated that the cost of gasoline including taxes is Rs 94.49 per litre and the cost of ethanol, including taxes on an energy equivalent basis with gasoline is Rs 69.9 while the cost of methanol on an energy equivalent basis with gasoline is Rs 37.6, making methanol more economical compared to ethanol and petrol. Even the production of methanol from coal is the most economically viable option for India, with other sources being natural gas, naphtha, biomass etc. This is because coal reserves are abundant in India and relatively cheaper compared to natural gas or crude oil, a significant proportion of which is imported",

        "articleBody": "The government has allowed government entities to offer land to private agencies setting up public charging stations through bidding starting with a floor price of Rs 1 per unit.The land available with government agencies can be offered to PSUs at a concessional rate of Rs 1 per unit for setting up public charging stations. The tariff of public charging stations has also been capped to not exceed average cost of supply till March 2025. As per previous guidelines, the tariff for public charging stations was capped at 15% of the average cost of supply.Under the power ministry's revised promulgated guidelines and standards for charging infrastructure for Electric Vehicles (EV), revenue sharing model has been put in place, an official statement said. Also, they provide that the state government shall fix the ceiling of Service Charges to be charged by such charging stations.Land available with the government/public entities shall be provided for installation of public charging stations to a government/public entity on a revenue sharing basis for installation of Public Charging Station at a fixed rate of Rs 1/kWh (used for charging) to be paid to the Land-Owning Agency from such PCS business payable on quarterly basis, it said.\u201cA Model Revenue Sharing agreement has also been included under the guidelines. Such revenue sharing agreement may be initially entered by parties for a period of 10 years. The Revenue Sharing Model may also be adopted by the public Land-owning agency for providing the land to a private entity for installation of Public Charging Stations on bidding basis with floor price of ? 1 / kWh,\u201d the statement said. The guidelines aim to reduce the emission intensity of the country by promoting the entire EV ecosystem. They were last revised in June 2020.The statement said the guidelines include provisions for individual owners of Electric Vehicles and for Public Charging Stations (PCS).Owners may charge their electric vehicles at their residence/offices using their existing electricity connections. \u201cAny individual/entity is free to set up public charging stations without the requirement of a license provided that, such stations meet the technical, safety as well as performance standards and protocols laid down under the guidelines as well as norms/ standards/ specifications laid down by Ministry of Power, Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) and Central Electricity Authority (CEA) from time to time,\u201d it said.The guidelines have also been made technology agnostic by providing for international charging standards and the new Indian charging standards. They also provide that public charging stations or chains of charging stations may obtain electricity from any generation company through open access.\u201cOpen Access shall be provided for this purpose within 15 days of receipt of the application complete in all respects. They will be required to pay the applicable surcharge \u2013 equal to the current level of cross subsidy (not more than 20 percent, as per the Tariff Policy Guidelines), transmission charges and wheeling charges. No other surcharge or charges shall be levied except mentioned in this provision,\u201d it said.The government aims to achieve one charging station in a grid of 3 kms. In the first phase all mega cities and all existing connecting expressways are proposed to be taken up for coverage.",

Productive phone call with US @ClimateEnvoy Mr John Kerry. We agreed to take forward India-US Climate Action & Finance Mobilisation Dialogue.   India is on track to achieve Paris Accord & COP26 commitments in accordance with PM Shri @narendramodi ji's LIFE mantra,  Yadav tweeted.  At the United Nations' COP 26 held in Glasgow last year, Prime Minister Modi gave a mantra  LIFE-Lifestyle for Environment  for sustainable development through sustainable lifestyle.   The world today admits that lifestyle has a major role in climate change. I propose a one-word movement before all of you. This word is LIFE which means Lifestyle for Environment. Today, it's necessary that all of us come together and take forward LIFE as a movement,  he had said at the summit.  The India-US Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue was formally launched by Yadav and Kerry in the national capital in September last year.  Yadav had earlier said the dialogue will not only strengthen the India-US bilateral cooperation on climate and environment but will also help to demonstrate how the world can align swift climate action with inclusive and resilient economic development, taking into account national circumstances and sustainable development priorities.",

        "articleBody": "As the country moves more aggressively towards its decarbonisation goals with the overall energy economy shifting towards greener fuels, a Wall Street brokerage has said this space will see a capex of USD 395 billion by 2030. At COP21 in Paris, as part of its nationally determined contributions, New Delhi had committed to achieve 40 per cent of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil energy sources by 2030.  But the target was achieved well ahead of schedule in November 2021 with installed renewable energy capacity reaching 150.05 GW, and nuclear energy capacity at 6.78 GW, said the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy last month and reiterated its commitment to achieving 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.  This brings total non-fossil fuels based installed energy capacity to 156.83 GW, or 40.1 per cent of the total installed capacity of 390.8 GW, in line with the government announcement at the COP26 at Glasgow in November.  Addressing the media on Monday, Amish Shah, a research analyst at Bank of America Securities India, said the country now is aligned with large economies on decarbonisation efforts.  And this added focus will see the country incurring USD395 billion in capex towards decarbonisation during the decade ending 2030.  He did not however disclose how much of this has already been invested.  The decarbonisation move includes curtailing diesel intake, more aggressive shift to renewable energy, stepping up natural gas supply and intake, fledgling private sector push for becoming net-zero, improving energy efficiency by privatising power distribution across the country, better water treatment facilities.  Besides, increasing biofuel production, ramping up hydrogen supply and bringing in stringent decarbonisation regulations are also part of the government's green energy move. Efforts in this direction also include expanding rail freight capacity to ensure more goods are ferried by the railways, more metro rail projects by reducing diesel-powered public transport, improving technology at existing thermal plants, completing railway electrification, moving faster on the BSVI transition across the automobile industry, among others, the brokerage said.",

        "articleBody": "Outlook for the capacity addition in the renewable energy sector remains strong with a large project pipeline of over 55 Gw and competitive tariffs offered by these projects, ratings firm ICRA said.The commitment to climate change goals announced by India at the recent COP26 summit, including increasing the non-fossil power capacity to 500 GW and meeting 50% of energy requirement from renewable sources by 2030, further strengthens the investment prospects in the renewable energy sector.The capacity addition witnessed recovery in the first eight months of FY2022 with 8.2 Gw added against 3.4 Gw in 8M FY2021, it said. \u201cThe backlog of projects awarded by the Central nodal agencies and state distribution utilities remains large with under-development solar, wind and hybrid capacities of more than 55 Gw. Basis this pipeline, ICRA expects the RE capacity addition to increase from 7.4 Gw reported in FY2021 to 12.5 Gw in FY2022 and further to 16 Gw in FY2023,\u201d ICRA senior vice president & co-group head - corporate ratings Girishkumar Kadam said.He said this is also supported by the progress shown by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) in signing of power sale agreements (PSAs) & power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the last six months. Within the RE capacity, the capacity addition would be driven by the solar segment followed by the wind and hybrid segments.The downside risks for renewable energy sector in the near term emanate from the execution headwinds and supply chain challenges for procuring modules and wind turbine generators (WTGs). The average price of imported solar PV modules have increased by over 35% over the past 12 months, putting upward pressure on capital costs for solar power projects.Notwithstanding the same and the recent hike in GST rate for solar power equipment, the solar bid tariffs continue to remain highly competitive as seen from the quoted bid tariff of Rs 2.17 per unit in December 2021.The ability of the developers to secure modules within their budgeted costs and cost of debt funding at less than 8.5% remains important to make these projects viable. On the other hand, the wind segment continues to witness subdued capacity addition owing to execution headwinds, financing challenges for few developers and weak financial profile of some of the OEMs leading to supply side constraints, ICRA statement said.The sector has massive funding requirement to achieve the capacity targets announced at the COP26 summit. ICRA vice president and sector head - corporate ratings Vikram V said, \u201cThe investment requirement for achieving the non-fossil capacity target of 500 GW by FY2030 remains large at close to $300 billion. This apart, investments would be required in augmenting the transmission infrastructure to integrate the renewable power with the electricity grid as well as investments to create storage infrastructure. ICRA expects the investments towards transmission infrastructure and storage capabilities to be about $150-200 billion over the next 8.5 years, taking the overall investment requirement to $450-500 billion. The availability of adequate funding avenues at cost competitive rates remains critical to achieve these capacity targets.\u201dThe overall dues to RE IPPs from distribution utilities (discoms) in the eight key states have gone up by 43% to Rs 194 billion as of December 2021 from Rs 136 billion as of July 2021. The can be attributed to the continued delays by discoms in Andhra Pradesh amid the tariff issue and a large increase in dues from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana amid the liquidity stress faced by discoms in these states arising from inadequate tariffs and operating inefficiencies. Implementation of various reform oriented measures as well as timely tariff determination process including the focus on improving operating efficiencies by the state discoms remains key to turnaround the discom finances.ICRA\u2019s outlook for renewable energy sector remains stable driven by the favourable policy support, superior tariff competitiveness, large untapped potential and the presence of strong intermediate procurers like SECI.The credit profile of majority of ICRA-rated solar and wind IPPs in FY2022 YTD is supported by the satisfactory generation performance, availability of long-term PPAs, adequate liquidity buffer and presence of strong sponsors. The ratings agency has upgraded 24 entities against 13 downgrades in the solar and wind energy segment in 8M FY2022. The upgrades were driven by mix of factors such as reduction in project risk, demonstration of generation performance, improvement in parent credit profile and favourable debt refinancing, while the downgrades have been due to factors such as change in the sponsor profile, weak generation performance and delays in receiving payments, it said.",

A delegation comprising officials from NIMMA, Indian Solar Manufacturers Association, and All India Solar Industries Association met Sitharaman on Thursday and flagged concerns regarding manufacturing units that are on the verge of closing owing to the current duty-free window on solar panels and cells from China and other countries.  The finance minister assured them that the BCD (Basic Custom Duty) will be implemented as per schedule from April 1, 2022, a NIMMA statement said.  The delegation also appealed to her to exempt the module and cell line plant and machinery from import duty, it stated.   The meeting with the minister was promising as she recognised that the industry will require policy assistance to grow and achieve its full potential.   Implementation of BCD will bring relief to the domestic manufacturing industry. We hope that additional measures to address supply-chain gaps will be considered. Further, this is the peak time for developers to purchase modules, and I request them to promote the government's Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative and install Indian modules,  Manish Gupta - President, North India Module Manufacturers Association (NIMMA), said.  Bharat Bhut - Cofounder & Director, Goldi Solar, a solar manufacturer, said the decision is a boon for Indian module manufacturers who have been facing stiff price competition from imported modules.  Goldi Solar has also increased its module manufacturing capacity to 2.5 GW and plans to expand to 5 GW to align with the government's vision of becoming energy-independent with Made in India modules.  In the delegation, Manish Gupta, Vineet Mittal, Arpit Agarwal, Manish Agarwal and Sandeep Gupta were present on behalf of the solar associations.  NIMMA was established in October 2017 to promote solar PV modules manufacturers in India and voice the concerns of small and medium companies in the sector.  NIMMA assists its members to develop, promote and improve the product and manufacturing standards, joint marketing strategies and takes up the concerns of its members with authorities concerned.",

        "articleBody": "The commitments on emission control made by India at the recent Glasgow COP26 summit are expected to benefit the country in the long-term with new technologies in energy efficiency, carbon reduction and green fuels, rating agency ICRA said adding this is likely to attract investment in billions across sectors.ICRA, in its recent research report, has analysed India\u2019s commitment in two phases \u2013 up to 2030, and the net-zero target for 2070.Being a developing country, which is at an inflection point in terms of its energy consumption, the nation\u2019s per capita energy consumption is expected to surge 3x-4x over the long term. Parallel to this, India has also committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 1 bn MT by 2030. The country has additionally committed to a net-zero carbon emission target by the year 2070, by when the per capita energy consumption would have surged multifold from current levels, it said. \u201cIn order to achieve the net-zero target by 2070, a focused roadmap would be required. It calls for timely interventions by the government and large capex/investments in GHG emitting sectors like power, industry, and transport. These sectors together emit 90% of CO2 as per 2019 data of the International Energy Agency. Ambitious targets for COP26 open massive investment opportunities across segments stemming from 500 GW renewables by 2030, higher EV penetration (10% by 2025), 20% ethanol blending for petrol (3x increase from current levels), improvement in energy efficiencies (battery storage, smart cities, etc.) and improvement in carbon capture from enhancing green cover and use of advanced technologies. This would be a daunting task, and would need massive policy interventions to ensure investments across aforementioned sectors remain profitable enough to sustain well beyond 2030,\u201d Rohit Ahuja, Head of Research and Outreach, ICRA said.The five-pronged strategy presented during the COP26 summit includes higher generation and use of renewable energy sources for incremental energy needs, limiting and then reducing emissions from conventional sources of energy. This makes strategic sense considering recent success in capacity additions (>150 GW capacities commissioned), and coal power generation being the largest contributor to carbon emissions, the report said.CO2 emissions form 76% (~2 bn MT) of overall GHG emissions (~2.7 bn MT) in India, most of which (>80%) stem from the use of coal.Incremental addition of 5 times in non-fossil fuels power generation capacity by 2030 is required for which India would need about $450-500 bn investments including investment towards transmission infrastructure and storage capabilities.Higher reliance on renewables for energy sourcing will necessitate more and more dependence over the years to achieve net-zero, which has to be increased over years. The targeted emission intensity which is a multiple of GHG emission to per unit of GDP will need a lower pace of GHG emission growth compared to GDP.Carbon sequestration (means a natural or artificial process by which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and held in solid or liquid form) growth is estimated at 3-6% every year to achieve a reduction of 1 BT of carbon emission. It is critical in order to get to the net-zero position.A developing nation like India, with one of the highest economic growth globally, cannot afford ac Gross Zero with nil carbon emissions. Achieving net-zero by 2070 needs carbon sequestration at the same level of GHG emission, it said.This means, post-2030 projections, a steady pace of sequestration (1-3% range) would be needed to reach the net-zero levels in 2070. This calls out for a huge investment, which is estimated at annually Rs. 115-135 bn (per Niti Aayog report for carbon sequestration).Pollution in cities is increasing alarmingly and three Indian metro cities Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata feature in the list of top 10 most polluted cities in the world. Recent developments in Delhi, forcing the state government to take extreme steps (such as a partial lockdown) to ensure a decline in pollution levels, continues to indicate a deteriorating problem.\u201cBeing one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, India needs to find a fine balance between reduction in carbon emission, and surging energy needs. As the country enters the developed economy tag over the next few years, the per capita energy consumption is set to surge multifold (with China being 4x and the US being 10x of India). The government policies need to ensure no compromise in its ever-expanding energy needs that could hamper its growth ambitions, while simultaneously working towards removing the tag of one of the most polluting nations in the world,\u201d Rohit Ahuja, Head of Research and Outreach, ICRA said.",

        "articleBody": "The government is planning to draw up an energy transition roadmap for the oil and gas sector that could prove to be a key step on India's path to net-zero emissions by 2070. The oil ministry has set up the Energy Transition Advisory Committee headed by former petroleum secretary Tarun Kapoor, who demitted office in November, to draft the strategy.The panel will include representatives of all public-sector oil and gas companies and will reach out to other stakeholders in the sector. The committee has until the middle of 2022 to recommend a roadmap for the sector's transition. 'Oil Cos Already Preparing Plans'  Oil companies are already preparing their respective plans to increase clean energy portfolio and set net-zero targets, and these efforts will get captured by the committee's broader energy transition plan for the sector,  said Kapoor.As part of its efforts, the committee will review and take into consideration existing initiatives while developing an action plan. Before his appointment as petroleum secretary, Kapoor spent several years framing policies for the power and the renewable energy sectors and has been instrumental in pushing state-run oil companies to work toward a transition plan. 88603200The oil and gas sector is a key player in energy transition and meeting the net-zero target. The International Energy Agency's outlook for India, published in February, found that its current policies would see a huge expansion in the transport sector. An extra 25 million trucks are expected on the road by 2040 and more than 300 million vehicles will be added to India's fleet by that time.Unless there is a dramatic shift toward e-vehicles, the projections suggest that India's fossil fuel import bill will triple over the next two decades. Oil will be the largest component, driving India's import dependency to 90% from the current level of 75%, according to the IEA analysis. Industry and transport are likely to emerge as critical sectors as far as greenhouse gas emissions growth is concerned.In this context, the Energy Transition Advisory Committee that Kapoor will head takes on added importance. Besides working on harmonised transition plans for the oil companies, the committee has been tasked with preparing plans for alternatives to hydrocarbons.The committee will focus on scaling up infrastructure for biofuels that is based on a sustainable biomass supply chain. This is critical, particularly for the transition away from fossil fuels in the transport sector. DOWNSTREAM OPSTransition planning will require oil companies to draw up a road map for their downstream operations as well. This is expected to feature in the committee's road map recommendations as well. In this context, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have announced plans to set up a combined 22,000 EV charging stations, nearly a third of their total retail network, in a bid to offset any loss from the shift to electric mobility in the future.Green hydrogen, which has been identified as a priority, will be a focus area for the committee. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a national green hydrogen mission in his Independence Day speech. The committee will focus on value chain development for green hydrogen infrastructure.",

        "articleBody": "State-run power giant NTPC plans to rope in a strategic investor for its clean energy arm NTPC Renewable Energy (NREL) ahead of its listing on bourses in October 2022, according to a senior official. The listing of NREL is part of the state-run power giant's overall Rs 15,000-crore divestment plan in next three years. The divestment plan also includes listing of North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCdO) and NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVNL) by March 2024.  The plan also includes sale of its stake in NTPC-SAIL Power Company (NSPCL).   NTPC has planned to bring a strategic investor for NREL which is expected to be listed sometime in October 2022. The strategic investor would be roped in before the listing of NREL on bourses,  a senior official told PTI.  The official also stated that the company needs huge funds for meeting its target of having 60GW renewable energy capacity mainly through NREL, which would be 45 per cent of its total 130 GW installed generation capacity envisaged by 2032.  The equity component of NREL would be around Rs 50,000 crore and rest of the requirement would be met through long-term loans, debentures, bonds and other such modes.  The plan to have 60 GW RE capacity by 2032, would entail an investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore.  NREL, a 100 per cent subsidiary of NTPC Ltd, currently has a renewable project portfolio of 3,850 GW of which 970 MW projects are under construction and 2,880 MW projects have been won and are in different phases of implementation.  NTPC had incorporated NREL with the Registrar of Companies, NCT of Delhi & Haryana on October 7, 2020, to undertake renewable energy business. The present installed capacity of NTPC Group is 67,907.5 MW (including 13,675 MW through JVs/Subsidiaries) comprising of 48 NTPC Stations (23 coal-based stations, 7 gas-based stations, 1 hydro station, 1 small hydro, 15 solar PV and 1 wind-based station) and 26 joint venture stations (9 coal based, 4 gas based, 8 hydro, 1 small hydro, 2 wind and 2 solar PV).",

        "articleBody": "The Delhi government is going to ask e-commerce companies, food delivery services and cab aggregators to completely switch to electric vehicles as it aims to increase the EV share in total vehicle sales to 25 percent by 2024 to check air pollution, according to officials.It is also going to ask dealers and petrol pumps to not give fuel to vehicles without a pollution-under-check (PUC) certificate.Vehicle emissions account for around 40 percent of the city's air pollution. The government is going to take two major steps to check vehicular pollution - we will ask all aggregators including Zomato, Swiggy, Ola, Uber, etc. to completely switch to electric vehicles. These services account for 30 percent of the registered vehicles in Delhi,  an official told PTI. We are also considering directing dealers and petrol pumps not to supply fuel to vehicles without a (valid) PUC certificate,  he said.Directions under the Environment (Protection) Act in this regard are expected to be issued this week.Asked if a deadline will be given to aggregators to switch to EVs, a senior official in the transport department said,  It will be done in a phased manner. We will soon publish the draft guidelines. Apart from ramping up the electric charging infrastructure, the transport department is likely to initiate discussion on having a battery swapping infrastructure in private space. The Indraprastha Gas Limited has also taken a decision to install 50 battery swapping stations at CNG pumps in the capital,  the official said. Electric vehicles with swappable batteries are considerably cheaper. The most difficult category is two-wheelers... We have started a dialogue with vehicle aggregators to see how we can have a regulatory push for them to migrate to electric two-wheelers,  he added.The Delhi Electric Vehicles policy - introduced in August 2020 - aims at increasing the EV share in total vehicle sales to 25 percent by 2024.Only Flipkart (by 2030) and FedEx (by 2040) have established worldwide targets for converting their last-mile delivery fleets to electric vehicles, while DHL has set a 60 percent electrification target for its fleet.In October, the city government launched a massive drive to check PUC certificates and deployed around 500 teams at petrol pumps for this purpose.Under Section 190(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1993, vehicle owners not having a valid PUC can be fined up to Rs 10,000, or imprisoned for up to six months or both.The owners are required to get their vehicles tested to ascertain if they meet emission standards for pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, carbon dioxide.There are around 1,000 authorised pollution checking centres set up at petrol pumps and workshops in the city.Also, in compliance with the National Green Tribunal's directions, the Delhi government will deregister all diesel vehicles which will complete 10 years on January 1, 2022, and issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) so that they can be re-registered in other places.However, no NOC will be issued for diesel vehicles that have completed 15 years or more on the date of applying for it, according to an order issued earlier this month.Delhi is the most polluted capital in the world and is one of the fastest expanding cities in terms of population, according to Swiss air technology company, IQAir.According to a study conducted by the Automotive Research Association of India and The Energy and Resources Institute in 2018, vehicles contribute to about 40 percent of PM 2.5 emissions in Delhi.

        "articleBody": "After witnessing cloudy skies this year, the country's renewable energy sector is expected to boom with a likely investment of over USD 15 billion in 2022 as the government focuses on electric vehicles, green hydrogen, manufacturing of solar equipment as well as achieving the ambitious 175 GW renewable capacity target.  India, which has an installed renewable energy generation capacity of a little over 150 GW, aims to reach 175 GW in 2022. Out of the total mix, 100 GW would be from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from bio-power and 5 GW from small hydro power projects.   In 2022, we expect the investment in renewable energy to cross at least USD 15 billion,  Union Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy R K Singh told PTI.  According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) reports, new investment made in the clean energy sector in the country stood at USD 6.2 billion in 2020, USD 9.3 billion in 2019 and USD 10.8 billion in 2018. These figures were cited by the minister in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha last month.  The second wave of COVID-19, which started in April, had impacted implementation of various renewable energy projects as states imposed restrictions to curb the spread of infections.  During the 2014-2019 period, renewable energy programmes and projects in India attracted investments of USD 64.4 billion, as per REN21 Renewables 2020 Global Status Report.  Nevertheless, in 2021, new opportunities emerged. Indian companies have started exploring overseas markets to raise funds and in August, ReNew Power became the first Indian renewable energy company to list on Nasdaq.  Data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Industrial Trade (DPIIT) showed that Indian 'Non-Conventional Energy' sector received about USD 7.27 billion as FDI from 2014-15 up to June 2021. Out of the total amount, FDI to the tune of USD 797.21 million came in 2020-21.  On the country's march towards achieving the renewable energy capacity of 175 GW in 2022, the minister said,  We will achieve the 175 GW of renewable energy capacity target which was set by us (excluding large hydro).   In November, Singh said, the country achieved an installed capacity of 150 GW of renewable energy, including large hydro projects. There is 63 GW of renewable energy capacity which is under installation, which is expected to be completed next year, he noted.  At COP 21, as part of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), India committed to achieving 40 per cent of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil energy sources by 2030. India has achieved this target in November 2021 itself.  As on November 30, the country's installed renewable energy capacity stood at 150.54 GW, comprising solar (48.55 GW), wind (40.03 GW), small hydro power (4.83 GW), bio-power (10.62 GW) and large hydro (46.51 GW). The nuclear energy-based installed electricity capacity is at 6.78 GW.  Together, the non-fossil-based installed energy capacity is 157.32 GW, which is 40.1 per cent of the total installed electricity capacity of 392.01 GW.  India aims to have 500 GW of installed renewable energy (RE) capacity by 2030.  Talking about boosting investments in the RE space, Singh said,  We have also opened the gates for installation of RE and selling it through open access. Now, anybody can set up RE capacity and sell it wherever it wants.   In 2021, the government introduced the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme 'National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules' with an outlay of Rs 4,500 crore to support and promote manufacturing of high efficiency solar photo voltaic (PV) modules.  These include the upstage vertical components like cells, wafers, ingots and polysilicon. The initiative is expected to reduce import dependence in the solar PV sector.  Pursuant to the decision, a tender inviting bids for manufacturing of high efficiency solar PV modules was issued. As many as 18 bids were received and that could help add another around 55 GW of solar PV module manufacturing capacity to the present capacity of around 11 GW.  Letter of Awards have been issued by IREDA to three successful bidders for setting up 8,737 MW capacity of fully-integrated solar PV manufacturing units. The government has plans to increase the allocation of the PLI scheme to Rs 24,000 crore.  As on November 30, 52 solar parks have been sanctioned with a cumulative capacity of 37.92 GW in 14 states. Solar power projects of an aggregate capacity of around 9.2 GW have already been commissioned in these parks.  Under the rooftop solar programme Phase-II, a total of 5.7 GW solar capacity has been set up as on November 30. Against the target of 4 GW for residential sector under Phase-II, allocation of 3.4 GW has already been made to various states/ UTs and 1.07 GW has been installed.  About 8,434 ckm (circuit kilometres) of intra-state transmission lines have been constructed and 15,268 MVA intra-state substations have been charged under the green energy corridor for evacuation of RE.  In his Independence Day speech this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission.  The goal is to make India a global hub for green hydrogen production and exports. The draft National Green Hydrogen Mission document is under inter-ministerial consultations.  Under the 12 GW grid-connected solar PV power projects by Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) with domestic cells and modules, the government has sanctioned around 8.2 GW projects as of November 30.",

The state's comprehensive EV Policy has been developed to fortify Maharashtra's position as the leading destination for EV manufacturing and utilisation. With standard operating procedures (SOPs), infrastructure mandates, and incentivization, we look forward to the widespread acceptance of EV's in the state,  state Tourism and Environment Minister Aaditya Uddhav Thackeray said after a meeting with Chalet Hotels. The aggressive implementation of the Policy is critical and cannot be fully successful without support from the private sector, the minister said in a statement. The minister on Monday met with Chalet Hotels which has committed to convert 100 per cent of its vehicular fleet to EVs by 2025, along with setting up of EV charging stations, across its portfolio hotels and commercial office spaces.  Chalet Hotels has done some good work, and I encourage more corporates from hospitality as well as other industries to come forward with necessary interventions,  Thackeray added. The primary objective of Maharashtra EV Policy 2021, which came into effect on July 23, is to accelerate the adoption of BEVs in the state so that they contribute to 10 per cent of new vehicles registrations by 2025.  The hospitality sector has a history of building environmental awareness amongst guests, whether through encouraging linen reuse, water recycling or saving, amongst others. Hoteliers are today, in a unique position to stand out in an untapped market of EV's by allowing guests to experience and potentially convert to them.  We look forward to ably supporting with the Maharashtra government on further initiatives in the larger sustainability framework,  Chalet Hotels Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Sethi added.",

The matching algorithm is designed to discover separate prices for both the RE and Conventional segment, thus offering an integrated contract to the participants, an official statement said.Transactions on the platform are executed in a sequential manner where RE orders will be cleared first, followed by merging of uncleared orders from the RE segment with other orders received in the conventional segment.  This provides an opportunity for both RE sellers and buyers to transact power under any segment and thus optimise their portfolio,  it said.\u201cI-DAS is yet another addition to our offerings intended to strengthen the power market ecosystem in the country. I-DAS provides an additional option to RE generators to sell power directly in the market thus creating a more robust market mechanism while ensuring better price discovery. The best part of I-DAS is that it enables obligated entities like Distribution licensees, Open Access consumers and Captive power consumers to meet RPO target by purchasing RE power throughout the year,\u201d Prabhajit Kumar Sarkar, MD & CEO, PXIL said.  I-DAS is expected to reduce curtailment of RE power and help unlock untapped RE potential while ensuring prompt payment to RE generators. It will also help in mitigating price risk of Discoms in purchasing power under long term PPA, thereby enabling portfolio optimisation for them. I-DAS will be the best facilitator for building a sustainable and energy efficient economy by providing price signals for capacity addition in RE segment, it said.The market structure proposed for operating Integrated Day Ahead Spot is:\u00b7Orders for RE and Conventional power to be placed during the same auction session\u00b7Matching of Order for transactions in RE in first matching\u00b7Uncleared Orders from RE segment to be merged with Orders received in Conventional segment\u00b7Exchange to submit single application to NLDC for scheduling RE and Conventional power\u00b7Buyer to receive RPO credit for RE energy procured in the RE session\u00b7RE Sellers (that are registered under REC mechanism) cleared in second matching are eligible to receive RECs",

        "articleBody": "Uttar Pradesh has fallen behind other power-intensive states in terms of delivering on renewable capacity targets and it needs to take urgent action to get back on track and avoid slowing down India's decarbonisation journey, says a report. A joint report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and energy think tank Ember also highlighted that the state is lagging behind in its 2022 solar capacity target of 10.7GW as compared to its peers.  Urgent action is needed to get back on track, not only for the state to meet its own targets but also to avoid slowing overall progress towards India's targets of 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by 2022 and 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, the report cautioned.  As of October 2021, Uttar Pradesh had a total installed renewable capacity of 4.3GW which is only 30 per cent of its 2022 renewable capacity commissioning target of 14.1GW, it stated.  In comparison, other states with high electricity demand are well ahead on their 2022 capacity commissioning targets. Gujarat and Rajasthan have achieved 85 per cent and 86 per cent, respectively, Tamil Nadu (72 per cent), Maharashtra (47 per cent), and Madhya Pradesh (45 per cent).  The report said Uttar Pradesh is lagging behind its peers on its 2022 solar capacity target of 10.7GW - the second largest solar target among all Indian states. Only about 2GW, or 19 per cent, of that target has been achieved, it stated.   Uttar Pradesh has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to rolling out solar capacity to meet its targets,  says report co-author Aditya Lolla, senior electricity policy analyst at Ember.  Uttar Pradesh accounts for a tenth of India's power demand - the second largest share after Maharashtra. Over the past decade, the state's electricity demand has increased by almost two-thirds and peak demand has more than doubled. And by 2030, electricity production is estimated to grow by 47 terawatt hours (TWh), it stated.   Until now, Uttar Pradesh has met most of its strong demand growth with coal capacity expansion. Going forward, solar can fulfil the vast majority of future electricity demand growth if the state achieves its 23.5GW by 2030 target,  says Lolla.   Hitting that target requires a major effort to ramp up solar capacity additions to around 2.5GW every year on an average.   Lolla and co-author Kashish Shah, IEEFA energy finance analyst, say Uttar Pradesh is now at a crossroads where the choices it makes about meeting future power demand growth could either speed up or slow down India's decarbonisation journey.  Meeting its 2030 solar target will allow Uttar Pradesh to avoid locking in resources to build new coal plants beyond those already under construction, said Shah.   Building new coal-fired power plants is becoming increasingly unviable,  he said.  Capital for coal power projects is drying up. Apart from state-owned non-banking financiers - Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) - there is no investor willing to finance coal projects in India, he noted.  In addition, coal power plant utilisation has been falling. The plant load factor of Uttar Pradesh's 23.7GW coal fleet has dropped from 68 per cent to 61 per cent in the last five years.   And heavy reliance on coal now leaves its power system vulnerable to any disruptions, even those caused outside the state. Coal shortages in India in October 2021 forced the state to purchase very expensive power at Rs 22/kWh in the open market,  the report said.  It highlights various barriers to solar uptake that need to be tackled urgently. These include the cancellation of renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) in recent years by state electricity distribution companies (discoms) and the discoms' increasingly high aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses of above 30 per cent.  Expensive and unreliable coal-fired generation has put tremendous pressure on the finances of discoms. In 2019-20 Uttar Pradesh discoms incurred a loss of Rs 4,917 crore (USD 660 million), despite tariff subsidies of Rs 10,120 crore (USD1.36 billion).",

        "articleBody": "Sugar mills and distilleries are likely to earn revenue of over Rs 18,000 crore in 2021-22 season by selling ethanol to oil marketing companies (OMC) for blending with petrol. In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Food and Consumer Affairs Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti informed that during the last three ethanol supply years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, the revenue of about Rs 8,079 crore, Rs 7,823 crore and Rs 13,598 crore, respectively, have been generated by sugar mills/distilleries from the sale of ethanol to OMCs. This has helped sugarcane mills in making timely payment of cane dues of farmers, she added.  lt is likely that more than Rs 18,000 crore revenue would be generated in current sugar season 2021-22,  Jyoti said. Ethanol supply year runs from November to October, while sugar marketing year from October to September.  In every sugar season, production of sugar is around 320-330 lakh tonnes as against the domestic consumption of 260-270 lakh tonnes, which results in huge carry over stock of sugar with mills.  This excess stock of 60 lakh tonnes leads to blockage of funds & affects the liquidity of sugar mills, resulting in accumulation of cane price arrears,  Jyoti said. The minister observed that diversion of excess sugar to ethanol would solve the problem of high inventories of sugar, improve the liquidity of mills thereby, helping in timely payment of cane dues of farmers.  In sugar season 2020-21, about 22 lakh tonnes of surplus sugar has been diverted to ethanol and about Rs 13,598 crore revenue has been generated by sugar mills from the sale of ethanol to OMCs. In sugar season 2021-22, it is likely that about 35 lakh tonnes of excess sugar would be diverted to ethanol,  Jyoti said. By 2025, the minister said the target is to divert 50 lakh tonnes of excess sugar to ethanol.",

        "articleBody": "India has recorded acquisitions of renewable energy projects worth USD 6 billion till October during the calendar year 2021, which is four times of the USD 1.5 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report.  Total value of acquisitions in India's renewable energy sector surged by more than 300 per cent to USD 6 billion in the first 10 months of 2021 (till October) from less than USD 1.5 billion reported in 2020,  according to the report released on Wednesday by the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) and the International Energy Agency (IEA).  It signals enhanced appetite from companies to invest in climate-friendly technologies, and opportunities for investors to book profits and re-invest proceeds in new projects, or even exit completely, according to the report.  The growth in acquisitions was supported by conducive global financial conditions and accommodative monetary policy maintained by the Reserve Bank of India. Adani Green's takeover of SB Energy India, in October, at a reported enterprise value of USD 3.5 billion was the biggest deal in the sector, it stated.  The report, titled 'Clean Energy Investment Trends 2021', highlighted that the solar photovoltaic capacity awarded in the first six months of 2021 fell sharply to just 2.6 gigawatts (GW) from 15.3 GW (including 1.6 GW solar-wind hybrid capacity) reported in the corresponding period of 2020.  This was largely a result of a backlog of unsigned power sales agreements (PSAs) amounting to around 20 GW with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) at the end of 2020, it stated.  CEEW-CEF Programme Lead Arjun Dutt said,  A healthy level of merger and acquisition (M&A) activities signals continued interest to invest in Indian renewables, facilitating the entry of financial investors and allowing developers to exit at attractive returns.   He, however, added that market uncertainty stemming from delays in signing power sales agreements, timely availability and pricing of modules and the persistent risk of retrospective contract renegotiations could prevent the flow of new investments from rising to a level consistent with India's 500 GW target.  Pablo Gonzalez, investment analyst, IEA, said:  Our analysis indicates that sectoral risks associated with the Indian market are higher compared to other large renewables markets.   Gonzalez, however, added that if challenges related to the reliability of power purchase and timely availability of land and transmission infrastructure can be addressed, financing costs could be considerably lowered, translating into even lower tariffs.  The report also highlighted that India's renewable energy sector will face headwinds in the near term. An increase in prices of PV modules, driven in turn by rising raw material and shipping costs, could result in lower realised returns than those priced into tariffs at the time of bidding.  Further, the central government's decision to levy basic customs duties of 40 per cent and 25 per cent on the import of solar modules and cells, respectively, from April 2022 is expected to increase module prices in the near term, as buyers advance their purchases to avoid the extra cost.  The report estimated that an increase of 20 per cent in realised module prices, from those assumed in the most competitive tariffs - Rs 1.99 per kilowatt-hour (discovered in December 2020) - could lower equity returns by around 45 per cent.",

But it amounts to 11-month of their billing. A latest status report of the power minister finalised on November 29, 2021 showed that the total overdue amount of discoms towards renewable energy (RE) producers stood at Rs 19,013 crore as on October 31, 2021, which constitutes 20 per cent of total amount of overdues of Rs 93,906 crore.The overdues of discoms towards RE producers stood at Rs 14,741 crore in January this year.The report showed that the amount of Rs 19,013 crore overdues toward RE producers was 11.8 times of their average monthly billing.Andhra Pradesh utilities owe the maximum amount of the overdues towards RE producers at Rs 6,279 crore followed by Tamil Nadu at Rs 3,215 crore and Telangana at Rs 2,159 crore.The minister explained,  They (RE producers) are very important in the context of COP26 (India's target of 500GW RE by 2030). No investment will come if they find that power is not paid for. That is compelling us to take more stringent actions to make sure that energy bills are paid. If we don't do that no investment will come for RE..then how would I achieve 500GW (RE by 2030) But I cannot have a rule for RE only. Thus, the power ministry is embarking upon a robust payment security mechanism for the power producers so that energy bills are paid well in time.",

        "articleBody": "A 'Mission 500GW' action plan will be drawn up soon by the government to take forward the announcement made by Prime Minister Modi at the COP26 climate conference at Glasgow last month.ET gathers that a joint committee of the ministry of power and ministry of new and renewable energy will soon be set up to draw a detailed action plan to take up India's renewable energy (RE) capacity to 500GW by 2030.Officials said that issues of transmission, the various types of technology to be used, the energy mix for the 500GW target and storage requirements will also be assessed by this panel. It will also look into the regulatory framework required for the scale-up of RE and to draw in the crucial foreign investment into the sector.India's current capacity is at just about 101 GW in 2021. This means another 400GW of RE by has to be added by 2030 to meet the commitment.Modi had announced India's intent to achieve 500GW of its installed capacity through non-fossil fuels and 50% of its energy requirement from renewables by 2030, at COP26. India had earlier expressed a 450GW RE ambition. With 50GW to add on, the 500GW mission is no mean target as RE capacity has to be raised by nearly 30-40GW per annum over the next nine years -- that is by 2030.India's current trajectory shows that it has added 8GW of RE per annum on an average except for 2020 when it added 12GW. A 40GW addition per annum, therefore, will be a tall order -- more so, given that this has to be done excluding the contribution from the large hydro power projects. So far, an ambiguity has been maintained on India's 450GW RE target, allowing elbow room for the country to keep to about 390GW of RE and add on 60GW of large hydro energy.The post COP26 commitment now will require a purely RE led 500GW drive, officials told ET. The committee will flesh out the mechanics for the same.The new matrix is expected to rely considerably on the Central Electricity Authority's Report on Optimal Generation Capacity Mix for 2029-30. This indicated that of the earlier 450GW Renewable energy target, 280GW would come from solar power and 140GW from wind energy. The remaining was to come from other hybrid energy sources. It is here that the proposed mix of hydrogen as well as biofuel may come in.",

        "articleBody": "India's third largest refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd said on Monday it has tied up with the country's nuclear research institute for an electrolyser technology for green hydrogen as it seeks to achieve net zero emissions by 2040.India, the world's third biggest greenhouse gas emitter, is aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2070 and wants to raise the share of renewables in its energy mix to 50% by 2030 from 38% currently.BPCL's Chairman A. K. Singh said the refiner plans to scale up indigenous alkaline electrolyser technology for use in refineries via collaboration with the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.An electrolyser splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. For green hydrogen, renewable energy is used for electrolysis. At present Indian companies import electrolyser plants.India's draft National Hydrogen Mission mandates that refiners and fertiliser producers should meet half of their hydrogen needs through green hydrogen by 2030. The federal government has provided financial support for setting up electrolysers in India.Companies, including Reliance Industries, Adani Group, Indian Oil Corp , NTPC and GAIL have announced plans to play a critical role in India's green hydrogen roadmap.Refineries use large quantities of hydrogen for de-sulfurisation to make petrol, diesel and other chemicals.Singh said BPCL aims to offset emissions from its crude refining and energy it uses by 2040, otherwise called Scope 1 and 2 emissions.The company has not yet decided on timeline to reduce emissions linked to the use of refined products such as gasoline sold at a fuel stations or jet fuel sold to airlines.BPCL plans to expand its renewable energy portfolio and would use green energy for its energy needs and expansion projects, Singh said.",

He launched the policy at the 'Round Table To Promote Electric Mobility' event organised by the Ministry of Heavy Industries.      The policy's main objective to launch the policy is to promote use of battery-driven vehicles and create jobs for the people of the state, Sawant said.      Speaking further on the benefits being provided under the policy, he said,  We are giving incentives on manufacturing, waiver of road tax up to five years applicable to all classes of e-vehicles registered in Goa.       The state government will also provide subsidy to the buyers of e-vehicles, and set up charging infrastructure.      Later speaking to PTI on the sidelines of the event, Sawant said there will be a charging infrastructure on every 25 kilometers on highways. In the city, the charging stations will be on shorter distances compared to the highways.      When asked about the details of the subsidy which would be provided under the policy, he said,  Our policy is for two-, three- and four-wheeler e-vehicles. 30 per cent for two-wheelers, 40 for three-wheelers and up to Rs 3 lakh for four wheelers.       It will be given to around 400 vehicles on first-come-first-serve basis, the state chief minister said.      The policy will lead to creation of 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state and the demand for e-vehicles will help attract investments in the state, he said.  He launched the policy in the presence of Minister of Heavy Industries Mahendra Nath Pandey, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, transport minister of various states and other government and industry officials.",

        "articleBody": "India can leapfrog traditional technologies - like it did with mobile devices over landlines and Aadhaar over physical identity for its citizens - with green tech to address the issue of climate change, said Nandan Nilekani, cofounder and non-executive chairman of Infosys on Friday.Nilekani was speaking virtually with Bharti Enterprises chairperson Sunil Bharti Mittal at the InFinity Forum, organised by Bloomberg and the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). He said in future energy will need to come from new tech and that countries like India that have not invested in legacy infrastructure will be able to leapfrog to make those investments in newer areas.  Countries that don't have a legacy of (investing in) technology for the last 30-40 years can leapfrog, and I think the same principle can be applied in (going) green. It requires good strategic planning, but I think we can get there,  Nilekani said, referring to India's example of mobile phones, digital banking accounts and Aadhaar. Mittal agreed with Nilekani, saying that the adoption of the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity to take banking to the unbanked has had a big effect, with Airtel Payments Bank being able to get 100 million registered users, with 40 million monthly active users, even without investing on physical infrastructure and not requiring citizens to go to a bank. He added that further advances in achieving India's net zero ambition will be driven by increased digital connectivity that will drive technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G, which will also help cut down on carbon emissions.Airtel's towers already function in a dynamic manner - powering off and on based on demand, he added.  The power of high-speed broadband connectivity will spin off a lot of benefits to the country and, of course, the world, and will contribute towards my making the world greener,  Mittal said.",

IREDA will also assist THDCIL in developing an action plan to create and acquire renewable energy projects for the next five years, the statement added.  Besides, IREDA will also extend its techno-commercial expertise to THDCIL for Environmental & Social (E&S) due diligence of RE projects as per internationally accepted standards.   This MoU will help THDCIL to accelerate their footprints in the Renewable Energy space, which already has a portfolio of Solar & Wind energy projects apart from Hydro and Thermal.   It will facilitate knowledge transfer, which will contribute to driving sustainable development of the country through Green Energy,  Pradip Kumar Das, Chairman & Managing Director, IREDA said.  Das further noted that  realising the vision of the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, to reduce carbon emissions to 45 per cent by 2030 in India, these collaborations will enable us to contribute to meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement. Also, these efforts can stimulate green investments and create lakhs of jobs.   This is the sixth MoU signed by IREDA within one year for providing its consultancy services for developers of RE and Energy transition.  Earlier, IREDA had signed MoUs with SJVN, NHPC, TANGEDCO, NEEPCO and BVFCL to extend its techno-financial expertise for Green Energy projects.",

        "articleBody": "The British government's development finance institution CDC is looking to pump in up to $3 billion in India over the next five years, its global chief executive Nick O'Donohoe told ET.A large part of this investment - in equity and debt across asset classes - will flow into projects that help tackle climate change issues, O'Donohoe said in an exclusive interaction.The investor is also likely to increase its exposure to early stage investing in the country, he added. Last week, CDC rechristened itself as British International Investment. Its total current portfolio value in India stands at over $2 billion.India has become a must-have market for most global investors. The never-seen-before liquidity rush into the Indian market, both through private and public market deals, is a testament to the growing importance of the country in the playbook of global investors.So far this year, private equity and venture capital funds have invested nearly $55 billion in Indian companies. We are looking at investing up to $1 billion in climate finance in India over the next five years. The capital will flow into climate mitigating projects and businesses to help the country get closer to its climate change targets,  O'Donohoe said. Over the last four years, CDC has invested over $1 billion in climate finance across Africa and South Asia.From starting a renewable energy platform - Ayana Renewable Power - in 2018 with $100 million in commitments, CDC has gone on to invest in companies such as agri-tech firm CropIn and water treatment and management company Roserve ($10 million).It has also extended debt funding of about $30 million to Tata Cleantech Capital, which in turn lends to businesses that focus on e-mobility solutions as well as water and energy efficiency across India.CDC Asia has closed over 20 commitments to a range of businesses and funds in India so far this year, including in Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF), Fourth Partner Energy and follow-on investments in e-grocer BigBasket, among other leading consumer brands.Apart from supporting companies directly, the development finance institution also invests as a limited partner, or LP, in India-focused early stage and growth stage VC and PE funds. It has backed funds such as Fearing Capital, Lighthouse Funds, Kotak PE, Aavishkaar and Lok Capital. At a time when early-stage investments are seeing an upsurge in the country, CDC is also ramping up its exposure to this asset class. For early stage, CDC invests in new age economy companies through venture capital funds.  CDC's Venture Capital programme has been active over the last 18 months. We have been increasingly backing more India-centric impact driven funds and will increase our pace of investment in this asset class going forward,  O'Donohoe said.According to him, the unprecedented flush of liquidity in the startup ecosystem stems from strong fundamental growth in the Indian economy.  We are believers in this growth story and will continue to back this with more investments going forward. In India, CDC's early-stage investments have come across VC funds such as Chiratae Ventures IV, Stellaris II, 3one4 III.  We also invested alongside our fund managers in companies such as Bizongo, Betterplace and Vayana Networks,  said Srini Nagarajan, managing director and head of Asia at CDC.",

The Ministry of Heavy Industries is organising this round table to promote electric vehicles (EVs).   Ministers of transport and chief secretaries/ senior officers from states, industry leaders from the automotive sector, start-ups and technical experts have been invited to participate,  the official said.  The round table is being organised to bring stakeholders together to work out strategies to promote the adoption of EVs in India and attract investment in the manufacturing of EVs, batteries and high-technology automotive components in India, the official added.  To give an impetus to the manufacturing and adoption of EVs and high-technology automotive, the ministry is executing three major schemes with a total outlay of Rs 54,038 crore.  These schemes are Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India II (FAME India II); National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell; and Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Automobile and Auto Components.  The FAME India II scheme is being implemented with an outlay of Rs 10,000 crore to incentivise demand for EVs by providing upfront subsidies and creating EV charging infrastructure.  One million electric two-wheelers, five lakh electric three-wheelers, 55,000 electric cars and 7,090 electric buses are to be supported under FAME II through subsidies.  The National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC), with an outlay of Rs 18,100 crore, aims at incentivising the setting up of manufacturing facilities in the country for 50 gigawatt-hour of ACC and 5 GWh of 'Niche' ACC.  A total investment of Rs 45,000 crore is envisaged under this scheme.   It will reduce the import bills of ACC by Rs 1,50,000 crore. Request for proposal (RFP) has been issued on October 22, 2021, for inviting proposals from domestic and international manufacturers for setting up manufacturing facilities for ACC Battery Storage in India,  the official added.",

        "articleBody": "Sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy and national hydrogen mission will be among the focus areas of the biennial Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS), which has already seen the state government signing MoUs with 20 companies worth Rs 25,000 crore, Gujarat Chief Secretary Pankaj Kumar said.Around 70 per cent of the memorandum of understandings (MoUs) signed with companies at the Summit get fructified over a period of time, Kumar said, describing it as a good success rate.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate on January 10 the three-day VGGS 2022 at Gandhinagar that seeks to attract investment in the state across sectors. The focus areas of VGGS 2022 would be key national initiatives and topics of global relevance that includes sustainable infrastructure and manufacturing, national hydrogen mission, renewable energy, electric mobility and futuristic technologies,  Kumar told PTI in an interview.He said the state government has already started signing MoUs with companies. Just in the last week itself, we have signed MoUs with 20 companies worth around Rs 25,000 crore. This is the first set of MoUs that we have signed. And on every Monday, till VGGS 2022 on January 10, we will have MoUs signed,  he stated.The prominent sectors from where companies would be participating in VGGS 2022 would be renewable energy, chemicals, food processing and financial services, he said. I can tell you around 70 per cent of the MoUs that are signed during VGGS get fructified. And that is a good success rate,  he stated. It (fructification) depends on the type of project. Some projects have very long gestation period. It may take many years. One has to see over a period of time. So this 70 per cent is generally the realisation that we achieve,  he mentioned.This -- 70 per cent realisation -- has been the experience when the MoUs of the last few VGGS were analysed, he stated.A total of 28,360 MoUs were signed during the last VGGS summit in 2019 while 25,578 MoUs were signed during VGGS 2017.The 10th edition of the VGGS would have the theme of  Atmanirbhar Gujarat to Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant Gujarat to Sel-reliant India) , he said. There will be a lot of companies from countries such as the USA, the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar which will be participating in VGGS 2022,  he stated.When asked how much employment has been generated by the VGGS, he stated:  As per the survey report of NSO, we have the lowest unemployment rate in India currently of 3.4 per cent. These are the latest figures. Vibrant Gujarat has been the most influencing factor in job creation. Due to this pace and type of industrialisation, both direct and indirect unemployment is generated, he said.Overall unemployment rate is the best indicator to judge or to evaluate the combined effect of government intervention in job creation, he stated.The first Vibrant Gujarat summit was organised in 2003, when Modi was the Gujarat chief minister. Last financial year 2020-21 was the year of the pandemic. In spite of that, 37 per cent of the total FDI across states in India came to Gujarat. In absolute numbers, it was USD 21.9 billion (one billion is equal to 100 crores),  he noted. The whole world is recovering from the pandemic. So, there should be an increase in FDI inflow in this financial year,  he added.",

The company also has $1 billion of debt, taking the enterprise value of the transaction to over $2 billion.While Azure Power and ReNew Power have held financing discussions with banks to raise money for a bid, Macquarie and KKRhave approached due diligence advisors ahead of a Christmas deadline for submission of non-binding offers for the company, these people said.The four possible contenders could be joined by two or three more competitors that could include Canada-based pension funds, these people said.Final bids for Sprng Energy will need to be submitted by March.Bank of America Merrill Lynch is the financial advisor to Actis on the sale of the company. A spokesperson for Actis declined to comment. Azure Power, ReNew Power, KKRand Macquarie did not comment. This is probably the largest cheque that one could have to write for a buyout of a renewable energy company in India so far,  an executive aware of the matter said.Potential contenders have also been speaking to local banks for refinancing a portion of the company's existing debt if they were to succeed in the bid.The company has plans to develop a portfolio of 9 GW of renewable energy, which predominantly comprises solar power generation, according to sources briefed on the matter.It has an operational power generation capacity of around 2 GW.Actis had invested $450 million to set up Sprng Energy in March 2017 with a plan to develop an India-focused renewable energy portfolio of assets.The UK-based private equity investor recently closed a $4.7 billion fund to invest in infrastructure.It has demonstrated a successful track record of investments in the renewable energy space in India. Prior to Sprng Energy, it had set up Ostro Energy, another renewable energy company, which it eventually sold to ReNew Power for an enterprise value of around $1.5 billion.Deals in the renewable energy space have been sporadic over the past year with fewer transactions having taken place compared to the deal frenzy witnessed earlier. However, two significant investments included one by Thailand's PTT Energy, which bought a 41% stake in Avaada Energy for $453 million in July, and Adani'spurchase of Softbank and Bharti'srenewable energy JV, SB Energy, for an enterprise value of $3.5 billion in May.",

        "articleBody": "The Indian Biogas Association has asked the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) to continue the waste-to-energy scheme through central financial assistance. Highlighting the challenges faced by the biogas, bio-CNG projects, Indian Biogas Association President A R Shukla said that a proper push is needed from the government by supporting projects with the Central Financial Assistance programme. With three distinct outputs of 'Biogas/CBG/bio-CNG projects/plants, they work as scientific waste treatment and pollution abatement plants, organic fertiliser production plants, and gaseous fuel generation plants. Unfortunately, the subsidy part is still not clear for the ongoing financial year, Shukla said.  If all of the country's biogas potential could be unlocked, the distinct output shall result from the annual production of 62 million metric tonnes of Bio-CNG along with 658 million tonnes of organic fertilizer. The direct impact would include a reduction in fossil fuel import (by around 35 percent of imported crude oil) and synthetic fertiliser import (roughly 27% of imported N, P, K fertilizers),  he further said. The government is targeting to facilitate the setting up of 5,000 plants by 2023. The projects can be fast-tracked if the state policy can further support the concept with ground-level implementation e.g., by allowing agricultural land to be used for the Bio-CNG plant, which is already the case with some states like Haryana, the IBA said. With Rs 20,000 crore subsidies, the government will be able to reduce the import bill in various fossil fuels and synthetic fertilizer imports worth Rs 1.1 lakh crore y-o-y, post the commissioning of these projects. As per the latest relevant notification dated February 28, 2020, in 2019-20, around Rs 478 crore for 257 MWeq was allocated under the CFA grants, IBA stated. Unambiguously, this allocated amount was way too less than the CFA/subsidy needed to achieve the envisaged target under the SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) initiative, it pointed out.",

        "articleBody": "The Glasgow Climate Pact has been reached after much struggle. Has it done enough to stabilise the climate in the near term and in a manner that addresses the climate emergency? The host UK may like to pat themselves on the back for some of its successes but it appears that it missed a large number of opportunities.Paris Rule Book: Tidying upFirst the positives. Two areas where the Glasgow Conference completed its work with reasonable degree of efficiency are the finalisation of the structure of carbon market mechanisms, and the completion of the residual transparency arrangements under the Paris Agreement.The issue of carbon markets under Art 6 of the Paris Agreement has been pending since Katowice COP in 2018. So, clinching it is certainly an achievement. Not that this makes everyone happy. Given the fact that a number of environmental and civil society groups look at the carbon markets unkindly, it is difficult to predict the degree of success of market mechanisms. Moreover, only lip service has been paid to the key concern of countries like India about transition of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects and Certified Emission reductions (CERs) from Kyoto Protocol into new Mechanisms. There are large costs associated with fresh approval and validation of the legacy projects that would be required for operating under the new market mechanisms. The issue of sharing the proceeds from trading of such emission unitsfor financing adaptation has also been left on weak wicket. There is no guarantee that the buyers will be willing to part with the proceeds for the sake of contribution to Adaptation Fund.The COP has been able to complete work on the reporting obligations under Art 13 transparency provisions of the Paris Rule book. These are fairly detailed and will make the task of biennial report of emissions inventory and actions fairly onerous. However,the good thing is that the flexibility provisions for developing countries in the manner and details of information to be supplied have remained intact. That gives countries like India that do not have a detailed national inventory system yet, some reprieve.2030 targets: Short shriftWith India\u2019s PM having made bold and ambitious announcements about enhanced and advanced energy transition goals along with a commitment to achieve net zero goal by 2070 (on the lines of US, China and other major G20 countries), there was an expectation that the CoP Presidency will train its sights on raising 2030 targets. It did succeed in highlighting the need of stabilising climate at or near 1.5 degree, but wasted the momentum by failing to convert it into specific and substantive questions of technology, capacity and equity.The CoP faltered in addressing the most important of its tasks \u2014 enhancing the NDCs to meet the goal of climate stabilisation at 1.5 or 2 degree. It simply deferred the challenge to the next year. The only thing it did was to recognise formally that there is need of reducing global emissions to the extent of 45% over 2010 by 2030. But, the CoP did not spelt out how it will be done.Phase out of coal: kite flyingInstead, the COP Presidency spent a lot of time and effort in coaxing a decision on coal phase-out which is not required as per the UNFCCC or the Paris Agreement. The UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement mandate countries to take ambitious NDCs; the nature and composition of NDCs is left to the countries concerned. Coal phase down is implicit in the overall clean energy transition of a country and its pace is subject to the kind of energy production and consumption reforms that the country is able to put in place. But the COP Presidency spent its capital in building opinion on elimination of coal from future energy options. Expectedly, it met strong resistance from major economies like China and India and the decision had to be watered down to accommodate their concerns.In the absence of a clear way forward on availability and utilisation of carbon budgets equitably, forcing a phase-out of specific energy source on those countries that have no access to alternative energy is impractical. Incidentally, the COP decision also includes a para on reducing methane emissions, based largely on the bilateral initiative of US and China. But, it did not evoke criticism or opposition the way the coal issue did because the share of methane in emissions profile of most countries including India is much smaller.Climate Finance: lost opportunityOne of the major disappointments has been the lack of any decision on predictable and scalable finance for meeting climate impacts and making transitions. Despite specific demand of India and African groups about commitments of $1.3 trillion for adaptation and mitigation, the COP has ended up simply by calling for efforts to double adaptation finance, mobilise $100 billion till 2027 and setting up a Committee to look for a new quantified finance goal beyond 2025. In a way, the ball has been kicked to the next global stock take.While India\u2019s PM took lead by setting up IRIS \u2013Infrastructure for Resilient Island States in form of technical and data support to SIDS, the demand of SIDS for a payment mechanisms or facility for meeting loss and damages was stonewalled by the developed country partners. The SIDS had to make do with a \u2018body\u2019 to provide technical assistance and a  dialogue  on loss and damage.Technology: the missing pieceThe COP has surprised most climate watchers by the fact that the decision text is almost completely silent on the future technology options. India\u2019s PM gave a cue by announcing the World One SUN One Grid (OWOSOG) from the platform of ISA but the Conference did not carry it forward. Absence of technology from the climate discourse is not a good sign. The project of global emissions reduction beyond 2030 cannot be run only on the strength of expensive technologies like carbon capture and storage. Innovation in new technologies like green hydrogen for energy generation and storage are key to low emission growth. The CoP should have actively promoted and financed global technology platforms of this nature at Glasgow.COP decisions never make everyone happy. Glasgow was no exception. Hopefully, the Egyptians who take over the mantle next year will use more of the civilizational and historical wisdom of Africa and Asia to take the unfinished Glasgow agenda forward.

        "articleBody": "The leaders of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, HSBC Holdings and Australia's Macquarie Group urged governments to get more involved in the green transition by providing incentives to develop new technology and help bring down costs. The trio were speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, days after the COP26 climate summit with a deal that for the first time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, concluded with a deal that for the first time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, though many delegations hoped to have achieved more.   The hardest move is that political first move because then you create the market conditions,  said HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn, pointing to risks that the private sector had no control over, including changing political landscapes. The CEO of financial conglomerate and the world's largest infrastructure investor Macquarie, which plans to step up green energy investments, urged governments to provide more incentives. Shemara Wikramanayake said governments can encourage private sector investments by supporting the process of funding and building new technology, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, and then exiting.   While there will be a lot of private financing and capital available, it cannot be done without public financing,  said Tata Sons Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran. Tata Sons is working with Macquarie on the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative in India in partnership with Bloomberg. Both Quinn and Wikramanayake highlighted that lowering costs of developing and running renewable energy won't take as much time as the development of solar and wind energy in the earlier phases of moving towards renewables.  The weight of the world is now behind this, wind and solar - you could argue - led the way and the weight of the world was not behind wind and solar, but there is so much momentum amongst the private sector and the public sector,  Quinn said.",

        "articleBody": "India will require a total investment of USD 10.1 trillion to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, while the nation could face a shortfall of USD 3.5 trillion, a study by CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) said. At the recently concluded COP26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India's aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.  India would need cumulative investments of USD 10.1 trillion to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, according to an independent study released today by the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF),  a statement said. According to the statement, these investments would help decarbonise India's power, industrial, and transport sectors. However, the first-of-its-kind study also estimated that India could face a significant investment shortfall of USD 3.5 trillion to achieve its net-zero target. Hence, investment support of USD 1.4 trillion, in the form of concessional finance, would be required from developed economies to mobilise foreign capital that bridges the gap, it suggested. The CEEW-CEF study -- Investment Sizing India's 2070 Net-Zero Target -- also highlighted that the majority of the investments would be needed to transform India's power sector. Such investments, totalling USD 8.4 trillion, will be required to significantly scale up generation from renewable energy and associated integration, distribution and transmission infrastructure, the statement said. Another USD 1.5 trillion will have to be invested in the industrial sector for setting up green hydrogen production capacity to advance the sector's decarbonisation, it added.  At COP26, India announced bold near-term and long-term climate targets. Our analysis finds that a transition to net-zero emissions would require mammoth investment support from developed countries.  Developed countries must ramp up hard targets for climate finance over the coming years. Also, on the domestic front, financial regulators like RBI and SEBI need to create an enabling ecosystem for financing India's transition to a green economy.  Finally, given the size of the investments required, private capital, from both domestic and international institutions, should form the bulk of investment, while public funds should play a catalytic role by de-risking investments in existing and emerging clean technologies,  Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, said. The study also pointed out that India's USD 1.4 trillion concessional finance requirement would not be uniformly spread across the five decades till 2070. The average annual concessional finance requirement would vary from USD 8 billion in the first decade to USD 42 billion in the fifth decade.  India's 2070 net-zero target is a bold commitment that would not only contribute to global decarbonisation efforts but would also shape how businesses and jobs of the future would look like.  Traditional domestic and foreign sources such as domestic banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and debt capital markets - both local and international - would not be able to fund the massive investments needed by themselves. Therefore, access to foreign capital on concessional terms would have to play a key role,  Vaibhav Pratap Singh, Programme Lead and lead author of the study, said. According to the study, India's total installed solar power capacity would need to increase to 5,630 gigawatts by 2070. The usage of coal, especially for power generation, would need to peak by 2040 and drop by 99 per cent between 2040 and 2060, it stated. Further, crude oil consumption across sectors would need to peak by 2050 and fall substantially by 90 per cent between 2050 and 2070. Green hydrogen could contribute 19 per cent of the total energy needs of the industrial sector, it added.",

Secretary (Power), secretary (MNRE) and representatives of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), PowerGrid, Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), and Border Roads Organisation were also present in the meeting.  Recollecting the announcement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to set up 7.5 GW of solar park in Ladakh (subsequently enhanced to 10 GW), the power minister sought the support of Ladakh's lieutenant governor to sort out the land issues in setting up of 10 GW of a renewable energy project in the Union Territory at identified areas of Pang.  The Ladakh administration assured to extend its support for providing land to set up 10 GW of RE project.  The required transmission system, along with the battery energy storage system, for providing round-the-clock power was also reviewed.  Informing about the outcome of the meeting, the ministry stated,  MNRE (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy) will send a team to Ladakh within a week to thrash out issues with the support of the UT administration.   It is decided that 20,000 acres of land at Pang will be provided immediately by the UT of Ladakh for setting up of a renewable energy park, while the availability of other 20,000 acres of land at Pang will be explored based on the inputs provided by SECI.  Ladakh will receive revenue per annum on account of leasing of the land allocated for the setting up of the renewable energy project.  The CPSEs under the power ministry will undertake corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities for the development of the region.  The 5-GW transmission link from Pang (Leh)-Kaithal (Haryana), along with 12 gigawatt-hour (GWh) of battery energy storage, will provide 76 per cent utilisation of transmission capacity.  It will evacuate 13 GW of renewable energy generation (9 GWp solar and 4 GW wind). Out of the 12 GWh battery energy storage, about 1- 2 GWh will be developed as part of the transmission element to keep the line charged during the period of no generation, while the remaining battery energy storage could be developed as part of the generation element.  PowerGrid will revise their DPR (detailed project report) to set up a 5-GW transmission link, including two GWh of battery energy storage and AC system strengthening in Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir, to provide RE within Ladakh and also to Jammu & Kashmir.  The MNRE will move a proposal for providing a central grant for the development of the above transmission link as part of the Green Energy Corridor.  The transmission link should be completed within five years.  Concluding the meeting, Singh reiterated the support of the Government of India for the development of Ladakh.",

According to the statement, the MoU was signed by Ajay Mathur, Director General, ISA and Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary, UNFCCC. As part of the agreement, the two institutions will jointly organise a set of activities with the UN Climate Change secretariat to facilitate the implementation of mitigation action in the energy sector, facilitate the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions and Long-term Low Emission Development Strategies. This will also lend support to developing country stakeholders, including SIDs and LDCs, in accelerating the adoption of policy options and approaches for decarbonisation technologies.  To act against the climate change and achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) relating emission reduction before the target date, can be made possible by deploying solar and clean energy.  UNFCCC has led from the front this climate challenge, and we are happy to partner, collaborate and endeavour to bring long-term, cost-effective and impactful solutions,  Mathur said. The ISA is an inter-governmental treaty-based international organisation with a global mandate to catalyse global solar growth by helping to reduce the cost of financing and technology for solar.",

        "articleSection": "Industry",
        "articleBody": "The latest draft of the COP26 climate summit deal, published on Friday morning, has ignited negotiations on the final scheduled day of the conference, where nearly 200 countries are attempting to clinch an agreement to avert disastrous global warming. Here's what the draft, drawn up by the British hosts of COP26 includes: NEW CLIMATE PLEDGES The COP26 summit aims to keep alive the 2015 Paris Agreement's aspirational target to cap global warming at 1.5C and avoid its most disastrous impacts. Countries' current pledges to cut emissions this decade would see warming spiral far beyond that limit, to 2.4C. To attempt to bridge the gap, the draft COP26 deal asks countries to upgrade their 2030 emissions-cutting plans by the end of 2022 - a faster timeframe than the U.N.'s current five-year review cycle. However, it couched that request in weaker language than a previous draft, and failed to offer the rolling annual review of climate pledges that some vulnerable countries have pushed for. The United States and European Union have both said they could support a faster review, but others say an annual ratchet would be a bureaucratic burden. The latest version said the upgrade of climate pledges should take into account  different national circumstances . That refers to the differences between rich and poor countries, and could placate developing countries that say the rich countries should cut emissions and quit fossil fuels fastest, since they are largely responsible for causing climate change. Government ministers will also meet every year to check in on efforts to raise pre-2030 ambitions, the draft says. MORE MONEYThe issue of finance is widely seen as the biggest obstacle to clinching a deal at COP26. Poorer countries say they cannot afford to cut emissions faster, or adapt to worsening climate-related disasters, unless richer countries give them more financial support. The draft deal said by 2025 rich countries should double their funding to help poor countries adapt to climate impacts, compared with current levels - a step forward from the previous draft, which did not set a date or a baseline. Currently, only a quarter of countries' climate finance goes on adaptation. But the proposal remained foggy on how to fix a long-held pledge for rich countries to give poorer countries $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 - a deadline they missed and now expect to meet in 2023. The draft COP26 deal expressed  deep regret  at the missed $100 billion target, but did not spell out a plan to make sure the money arrives. The draft also broached the contentious topic of compensation for the damages countries have suffered because of climate change. The draft deal would launch a new  facility  to address those damages, but it does not specify if this would include new funding. Vulnerable countries had specifically asked for a new loss and damage fund - a proposal resisted by the United States and other rich nations - and on Friday said they would fight for a more ambitious deal on loss and damage funding. FOSSIL FUELS The draft text took aim at the burning of coal, oil and gas, telling countries to phase out coal power and fossil fuel subsidies faster, although without setting a date to do so. That would mark the first time fossil fuels are named and shamed in the conclusions of a UN climate summit - a contentious move that Arab countries, many of which are big producers of oil and gas, had objected to in an earlier draft. The latest proposal qualified a previous draft by saying countries should phase out  unabated  coal power - the dirtiest form of power - and  inefficient  subsidies for all fossil fuels, meaning coal, oil and gas. Some campaigners said the new wording was a loophole to keep funding polluting projects, but other analysts said it would be difficult for countries to argue that fossil fuel projects - which cause huge costs in health and environmental impacts - are anything but  inefficient .",

        "articleBody": "India faces a difficult choice that will have consequences for the world.No country's energy needs are expected to grow faster in coming decades than India's. Even under the most optimistic projections, a part of the demand must be met by dirty coal power -- a key source of heat trapping carbon emissions.India can either compromise on development needed to lift millions from poverty, or it can continue burning coal from the country's vast domestic reserves, said India's top environmental official Rameshwar Prasad Gupta in New Delhi, the week before the United Nations climate summit at Glasgow, known as COP26.With just days remaining for the crucial talks, a fundamental question remains: Will there be enough ``carbon space'' in the atmosphere for India's developmental needs to coexist with the global ambition of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times.Last week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country would aim to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2070 -- two decades after the U.S., and at least 10 years later than China. But this will only shave off a tenth of a degree of the world's warming, said climate scientist Niklas Hohne, of the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Tracker.And India's short-term targets for 2030 -- increasing its current capacity of non-fossil fuel electricity to 500 gigawatts and using green energy to meet half of its needs, cutting carbon emissions by a billion tons compared with previous targets, and reducing the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% -- wouldn't have any impact, said Hohne.But experts said these goals are ambitious for India, considering its developmental status and will be far from easy.For instance, India will have to triple its non-fossil fuel capacity in less than a decade. And for that, its power sector will have to completely reimagine itself. States, whose entire economies have centered around coal for centuries, will have to diversify. Land, which is in short supply in the crowded subcontinent, will be required for sprawling solar parks.``It's a humongous task for a country like India,'' said Sandeep Pai, who studies energy security and climate change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D,C.Even then, it may not be enough for the world.Despite their ``net zero`` emissions targets, China, the United States and the European Union will take up 90% of the remaining carbon space to limit warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050, according to an analysis by the India think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) released Sunday. But if they were to advance their targets by a decade, more than 110 billion tons of carbon dioxide for developing nations _ or a third of the remaining carbon budget _ would be available for developing nations.``You can't develop, if you don't have the carbon space,'' said Arunabha Ghosh, CEEW's chief executive.And because of its vast population, India's energy choices have an oversized impact for the world. There are 27 million people without access to electricity. It has roads and homes to build, while extreme heat is driving up the demand for air conditioning. To fulfil these needs, India will need to build a power system the size of the entire European Union's.Although India accounts for the most annual emissions after China and the U.S., its negotiators in Glasgow have, time and again, pointed out that they have historically contributed a fraction of the world's emissions. Moreover, they say, the typical American uses 12 times more electricity than the average Indian.Indian environment and climate change minister Bhupender Yadav told the Associated Press in an interview Wednesday it's a matter of ``conscience`` and said those countries historically responsible for emissions need to keep their unfulfilled promise of providing climate finance.Modi said earlier at the summit that India expected the world's developed nations to make $1 trillion available as climate finance. As things stand right now, the climate finance from rich nations to align with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is ``nowhere to be seen,'' said Chirag Gajjar, a climate expert at the World Resources Institute.It's possible for the goal of 1.5 degrees and India's development needs to coexist, said climate scientist Hohne. What is key, he said, is not building any new coal-fired power plants anywhere in the world, including India, and shutting ``some coal-fired power plants'' before their time.A transition away from coal, especially for coal-dependent regions of the world, would require the assistance of the international community, Hohne added.Asked about coal, India environment minister Yadav said the country had no immediate plans to phase it out. ``All the issues come and get stuck in climate finance.''",

        "articleBody": "For the Glasgow climate summit to be judged a success, a key outcome had to be that parties agree the majority of the world's fossil fuel reserves need to be left in the ground.  As recent research suggests, 89 per cent of coal and 59 per cent of gas reserves need to stay in the ground if there's to be even a 50 per cent chance of global temperature rise staying under the crucial limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius this century.  The summit, COP26, has not lived up to that ambition because there are too many loopholes for the fossil fuel industry to exploit.  Some promising proposals have been put forward, including the pledge to cut methane emissions, some increased emissions reductions targets at the national level, limits to deforestation, and ending some overseas funding of fossil fuels. Yesterday, 13 countries launched a new alliance to end gas and oil production within their borders, led by Denmark and Costa Rica.  But most proposals suffer either from a lack of ambition or a lack of participation from key countries.  Take the pledge to cut methane emissions. Some of the biggest methane emitters such as Russia, China and Australia failed to sign up. Similarly, the plan to phase out coal allows some signatories such as Indonesia to keep building coal-fired power plants.  What these proposals and, indeed, the whole COP process, suffer from is an inability to address the fact that if we're to avoid the worst of climate change, we simply can't keep extracting fossil fuels.  While national governments and their negotiators remain willing to listen to the interests of fossil fuel lobbyists, the COP process will continue to be riddled with loopholes that will derail the achievement of real targets. Five big loopholes come to mind.  1. Subsidies and finance: Much has been made of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of financial institutions which aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy.  But many of its efforts will be undermined while governments continue to subsidise the fossil fuel industry. With fossil fuel subsidies globally running at USD 11 million every minute, GFANZ is insufficient to halt emissions because subsidising the cost of production and sale of fossil fuels continues to make the industry feasible.  Moreover GFANZ is voluntary, when we need commitments to be binding. It also includes banks who have recently provided USD 575 billion in fossil fuel finance to some of the world's biggest polluters.  Governments should not wait for future COPs to address this issue. Countries such as Australia should immediately start reining in the subsidies that make the industry profitable and should not entertain new subsidies, such as the National Party's proposal in Australia for a coal rail line to Gladstone.  2. New production: Despite the overwhelming evidence that most of the world's fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground, governments are still approving new projects. The UK government has 40 fossil fuel projects in the pipeline despite being host of COP26.  Australia, too, continues to approve new gas and coal developments. The NSW government has approved eight new projects since 2018, despite the state's target of 50 per cent emissions reduction by 2030.  Until future climate negotiations put a ban on new fossil fuel projects and agree to a clear and rapid phase out of current production levels, the fossil fuel industry will continue to thrive.  3. Business as usual: A further loophole for the fossil fuel industry is how it's being allowed to continue its huge levels of production because it has committed (in some cases) to making its operations greener.  Measures such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting have been touted by some governments as solutions to bringing the industry's emissions down. But these are not real solutions if they simply allow fossil fuel production and use to continue at dangerous levels.  While offsetting will have to play a role in reducing emissions in some hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and agriculture, it is not a substitute for genuine cuts to fossil fuel use and misleadingly gives the impression fossil fuel companies are going green.  4. Influence: These loopholes that allow fossil fuel production are, of course, no accident. The largest group of representatives at COP26 were from the fossil fuel industry.  One of the striking and disturbing characteristics of government approaches to climate change is the impact of fossil fuel companies on decision making. It's hard to think of other issues (smoking, peace negotiations) where we tolerate this kind of influence.  The industry's influence on successive Australian governments has been well documented, with over Australian dollars 136.8 million in donations recorded between 1999 and 2019.  Having a display by gas company Santos (a major donor to Australian political parties) at Australia's COP26 pavilion rightly provoked ridicule.  5. Decoupling production: The failure to address these loopholes will mean the production of fossil fuels in countries like Australia will continue for much longer than it should.  The fact there are still willing buyers for fossil fuel assets such as BHP's Queensland coal mines indicates investors are anticipating years of profits (and few climate liabilities) from fossil fuels, despite the measures proposed at COP26.  One of the most glaring failures of COP26 is the failure to connect emission cuts with production cuts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in countries such as Norway which have impressive domestic reduction targets (55 per cent by 2030) yet continue to champion fossil fuel production through oil and gas exploration.  A key to progress at future COPs and domestically is ending the false idea one can make progress on climate by cutting domestic emissions while simultaneously supporting fossil fuel production. If countries such as Australia and Norway can't come together to agree on cutting support for production, then we will continue to see loopholes that allow the industry to flourish.  Some countries are taking positive steps. The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance that aims to phase out production is key to cutting supply of fossil fuels.  Multilateral action such as this, whether as part of COP or outside it - and, crucially, the pressure from below that causes it - must be a focus if we're to avoid climate change.(Jeremy Moss is Professor of Political Philosophy, UNSW Melbourne.

        "articleBody": "Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday stressed on the use of ethanol in vehicles as a cost effective and pollution-free substitute to other fuels, and said flex-fuel engines will be made mandatory in the coming days.The flex-fuel, or flexible fuel, is an alternative fuel made with a combination gasoline, methanol or ethanol.Speaking at an event of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank here, Gadkari mentioned a Russian technology through which the calorific value of petrol and ethanol can be equalised.If this happens, all petrol pumps can be replaced with ethanol pumps, the road transport and highways minister said, referring to western Maharashtra which is a major sugarcane belt.Pointing out that there are already three ethanol pumps in Pune, the minister urged the state government to permit auto-rickshaws that run on 100 per cent ethanol in western Maharashtra.Notably, the central government on Wednesday hiked the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane for blending in petrol by up to Rs 1.47 per litre for 2021-22 marketing year starting December, as part of its target to achieve 20 per cent doping by 2025.A higher blending of ethanol in petrol will help cut India its oil import bill and also benefit sugarcane farmers as well as sugar mills.Referring to his recent meeting with representatives of vehicle manufacturers Kirloskar and Toyota, Gadkari said,  They have prepared cars with flex (flexible) engines. Flex engine means use of 100 per cent petrol or ethanol. This has been made on the Euro 6 norms. I am going to make flex engines mandatory. Speaking in a lighter vein, Gadkari said,  Don't use petrol...you don't have to hold agitations over rising fuel price...the price (of ethanol) will be Rs 62 and it will be an import substitute, cost-effective and pollution- free. Fuel prices have skyrocketed in the recent past, evoking strong reaction from the opposition parties.The minister also stressed on the use of technology in the cooperative sector, and said that financial and technical diversification in agriculture is very important.Emphasising on the use of green technology for vehicles, Gadkari said will be using a green hydrogen car in Delhi.If green hydrogen technology is used by the cooperative sector before the corporate sector, then the latter will reap benefits, the minister said.",

        "articleBody": "India has named its price in high-stakes climate talks: if the rich countries want it to cut planet-warming emissions, they need to come up with $1 trillion of public cash by the end of the decade.The demand comes after India\u2019s surprise announcement at the opening of COP26 negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland, that it would set an ambitious new goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2070. In his speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that rich countries should provide as much as $1 trillion in climate finance. On Wednesday, Indian officials clarified their demands. They want $1 trillion in funds just for India by 2030 \u2014 ten times more than the unmet $100 billion a year for all poor countries sought under previous deals. Over a decade, that would mean advanced economies have to give India the same amount of funds they\u2019ve promised for all poor countries.India is asking for such a large sum because it\u2019s also taking into account loss and damage, Environment Secretary Rameshwar Prasad Gupta said in an interview, referring to what poor countries see as a debt owed by nations who are responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere. Rich countries\u2019 current $100 billion a year target is only meant to fund decarbonization measures and infrastructure that helps protect against more extreme weather events. Even as 121 countries have submitted their official climate pledges to the UN in documents know as nationally determined contributions, India has held back. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d an unnamed delegate told the Hindustan Times, \u201cIndia will not update its NDC till there is clarity on climate finance.\u201d The Indians want a clear promise on making the funds available \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d an official told Bloomberg Green.India also pushed back on proposed language in the final Glasgow agreement that countries will \u201caccelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels.\u201d Gupta said the nation will only move away from the dirtiest fossil fuel if it gets the financial support it\u2019s asking for.U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said after a meeting with the Indian delegation in Glasgow that he \u201cwon\u2019t promise\u201d $1 trillion for India, and still needs to look at the details. In the meeting, Kerry committed the U.S. to joining the International Solar Alliance which is headquartered in the Indian city of Gurugram.",

        "articleBody": "Laurent Fabius, President of COP 21 and President of the Constitutional Council of France was on a whirlwind 24-hour visit to Glasgow, packed with meetings and interactions. \u201cIt has been hec\u00adtic and it reminds me of the Paris COP,\u201d said Fabius adding with characteristic understated humour \u201cwhich was not a total failure.\u201d During his day-long trip, the former French foreign minister met with people across the board. \u201cI met Prince Charles, Alok Sharma, John Kerry - the United States' special envoy to the COP - the Indian chief negotiator, Patricia Espinosa, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish Prime Minister, the Egyptian representative - Egypt will host the COP27-, my friend Manuel Pulgar Vidal and obviously the French delegation.\u201d\u201cIt is not because I am a giant or superman. I am no longer in-charge of anything, it is only because having been involved in Paris and being considered as father of that agreement that people are kind enough to ask my advice,\u201d said Fabius talking about his hectic schedule in Glasgow. \u201cBesides, I think you can say a lot of useless things in two hours and the other way around you can ask useful questions within 15 minutes,\u201d he added.The man who stewarded more than 190-odd countries to come to an agreement say he views the Glasgow COP as an important moment. \u201cParis Agreement was a landmark COP and the Glasgow COP must be an accelerator of action\u201d. Fabius says that the general feeling he is getting at the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow, the venue of the climate meet, is one of optimism. \u201cNegotiators and specialists are more optimistic or less pessimistic than they were a few days ago. It doesn\u2019t mean that problems are solved.\u201d He attributes to the surge of optimism to the announcements that leaders made during the first week and \u201cbecause most negotiators want an agreement\u201d. However, Fabius made it clear that the final word on whether a COP is a success or failure will be only evident at the end.The chair of the Paris climate summit said that there are three main issues and where the conference lands on these issues will determine whether the Glasgow COP is a success or not. \u201cThe first one, not easily understood by the general public, is the famous rule book\u201d. Fabius says that the moment you speak about the rule book and the Article 6 in the general public, people stop understanding what is being said. But for the former COP president this is a critical issue. \u201cIt is important, very important, and I will be personally very disappointed if we are not able to bring an agreement on that.\u201d The reason why it is critical, he said is because Paris was decided in 2015, now we are in 2021, six years later it is still not done. He acknowledges that the rulebook is \u201ctricky subject with many difficult aspects.\u201d All that notwithstanding, he said that the rulebook must be finalised as it \u201cnormal and fair to have rules in place\u201d six years later. \u201cOtherwise, people will say something was decided but even after six years things are not clear.\u201d The rulebook is critical to the implementing the Paris Agreement, as well as ensuring that countries are doing what they pledged to do.Second is \u201cfinance, finance, finance and it will be decisive\u201d. The basic elements of the problem, he said is that \u201cthe rich countries have promised not is Paris but in Copenhagen in 2009 which means 12 years ago, they have promised the famous $100billion a year and 12 years later we have not reached this figure.\u201d For Fabius, the inability of rich countries to meet this target is critical. \u201cIt is a fact but very difficult to accept. And when I say that I use diplomatic terms. Therefore, there is an absolute necessity to meet this goal. Am not sure it will be possible this year, unfortunately. I hope that it will be possible but it will mean that a new effort by rich countries.\u201dThe \u201cfather\u201d of the Paris Agreement flagged off finance as \u201cone of the most difficult issues\u201d. It is not just experience talking, it is evident to him in his conversations in Glasgow. \u201cEspecially when I was discussing with my Indian friends and some others, they insist on this and they are right. Because if you are poor country and you have no technology and finance then how can they cope.\u201dFabius hopes that the finance question will be resolved at Glasgow. However, being realistic he says that failing to meet the target in Glasgow, the \u201cminimum would be to fix the precise moment when this has to be fixed\u201d. At that he says is unlikely before the next meeting, COP27 in Egypt. Finance is not just about the total sum of money promised. It is, as Fabius said, about finance for adaptation and mitigation. \u201cthere is general demand for larger part for adaptation.\u201d There has been a steady demand to ensure that climate finance allocations are balanced between adaptation and mitigation. Thus far, mitigation or emission reductions have garnered the major share of climate finance\u2014only about 20 per cent of the money went to adaptation.Touching on another critical aspect, Fabius said, \u201cbecause adaptation is necessary, it is necessary to have larger parts for grants and not more loans as these countries are already in debt.\u201dFinance and all its elements, according to Fabius are \u201ctricky\u201d because if not handled properly it could present a big obstacle to success at Glasgow.The third priority is ambition. The Paris Agreement calls for limiting temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C with best efforts to restricting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. Fabius said he is \u201cpartly responsiblefor it. There were a lot of obstacles at the time, a lot of resistance including people who today claim it. I ended up refereeing and decided on the last night to put the 1.5 \u00b0C in the Agreement.\u201d\u201cThere is a problem of ambition because the IPCC and other scientific assessments make it clear if continue at current pace it will not be 1.5\u00b0C, 2\u00b0C, but more like 2.7\u00b0C.\u201d I know that new calculations because of the announcements it could be 1.9\u00b0C but the question of ambition is decisive.\u201dThe Paris Agreement in Article 4.11 calls on countries to raise their ambition through new commitments every five years. But it also says that countries can on a voluntary basis raise their ambition at any time. \u201cIf ambition is postponed for a far away date then it is not serious.\u201d At Glasgow, the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries that is the Least Developed Countries and Small Island States have already raised a demand asking countries to reassess their ambition annually. There is no mistaking the criticality of the near-term action and ambition of taking action on climate change for the former French foreign minister. The former COP president stressed that the question of ambition requires addressing the \u201cvery important question of transparency, accountability, and checking the results\u201d. Bringing to the fore once again why finalising the rulebook should be the top priority at Glasgow. In this context, Fabius is clear that the near-term targets are critical. Making a reference to Keynes\u2019, Fabius said \u201cIt is very important and it is good to deliver things for 2050, 2060, 2070 but in the long term we are all dead, therefore before going to 2070 you have to go through 2025, 2030.\u201dFabius\u2019 ordering of priorities\u2014rules for implementing the Paris Agreement, finance, and ambition gives a clue to his success in Paris. This is in stark contrast to the ordering of priorities as put forward by the UK COP26 presidency that put ambition first and the Paris rulebook last. The rules are critical for ensuring a sense of accountability and transparency for all aspects of the climate deal\u2014action (mitigation or emission reduction and adaptation or adjusting to the changes due to temperature rise). Finance is critical to implementing efforts to address climate change. The certainty of the rules and finance will provide the basis for countries taking more ambitious efforts to tackle climate change.As prepared to leave Glasgow after a day of hectic interactions, and remarking on the tough and hectic negotiations ahead, Fabius offered a warning to the COP26 President. \u201cIt has been hectic and it reminds me of the Paris COP which was not a total failure but I lost 7 kilos. And I said to Alok Sharma be careful because it will be the same.\u201d",

It is imperative that developed countries act decisively to deliver on their commitment to provide financial support - a pre-condition for climate action by the developing countries,  said Chandni Raina, Indian negotiator at the meeting.Providing developing countries with climate finance was part of the way in which developed countries met their historical responsibility for climate change, India said, adding it was disappointed with the talks at Glasgow when it came to the issue of finance.The issues that India raised in its interventions are in line with demands made by other developing countries. Stressing that climate finance must be in line with the Paris deal, India said resources provided by developed countries must be new and additional with emphasis on public finance, and not repurposed overseas development assistance. Also, funds should be equally available for mitigation and adaptation. Currently, a big share of climate finance is directed to actions focused on reducing emissions, with adaptation accounting for less than 20% of funds.",

        "articleBody": "India will easily achieve the target of 50 per cent share of energy from non-fossil fuels and also the 500-gigawatt (GW) renewable energy capacity before the deadline of 2030 set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh.  It assumes significance in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pledge at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow that India will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070.  Modi also raised the nationally determined contribution (NDC) target of non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, from 450 gigawatts earlier.  Talking to PTI, Singh said,  We are working hard towards the prime minister's target of 500 GW from renewable energy by 2030. We had said we will do 40 per cent (energy from non-fossil fuel) by 2030. We have reached 39 per cent. We will easily achieve the 50 per cent target by 2030. The prime minister has given the target till 2030, we will achieve...before that.   He added that the prime minister has increased the renewable energy (RE) target by 50 GW to 500 GW to be achieved by 2030.   We will achieve that. It is not too much, a tall order. Where am I? I am already at 200 GW (of RE).   I have established an RE capacity of 149 GW (including large hydro projects). I have 63 GW RE capacity under construction. So, I am already at 212 GW. So, getting to further let us say 300 GW by 2030 or in a decade, I don't think that is difficult,  he said.  About the mix of various sources in renewable energy target, India will have around 450 GW from solar and wind, while 70-100 GW will be from hydropower plants.  The minister said,  We have RPO (renewable purchase obligation) till 2022. Now, we will come out with RPO till 2030 keeping in view the 500 GW RE target. We are thinking that 70 GW to 100 GW will be from hydro and 450 GW will be solar and wind (under new RPO till 2030).   Under the renewable purchase obligation, consumers like discoms are mandated to purchase a certain proportion of power generated from clean energy sources like solar and wind.",

        "articleBody": "In its latest research report, the World Economic Forum has propagated that a Green New Deal for India could represent upwards of a $15 trillion economic opportunity by 2070 & that it has the potential to create more than 50 million net new jobs.In its report Mission 2070: A Green New Deal for a Net Zero India, the WEF in collaboration with Kearney and Observer Research Foundation has said that $1 trillion of the opportunity can materialise within this decade if 'concerted action' is put in place. In its white paper, the WEF argues that if the drivers and enablers of growth it outlines are kept in mind, India can leverage green growth to add $1 trillion to GDP by 2030 \u2013 and as much as $15 trillion by 2070.The paper notes that in India, the current per capita emissions are low even as its growing population, which is projected to surpass that of China's in 2025, is projected to contribute considerably greater towards emissions in the future. As per some projections, India's GDP may grow well above the world average between 2013 and 2040, at about 6.5% per annum. The paper says that energy consumption and emissions may see a spike if this growth is powered by an increased manufacturing base as well as higher demand in consumption. India has a once-in-a-generation chance to emerge as a global green innovation hub, given the nascent stages of the green industrial revolution. This may be achieved via incentives and R&D subsidies for the private sector along with the development of green tech business incubators and R&D centres, attracting innovative foreign businesses to establish or expand their presence in India.This, the paper says, might lead to the creation of jobs in high-growth sectors, and support for the emergence of a domestic market for low-carbon, high-value added products, and services. Transition to a low-carbon economy can foster material net job creation as it tends to be more capital- and labour-intensive compared with traditional fossil fuel energy developments, paper notes. Kearney estimates suggest that India\u2019s path towards a net-zero economy can create over 50 million jobs by 2070, with the largest source of employment creation coming from the transition to sustainable energy ecosystems.",

        "articleBody": "The US has partnered with the UK and India-led Green Grids Initiative of a global energy grid launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.At a meeting of the Steering Committee of the Green Grids Initiative \u2013 \u2018One Sun One World One Grid' (GGI-OSOWOG) earlier this week, US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said that the US is excited to be back in the climate conversation and to partner with the new initiative.\u201cAll the energy humanity uses in a year is equal to the energy that reaches the earth from the sun in a single hour,\u201d said Granholm.\u201cThe GGI-OSOWOG is focusing on the two most important pieces of the puzzle. We at the US Department of Energy are happy to be a partner with GGI-OSOWOG,\u201d she said.The International Solar Alliance (ISA) under India's presidency and the UK's COP26 Presidency had launched GGI-OSOWOG during the World Leaders' Summit of COP26 on Tuesday.The Steering Committee of GGI-OSOWOG comprises five members besides India and the UK \u2013 the US, Australia and France \u2013 and has been set up to deliver the vision of One Sun One World One Grid under which 80 countries have resolved to combine their efforts to create more interconnected grids, endorsing the \u2018One Sun Declaration'.Energy Secretary Granholm told the meeting this week that the US is focusing on next-generation technologies to ensure solar panels and grids are consistently efficient across markets and geographies.\u201cThe US is interested in helping countries that do not have access to electricity by leveraging the power of the sun,\u201d she said.Following the leader-level events of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow on Monday and Tuesday, each country's delegates and officials have been participating in a series of meetings to finalise the way forward to tackle climate change by the end of the summit on November 12.The Indian team includes Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupendra Yadav and chief negotiator Richa Sharma.\u201cWe must return to the sun to save the earth. As the world progresses to achieve new heights economically and socially, solar energy will power the transition,\u201d said Yadav.\u201cThe GGI-OSOWOG initiative has sustainable development and climate change mitigation at its core with focus on underserved areas. It will stimulate green investment and create millions of green jobs,\u201d he said.The One Sun Declaration for GGI-OSOWOG will be focused on building new transmission lines crossing frontiers and connecting different time zones, creating a global ecosystem of interconnected renewables that are shared for mutual benefit and global sustainability.This will be combined with expanded and modernised national and regional grids and complemented with the rapid scale-up of mini-grids and off-grid solar solutions.Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General of International Solar Alliance, said: \u201cThe success of the massive GGI-OSOWOG initiative depends on a country's own grid expansion plans, which would require investments\u201d.\u201cThe grid interconnections at intra and inter regional levels play a significant role to decarbonise our energy systems by using solar and other renewable energy sources placed in different time zones and amplifying that impact at large scale.\u201cWe look forward to a highly interconnected geo-economic future that assimilates large scale international networks and arrangements for a better and more resilient interconnected world that will keep more decisions locally empowered but at a global level,\u201d Mathur said.The World Bank has also expressed its support as it expects this initiative to help leverage the benefits of complementarity between renewable generators and non-centres across continents by getting them interconnected.\u201cThe OSOWOG initiative has the potential to integrate the global electricity system into one that is geared towards a higher share of variable renewable energy while reducing consumption of fossil fuel.\u201cThis will usher in a new era of harnessing a much higher share of renewable energy capitalising the energy transition that is taking place globally and helping build an ecosystem based on mutual trust and shared benefit,\u201d said Riccardo Puliti, Vice President for Infrastructure at the World Bank.The ISA, launched at COP21 in Paris and recently expanded to include all UN member states, aims to help mobilise USD 1 trillion of funding by 2030 to assist developing countries in expanding their solar power grids.The initiative is widely seen as a big and bold move in ISA's ongoing efforts to realise a global solar transition.The global grid concept was first announced by Prime Minister Modi in October 2018 during the first assembly of the ISA.In May 2021, the UK pledged technical, financial and research support for the OSOWOG project.",

        "articleBody": "Fitch Solutions on Thursday said the new climate targets announced at the COP26 summit by Prime minister Narendra Modi pose an upside risk to its outlook for renewable growth in the country. With the new targets, it expected to see attempts to alleviate the issues regarding supply chains, manufacturing and project development that have long plagued renewable proliferation.   The market's rapidly growing need for electricity will keep the market highly reliant on coal power, posing challenges to the country's decarbonisation plans,  it said.  Hydrogen will offer a unique pathway to decarbonisation in the power and wider energy sectors as the market seeks to cut one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.   At the 2021 Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, Modi outlined a net zero emissions target by 2070 for India.   As the fourth-largest carbon-emitting market globally, India has lagged behind much of the world's leading power markets including China and the US who have outlined a net zero target by 2060 and 2050 respectively,  Fitch Solutions said.  The new announcements put forth a clear ambition of the Modi government to tackle climate change more aggressively. India is targeting to increase its low-carbon power capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and meet 50 per cent of its total energy requirements by 2030.   We highlight that these pledges pose a mounting upside risk to our forecasted 313 GW of installed low carbon power capacity, including nuclear, hydro and non-hydropower renewables by 2030,  Fitch Solutios said.  It added that non-hydropower renewables will make up the vast majority, 83 per cent, of this growth highlighting the significance of the wind and solar sub-sectors.   We highlight that the market will not reach the Modi government's previous plans to develop 175 GW of renewables capacity by 2022 and will fall short with just 116 GW installed by end 2021.   We also highlight increased risks to the successful continuation of renewables auctions as well as the development of recently selected projects within those tenders,  it said.  Ongoing challenges, including project realisation risks, stemming from bureaucratic, financing and logistical delays and the country's underdeveloped and inefficient grid system, also underpin conservative outlook.   We have seen the government take steps to ease bottlenecks in the country's grid infrastructure, particularly in the integration of renewables generation. However, we are bearish on the prospects of this being sufficient to ensure the smooth integration of renewables capacity into the grid,  it said.  Ongoing China-India tensions will also cause increased supply-chain disruptions, project delays and reduce the viability of certain projects in the pipeline due to cost pressures. In July 2020, the Ministry of Power said it will impose restrictions on all imports of power equipment from China.  However, Chinese imports account for 80 per cent of the equipment and components in the Indian solar power sector. The safeguard duties on Chinese and Malaysian solar cell and module imports are set to end over 2021-2022.  Currently, India has manufacturing capabilities of 1.5 GW per year, which is set to expand to 3.5 GW in the coming year. Some estimates highlight that the potential for an additional 14 GW of production capacity could be forthcoming by 2022.   If the country is to increase its cumulative low carbon capacity from our forecasted 313 GW to 500 GW, significant increases in domestic manufacturing will need to occur or import regulations will need to be lifted,  Fitch said.  The market's rapidly growing need for electricity will keep the market highly reliant on coal power, posing challenges to the country's decarbonisation plans.   Fitch expected power demand in the country to grow strongly over the coming decade, in conjunction with robust macroeconomic and demographic fundamentals.  Economic growth will continue to be driven by the construction, manufacturing and services sectors over the coming quarters; these sectors are all large-scale consumers and will boost power demand. We also highlight the market's rapidly intensifying energy consumption per capita each year.",

        "articleBody": "With Prime Minister Narendra Modi having announced India's intent to achieve 500 GW of its capacity through non-fossil fuels and 50% of its energy requirement from renewables at COP26 by 2030, the countdown has begun on the ambitious target.Heads have begun to come together in the government to draw up a detailed action plan to take up the 450 GW plan up to 500 GW announced by Modi on Monday at COP26 as it is no mean target, officials said.India's renewable energy (RE) capacity is at just about 100 GW in 2021. This means, the country needs to add another 400 GW by 2030, officials said.Internal government assessments indicate that achieving the same would require India to up its RE capacity by near 40 GW per annum over the next eight years. As of now, India has on an average added 8GW of RE per annum except for 2020 when we added 12GW. Hence, a 40 GW addition per annum is tall order.  87498405Modelling studies have recently been initiated for the annual upgrade required.Another challenge that the 500 GW plan throws up is to achieve the same excluding the contribution of the large hydro power projects.So far, an ambiguity has been maintained on India's 450 GW RE target, allowing elbow room for India to keep to about 390 GW of RE and add on 60GW of large hydro energy.The new matrix - post the COP26 announcement - will require a purely RE-led drive, excluding large hydropower.ET gathers that the new matrix will rely considerably on the Central Electricity Authority's recent Report on Optimal Generation Capacity Mix for 2029-30.This indicated that of the 450 GW RE target, 280 GW would come from solar power, 140 GW from wind energy, and the remaining from other hybrid energy sources. It is here that the mix of hydrogen as well as biofuel may come in. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is confident that the new target can be met.Given that the RE missions have been so far driven mainly through private finance and the interest of the private sector continues to be buoyant, it is hoped that the new target will also elicit positive response, sources said.The other question before energy planners is of 50% energy sources from RE, as announced by the PM.India is aiming to have 40% of the total installed capacity by the year 2030 based on non-fossil fuel sources as submitted in Intended Nationally Determined Contributions.It is estimated that 44.7% of India's electricity demand can be met by non-fossil fuels by 2030. Taking this up to 50% would bring in hydro power and nuclear power to the mix as well.The only way to make this model sustainable, however, is to have discoms mandatorily buy up renewable energy generated, and big establishments use it up to a quantum.",

        "articleBody": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised many at the Glasgow climate summit by setting a 2070 net-zero goal for the country, but it\u2019s the ambitious targets that come before that date that may determine the nation\u2019s green success.In his speech, Modi offered five climate targets India would pursue, four of them set for the end of the decade. Here\u2019s a look at how they measure up to the country\u2019s 2015 goals:Half CleanThe most ambitious of the five targets is the country\u2019s aim to draw half of its energy requirement from renewable sources by 2030. Reaching that figure would mean a large enough expansion to replace coal for electricity, as well as petroleum fuels used in transport or cooking with renewable power. Coal, oil and natural gas account for 75% of energy use now.\u201cSourcing 50% of primary energy needs from renewables will be a tall order,\u201d said Debasish Mishra, a Mumbai-based partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. \u201cIt may be possible to reach that share in power generation with contributions from other non-fossil sources like hydropower and nuclear.\u201dRenewables Ramp-Up?India\u2019s target of reaching 500 gigawatts of installed power capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030 is little different from its existing goal of 450 gigawatts from renewable sources by the same year.87494945 The original renewables goal doesn\u2019t include large hydropower dams or nuclear plants, which would count toward non-fossil fuel sources. Those two already combine for 53 gigawatts, according to government data, with more projects already under construction.\u201cThe target to build 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 is a rehashing of the existing target,\u201d according to Shantanu Jaiswal, head of BloombergNEF in India. Emissions IntensityIndia will reduce emissions intensity per unit of GDP by 45% by the end of the decade, Modi said, after previously committing to reducing it by 33-35% from 2005 levels during the Paris summit. The country has made rapid progress in this area and policy makers have often spoken about surpassing the Paris target. The emissions intensity of India\u2019s economy has already come down by more than 24% from 2005 levels, former environment minister Prakash Javadekar said in June. 1 Billion TonsIndia will also cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1 billion tons from business as usual by the end of the decade, Modi said. He pointed to the country\u2019s massive railway network -- running mainly on diesel or coal-fired electricity -- planning to turn net zero by 2030, an exercise that will help bring down emissions by 60 million tons a year.To curb emissions, the country is planning to mandate the use of green hydrogen in industries, such as petroleum refineries and fertilizer, while the power ministry is putting together a plan to mandate a minimum use of green energy in other industries. India\u2019s Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in a Twitter post Tuesday that state-run refiners and fuel retailers have also embarked upon an ambitious plan to fast-track electric vehicle charging in fuel stations.Net Zero by 2070With India making the pledge to reach net zero by 2070, all of the world\u2019s biggest emitters have committed to become carbon neutral, even if Modi\u2019s surprise announcement came after months of resisting international pressure and asking for more recognition of its nearer-term achievements.Still, Modi reiterated the country\u2019s position that the developed world had failed to keep its promise of supplying enough climate finance to help developing economies make their clean energy transition. \u201cIndia managed to push back on demands to set an earlier net zero target and set itself a target it can achieve,\u201d Deloitte\u2019s Mishra said.

        "articleBody": "Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Tuesday that India's new target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030, announced at the 26th session of the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, is a  very significant  contribution to meeting the goals of the climate summit. The Prime Minister spoke at the summit of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. By all means, this is a very very significant contribution to the overall area of climate change and in meeting the goals of the summit, considering that India comprises one-sixth of humanity,  Shringla said in a briefing about India's National Statement at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow.Foreign Secretary also informed that PM Modi at COP 26 announced that by 2030, 50 per cent of India's energy needs would be met from renewable energy sources. In Paris, our nationally determined contribution said that 40 per cent of our installed electricity would come from non-fossil fuel energy sources. The PM today announced that by 2030, 50 per cent would be met with renewable energy. So that's a significant announcement again,  he said.The Prime Minister also stated that India will reduce its carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes from now until 2030, Foreign Secretary said. Again one of the Nationally Determined Contribution announced in Paris was the emissions intensity of our economy would be reduced between 33 and 35 per cent by 2030, this is over 2005 levels. The Prime Minister today said that this would be reduced by 45 per cent. And for the first time, India has spoken about net-zero by 2070,  he said.Shringla said that Prime Minister Modi delivered  a seminal statement  at the COP and highlighted the range and depth of climate actions taken by India along with future goals that the country has set for itself. The highlight of the day was the Prime Minister's National Statement on COP26. You would all agree this is a seminal statement. This is a very significant contribution by India towards global action on the climate change agenda,  Shringla said at a press briefing. It (speech by PM Modi) not only highlights the range and depth of climate actions taken by India but also future goals that India has set for herself,  he added.During his COP26 address on Monday, Prime Minister Modi announced five  amrit tatva  including the target to attain net-zero emissions by 2070. He stated that India is the only major economy that has worked and delivered on the Paris commitments both in letter and spirit.The high-level segment of COP26 is titled the World Leaders' Summit (WLS) and is being attended by heads of state or government of more than 120 countries.

        "articleBody": "Going into the Rome G20 Leaders Summit, India is the last man standing on a net zero commitment. Will India have joined the other 19 by the end of the summit on Sunday or do so at the World Leaders Summit that will flag off the Glasgow climate meet COP26 or will it remain resolute in its opposition to net zero emissions target? India should announce a net zero target \u2014 2060, as it should have done a while ago. However, having pushed back against a net zero target, India is caught between the proverbial rock and the hard place. To let go of its opposition and announce a target at this late hour, would seem like buckling under pressure. Yet to not set a target, would be to deny the direction of travel of the global economy.The \u201cnet zero\u201d target is much more than about greenhouse gas emissions. It is a political signal about the intent to move to an economy that is in sync with planetary boundaries. In the past two years since Ursula von der Layen, first as candidate and then European Commission President, put the this transition as front and centre of her agenda, the net zero emissions target has been a political signal heralding a radical transformation of the economy, and thereby the society. Other countries \u2014 major economies and developing countries alike \u2014 have followed the EU. India needs to approach the net zero question as more than a climate and emissions issue. It must approach it as a political one with immense economic and social implications. As a country that is yet to build out almost 75 per cent of its infrastructure including buildings, working to meet basic energy needs of its newly electrified people, building an economy that can bridge the serious developmental gaps, India understands the practical nature of the problem that climate change poses. Much of India\u2019s emissions (should it follow a fossil fuel-based, albeit efficient, plan) are yet to take place and as it grows, its emission profile will rise. At the same time, India is vulnerable to climate change impacts \u2014 the long coastline, the increasing incidence of cyclones on both coasts, the extreme flooding, increased fragility of the Himalayan and Western Ghats ecosystem to point a few obvious markers. India\u2019s plans for economic growth and development cannot be blind either to its capacity to tilt the emissions scale or the climate constrained world in which it must essay its economic growth.The past few years have demonstrated India\u2019s vulnerability to climate change. The first-ever scientific assessment on the impact of climate change on India, undertaken by the ministry of Earth Sciences, reported extensively on these vulnerabilities. What comes through is that climate change and its impacts cannot be ignored. That National Security Adviser Ajit Doval recently highlighted the security challenges that climate change poses is an indicator that the conversation is broadening.If India is serious about its plans to grow into a $5 trillion economy over the next few years, and then grow some more, it cannot afford to disregard the framework of sustainable and sustained growth that a net zero target provides.India\u2019s pathway to high economic growth and development must be fully cognizant of climate constraints. Unlike the United States, European Union, Japan and China, it is not looking to simply reduce its emissions to zero. It must grow faster and better with the smallest possible environmental footprint with the largest developmental outreach. A net zero target \u2014 one that is reasonable and yet not too far out in the future \u2014 is essential to send the right signals to investors, industry, and other stakeholders. Given its large population, the deepening climate crisis and its global aspirations, India\u2019s net zero target has to be more than the achievable or even a stretch. It has to be a moonshot. It must be a promise that pushes the whole of government and economy to undertake the radical reforms that are critical for India\u2019s economic breakthrough.At the same time, the questions of capacity, responsibility and equity must not be underestimated. Rather than push back, India must bring in considerations of equity to the net zero conversation by anchoring its target year in science. The IPCC\u2019s SR1.5 report calls for global net carbon neutrality between 2045-55 in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Global net zero greenhouse gas emissions follow. India must find its net zero target to be in sync with this global target. It must be able to rally the global effort in a manner that allows for a transition that is just, fair, and leaves no one behind.India is mindful of the need to work as a part of the global community to to make the global transition possible. Its national goals on renewable energy \u2014 450GW by 2030 \u2014 its championing of the International Solar Alliance, and the proposed One Sun, One World, One Grid that a network of interconnected regional grids to leverage the sun always shinning somewhere is reflective of this. The world too must grasp the challenge India faces in making the transition to a net zero world.A target, such as 2060, will give India a framework that will make possible the paradigm shift that is critical for a transition that is and leaves no one behind. Walking away from coal at this stage, despite the impressive renewable energy programme, will require reforms not just of the power sector but also fiscal \u2014 particularly taxation systems.At Rome and Glasgow, India can make begin this journey reminding the world that such radical changes must be anchored in fairness and equity, but most of all, that it takes a village to achieve a moonshot.",

        "articleBody": "India has proposed new rules to lower emissions and fight climate change, including setting a minimum share of renewable energy to be used by its industries, the federal power ministry said on Saturday. The proposals, aimed at promoting green Hydrogen as an alternative to the fossil fuels currently used by industries, will be made effective through amendments to India's 2001 Energy Conservation Act. The proposed amendments would facilitate the development of a carbon market in India and prescribe minimum consumption of renewable energy either as direct consumption or indirect use through grid, the power ministry said in a statement.  This will help in reduction of fossil fuel based energy consumption and carbon emission to the atmosphere.  The announcement comes just days after India rejected calls to announce a net zero carbon emissions target and said it was more important for the world to lay out a pathway to reduce such emissions and avert a dangerous rise in global temperatures. India, the world's third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States, is under pressure to announce plans to become carbon neutral by mid-century or thereabouts at next week's climate conference in Glasgow.",

        "articleBody": "India and Italy have agreed to explore development of green hydrogen, setting up renewable energy corridors, and joint projects in the natural gas sector as the two nations sought to strengthen partnership in energy transition. A joint statement, issued after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held the first in-person meeting with his Italian counterpart Mario Draghi on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rome, said the two leaders agreed to encourage joint investments of Indian and Italian companies in energy transition-related fields. They agreed to  initiate a dialogue to support the development and deployment of green hydrogen and related technologies in India  as well as to  consider working together to support a large size green corridor project in India to capitalize on India's target to produce and integrate 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030.  The two leaders also agreed to  encourage Italian and Indian companies to develop joint projects in natural gas sector, technological innovation for decarbonisation, smart cities and other specific domains (i.e.: electrification of urban public transport).  India set an ambitious target of building capacity to generate 450 gigawatts of electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind and more than double the share of natural gas in its energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030 as its transitions to a low carbon emitting economy.  It is also looking at scaling up hydrogen production from all sources, particularly green hydrogen as part of its energy transition pathway. The joint statement said a joint working Group established by the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the field of Energy, signed in Delhi on October 30, 2017, will be tasked to explore cooperation in areas such as smart cities; mobility, smart-grids.  The group will also explore cooperation in electricity distribution and storage solutions; gas transportation and promoting natural gas as a bridge fuel; integrated waste management (waste-to-wealth); and green energies (green hydrogen; CNG & LNG; bio-methane; bio-refinery; second-generation bio-ethanol; castor oil; bio-oil -waste to fuel). The two leaders also agreed to  share useful information and experiences especially in the field of policy and regulatory framework, including possible means to facilitate the transition to cleaner and commercially viable fuels/technologies, long-term grid planning, incentivizing schemes for renewables and efficiency measures, as well as with regard to financial instruments for accelerating clean energy transition.  They acknowledged significant progress in bilateral relations since the adoption of the Action Plan for an enhanced Partnership between India and Italy (2020-2024) on November 6, 2020.  They expressed their resolve to strengthen cooperation in the strategic sectors addressed by the Action Plan, including the cross-cutting issue of accelerating the clean energy transition to fight climate change, central to both the G20 Leaders Summit in Rome and the COP26 in Glasgow. They also recalled the India-EU Leaders' Meeting held in Porto on May 8, 2021, where the European Union and India highlighted the urgency of addressing the interdependent challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.  The two leaders agreed to deepen cooperation for accelerating the deployment of renewable energy, including deployment of innovative renewable technologies such as offshore wind energy and exploiting the potential of green hydrogen, promoting energy efficiency, developing smart grids and storage technologies, modernizing the electricity market.  In addition, both sides agreed on the utmost importance of cost-effective integration of a growing amount of renewable energy into their respective power systems, as a key asset for an effective clean transition that generates jobs, GDP growth, reinforces universal energy access while eradicating energy poverty,  it said.   In this perspective, the two Prime Ministers appreciated India's resolve to deploy 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 as well as Italy's prompt ratification and active support to the International Solar Alliance, and agreed to launch a bilateral strategic partnership in the domain of energy transition.  Such a partnership could build on existing bilateral mechanisms, including by giving new impetus to the cooperation on renewable energy and sustainable development between the Italian Ministry of Ecological Transition and its Indian counterparts, namely Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Ministry of Power and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, it added.",

        "articleBody": "The Ministry of Power has proposed amendments to Energy Conservation Act, 2001 which include provision for specifying minimum quantum of renewable energy in the overall consumption by establishments and industrial units. The amendments are aimed at promoting consumption of renewable energy.   Amidst the growing energy needs and changing global climate landscape, the Government of India has identified new areas to achieve higher levels of penetration of renewable energy by proposing certain amendments to Energy Conservation Act, 2001,  a power ministry statement said.  The objective will be to enhance demand for renewable energy at the end-use sectors such as industry, buildings, transport etc, it said.  The Ministry of Power has prepared amendments, after consultations with various stakeholders.  The proposal includes defining minimum share of renewable energy in the overall consumption by the industrial units or any establishment, it stated.  There will be provision to incentivise efforts on using clean energy sources by means of carbon saving certificate.  Power Minister R K Singh reviewed the proposed amendments recently and directed to seek comments and suggestions from concerned line ministries / departments and state governments.  Accordingly, a meeting was held by Alok Kumar, Secretary (Power) with the stakeholders ministries and organisations on October 28, 2021 to give a final shape to the proposed amendments in the EC Act.  To review the Act in detail, four stakeholder consultation meetings (one national consultation workshop and three regional consultations) were conducted with various stakeholders to discuss and receive inputs on the possible amendments.  Further, to the discussion and stakeholder consultations, the amendments have been proposed to strengthen the institutions originally envisaged under the Act.  The proposed amendments would facilitate development of carbon market in India and prescribe minimum consumption of renewable energy either as direct consumption or indirect use through grid. This will help in reduction of fossil fuel based energy consumption and carbon emission to the atmosphere.  India stands at the forefront of addressing the climate change and has committed to an ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of reducing emission intensity by 33-35 per cent in 2030 against the levels of 2005. The Ministry of Power highlighted that India is committed to achieve more than 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel energy resources by 2030.  Furthermore, by adopting energy efficiency measures, India holds a potential to reduce about 550 MtCO2 by 2030. The proposed changes to the EC Act will boost the adoption of clean technologies in various sectors of economy.  The provisions would facilitate promotion of green Hydrogen as an alternate to the existing fossil fuels used by the Industries.  The additional incentives in the form of carbon credits against deployment of clean technologies will result in private sector involvement in climate actions.  The proposal also includes expanding the scope of Act to include larger Residential buildings, with an aim to promote Sustainable Habitat.  The Ministry of Power has stated that the need for energy is inevitable and with the changing business landscape, it has become even more imperative to address the nation's need to become energy-efficient without putting further pressure on the environment.  With the amendment to EC Act, 2001, the focus is to empower institutions to contribute for Paris commitments and fully implement NDCs in a timely manner, it stated.",

        "articleBody": "In the runup to the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, everyone and their aide wants countries \u2014 particularly large developing countries such as India \u2014 to commit to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by a specific date. The European Union and the United States have promised carbon neutrality by 2050. China has given itself 10 years longer.In India, we view such pledges with the skepticism they deserve. Rather than pushing our leaders to issue a similarly bogus promise, rich countries should think harder about how to accelerate the changes we are prepared to make.It\u2019s important to remember that the targets issued by others aren\u2019t anywhere near as ambitious as they sound. The 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change argued that, if warming is to be limited to 1.5 degrees centigrade, the global economy would have to hit net zero by 2050.In reality, that would mean those places that can afford decarbonization \u2014 China and the West \u2014 would have to hit net zero much, much sooner. Expecting both rich and poor countries zero out their emissions at the same time would be unjust. Moreover, it is not going to happen \u2014 and the Western political leaders announcing far-off targets to satisfy activists know it.Second, those targets are scientifically unbelievable. They rely on the development of some sort of carbon capture technology in the distant future to make up for rich countries polluting today. Carbon capture on a planetary scale is fantastic \u2014 i.e., currently fantasy or, more accurately, science fiction. Anyone actually worried about warming would look instead at the total amount of carbon these economies intend to emit \u2014 the space under their emissions curves, not the date at which those curves go to zero.Policy makers know net-zero targets are meaningless. That\u2019s why even many countries that have committed to 2050 or 2060 goals are still quietly commissioning new coal plants or restarting old ones. Germany opened a new coal plant as late as last year and is still clearing populated land to dig new coal mines. Faced with high gas prices and an approaching winter, other European countries may also turn back to coal. Even COP26\u2019s British hosts, who have worked harder than most to remove coal from their generation mix, had to fire up old coal plants last month.China\u2019s target is even more farcical. After President Xi Jinping announced it last year, the first months of 2021 saw a flurry of announcements for new coal-fired power projects. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air estimates that \u201ca total of 18 new blast furnace projects with a total capacity of 35 million tonnes per year and 43 new coal-fired power plant units were announced\u201d in just the first six months of 2021.Perhaps the real question is: If net zero targets are in fact meaningless, why aren\u2019t more developing countries signing up? India\u2019s government in particular has had no problem setting various economic targets for the distant future that we don\u2019t ever seem likely to achieve.One answer is that developing countries have very few cards left to play in climate change negotiations and picking a net-zero target is one of them. The fact is, emerging economies such as India are willing to exit coal but can\u2019t do it alone. Whatever energy mix replaces coal \u2014 natural gas, renewables, nuclear power \u2014 the transition is going to cost money. We will need cash to retire coal capacity, to invest in renewables-friendly power grids, to compensate electricity distribution companies for the long-term power purchase agreements they have with coal plants, and much more.Multiple such proposals are on the table. The Asian Development Bank wants to set up a fund to buy coal plants in Southeast Asia. The South Africans are looking for help running down the debt of their coal-addicted, state-owned power company Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. so they can begin to invest in greener energy. Similar plans have worked in parts of the developed world. (Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has committed $500 million to launch Beyond Carbon, a campaign aimed at closing the remaining coal-powered plants in the U.S. by 2030.)We\u2019re accustomed to thinking of summits as successes if \u2014 as in Paris in 2015 \u2014 world leaders stand on a stage together and announce an \u201caccord,\u201d even if the agreement has no real significance. But a COP26 full of new pledges about the distant future would be a failure, not a success. I\u2019d much rather the conference end with no big headline but a few new mechanisms to funnel cash towards decarbonizing electricity and steel in the emerging world.If you want countries such as India to sign up even to empty targets, you have to offer something in return. Saying no to farcical net-zero targets is a sign of our commitment, not our indifference.",

        "articleBody": "Innovative financing can help India achieve its renewable energy goals, according to a study by Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). For India to reach its renewable energy goals, companies in the sector will need to fund capacity expansion with massive amounts of capital at competitive rates, IEEFA said in a statement.  A new report from the IEEFA looked at how this can be done by augmenting traditional financing structures and sources with other channels such as green bond issuances, asset monetisation and capital recycling initiatives.  The report examines in detail the positions and potential of three major players in India's renewable energy sector, each with ambitious clean energy plans -- NTPC, Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL) and Tata Power.   The capacity expansion plans of NTPC, Tata Power and AGEL will require major financing drives to keep on track to meet renewable energy goals,  author of the report and IEEFA energy finance analyst Shantanu Srivastava said.  The report compares the capital structure changes of the three companies, explains how they have funded capacity expansion in the past and identifies trends that will shape the major industry players' futures.  Overall, NTPC's government parentage makes it easier to tap a diverse set of investors, but its predominantly thermal power asset base is increasingly a hindrance in global capital markets, according to the report.  Meanwhile, AGEL, the largest solar power company in the world, has capitalised exceptionally well on its green profile, evident from its high market capitalisation, asset monetisation and bond lending program.  Tata Power, to its credit, has been able to pare down debt, which improves debt raising capability in the future, but the company lacks patient global pension/corporate capital on its books, said Srivastava.   A large proportion of India's renewable energy capacity will be added by the largest players already operating in the industry, given the capital-intensive nature of the business,  he said.  With a target of 450 gigawatts (GW) of installed renewable capacity by 2030, India has one of the largest renewable energy expansion plans globally and it will require enormous sums of capital.  Meanwhile, there is a flood of global capital vying for opportunities to invest in zero-emissions infrastructure assets, driven in part by the rise of sustainable finance and environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, it stated.   India presents attractive prospects for these investors to deploy capital and gain exposure to the country's growing renewable energy sector,  Srivastava said, adding  while also helping developers to secure low-cost capital from optimum sources.   To accelerate the financing of capacity expansion and attract global capital on the most advantageous terms, Srivastava said, Indian companies should continue to leverage the breadth of funding avenues available to them.  According to the report, to secure global capital companies will need to take steps like adopting green/sustainability bond frameworks, enhancing credit ratings of projects, adopting globally recognised ESG frameworks and principles, ringfencing renewable assets and creating a robust investor outreach program.  For conventional utilities such as NTPC and Tata Power this will mean delivering on commitments not to build new coal plants beyond current pipelines.  AGEL will need to convince its parent Adani Group that aligning with the Paris Agreement is a prerequisite to accessing the widening pool of global investors eager to deploy capital into India's energy transition, it added.

        "articleBody": "Green investment and sustainability are a priority in public policy, Union Minister of State for Environment Ashwini Kumar Choubey said on Wednesday. Speaking at a webinar on ASSOCHAM conference on Green Investment and Sustainability organised by the chamber, he highlighted various initiatives taken by the government to promote renewable energy, electric mobility, forestry, fiscal instrument design, and green growth plans.   Government schemes and policies such as Swachh Bharat mission, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Smart Cities, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana and Pradhan Mantri UjjwalaYojana, among others, are all contributing towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals.   Both central and state governments continue to maintain economic growth by introducing and implementing various policies and measures relating to sustainable development, climate change, energy efficiency and air pollution,  the minister said.  He said under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme, more than 8.5 crore gas connections were given to women of below poverty line families.   This has contributed to cleaner air and resulted in a drastic reduction of respiratory disease and untimely deaths as per recent medical reports,  he said.  Choubey said under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the nation has embarked on a path of climate policy initiatives and green recovery through a structured approach, planned investments to tackle climate change such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low-carbon transport are the foremost priorities and central to the development agenda.  Addressing the conference, Suvendhu J Sinha, Adviser (Infrastructure connectivity and Electric Mobility), NITI Aayog, said sustainability has become a common agenda and a common challenge for humanity.   It is no more confined to a particular country or group and has nothing to do with religion. It concerns the entire planet and must be addressed as such. Sustainability calls for a change in mindset, preferences, lifestyle, values and ethics.   Technological innovations will help us setting up new things and undoing the wrongs we might have committed,  he said.  Sinha said initiatives to increase awareness must be initiated and all these will require investments.   Our lending agencies must be encouraged to relook the priority portfolio of their lending and streamline the due diligence process for lending to the green sector,  he said.  He also stressed on the need for private sector to participate in a big way to ensue a sustained flow of fund to the lending institutions.  Bharat Lal, Additional Secretary and Mission Director, NJJM, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti said paucity of water should not become a limiting factor in our socio-economic development and quest for high economic growth.   The era of big dams is over because of environmental concerns. Existing dams and reservoirs need capacity enhancement so that they can store more water. There is a holistic management of water resources under the Ministry of Jal Shakti so that demand, supply, quality issues, among others, are handled at one place.   The Jal Jeevan mission was launched with the objective of achieving water security. The provision of tap water supply in rural areas has increased from 17 per cent in 2019 to 43 per cent at present and 90,000 to one lakh households per day are being given tap water connection under the mission,  he said.  According to World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF India) CEO Ravi Singh, WWF recognises that the ever growing human demand for resources is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on bio-diversity of our natural world.   We have seen a 68 per cent decline in the size of population of animal species, fish, reptiles and amphibians over the last 60 years. The issue of green, gases warming of the oceans, rising temperature of the earth are a global concern.   The Indian industry being an evolving and intelligent sector has also made efforts to address this concern through associations such as ASSOCHAM. India is estimated to contribute or require at least USD 2.5 trillion till 2030 as part of the country's nationally determined contribution,  he said.  He warned that the cost of climate emergency is going to be fairly high and India is one of those countries that will be affected by the over 2 degree Celsius rise in temperature.   India is already doing a lot in the area of MSME, in the areas of innovation and transition to different production methodologies which are environmentally friendly in the long run,  Singh said.  The conference deliberated upon pertinent topics such as regulation and policies, role of funding and finance institutions, alternative source of Green Finance and ESG investment, role and importance of private participation and challenges and opportunities in the green investment and sustainability.",

        "articleBody": "India will spend $316 billion (about Rs 23 lakh crore) in the decade to 2030 towards de-carbonisation, with a high proportion of the investment to be allocated to renewable sources of energy, a foreign brokerage said on Wednesday. The investment will be in addition to the estimated Rs 6 lakh crore or $84 billion already spent since the country joined the Paris climate accord in 2015, Bofa Securities said. Speaking to reporters ahead of the Glasgow summit, the brokerage's head of research Amish Shah said India has been one of the most active states on-ground action and pointed to the fast-paced migration to vehicular emission norms as a case in point. India is also right in not declaring a target for achieving carbon neutrality, as is being done by all the other major economies of the world, he added. Shah said he expects India to argue in favour of looking at carbon targets in the context of per-capita consumption rather than an overall perspective at the forthcoming meeting in Glasgow. The brokerage said investments of over Rs 14,051 lakh crore will be going towards a shift to renewable sources of energy, which will be followed by Rs 4,939 lakh crore of investments in rail freight capacity expansion and Rs 2,044 lakh crore in metro projects across many urban centres. According to its estimates, the de-carbonisation efforts will help India save over 106 GW of energy between 2015-2030, and cut carbon emissions by 1.1 billion tonnes by 2030. Shah said that when seen in the context of annual energy consumption of 150 GW per year, the energy-saving through the investments will be much more evident. He noted that India will not rapidly adopt nuclear energy as a substitute to power its economy, and the share of the source will be under 10 per cent in the overall energy mix. A bulk of the investments in this journey will be done by the private sector, Shah said, adding that nearly a fourth of the top 100 companies have already announced their intent to be carbon neutral even without a mandate on the same. Other areas that will witness investments include improvements in coal plant technology, shift from diesel to solar in irrigation pumps, rail electrification, increasing the share of natural gas and electric vehicle charging stations, as per the research.

        "articleBody": "For five decades, international environmental meetings have been riven by a north-south divide.While the rich nations of the global north have led calls to rein in emissions, their less affluent counterparts have largely remained on the sidelines. The Kyoto Protocol was in essence a treaty between the wealthy Group of Seven nations, the former Soviet Union, Australia and New Zealand. Even after the 2015 Paris Agreement brought developing countries into the greenhouse-target club for the first time, emissions from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fell 2.7% in the four years to 2019, while those from lower-income nations grew 7.2%.The words of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at a 1972 environmental conference have been crucial to fortifying that position. \u201cAre not poverty and need the greatest polluters?\u201d she argued.87299997By that logic, the preaching of richer countries reeks of hypocrisy. Having built their own wealth on the cheap energy provided by coal and oil, they\u2019d seek to deny the same benefits to other countries. With less than a sixth of the world\u2019s population, they\u2019ve racked up more than half of historical carbon emissions. Just as they monopolized the world\u2019s resources during their days as imperial overlords, so too have they monopolized the finite capacity of the planet to absorb carbon.Those debates are as alive now as they were back then. Major developing countries in September branded the European Union\u2019s plans to levy a price on the carbon content of imports \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d An equitable outcome wouldn\u2019t see India\u2019s emissions hitting zero until 2075, analysts at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi-based think-tank, wrote in September. Whether and when New Delhi announces a net zero target remains one of the biggest unknowns of the upcoming global climate conference.87300005It\u2019s time to recognize, however, that the logic underpinning this view is falling apart. When Gandhi spoke, fossil fuels were clearly the cheapest way to power economic development \u2014 but the price of rival technologies has been falling ever since, while the expenses of continuing an emissions-intensive path rise by the year.Solar modules in 1975 cost more than $100 per watt; the same amount of power can now be bought for around 20 cents. Even spending additional money to smooth out the peaks and troughs of demand when wind and solar aren\u2019t available now results in green grids with lower overall system costs than dirtier alternatives.India could provide 45% of its energy from wind and solar in 2030, compared with less than 10% in the grid at present, and still have electricity costs similar to its current fossil-dominated system, according to a March study by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Committing to generating 80% of power from renewables in 2040 would save $50 billion relative to a situation where they were absent, according to a separate analysis in Nature Communications last year.87300013In this new world, delaying the switch to zero-carbon power isn\u2019t giving emerging economies a chance to catch up with richer countries \u2014 it\u2019s retarding their development by saddling them with higher-cost power when cheaper alternatives are available.That\u2019s not to mention the expenses that aren\u2019t paid in dollars and cents. In India, multiple studies have shown that coal plants are responsible for more than 100,000 premature deaths a year due to the health effects of particulate emissions. An August report by economists at the Indian Statistical Institute put the cost of this, along with environmental impacts from mining and haze, at 0.9% of the country\u2019s gross national income.On top of that, there are less quantifiable expenditures due to health problems that don\u2019t result in death, plus the loss of competitiveness from cities so polluted that those who can afford to leave are increasingly doing so. Yet the longer-term effects of climate change itself are most severe of all. One 2018 study put the weakening of annual gross domestic product growth in India at 6.4 percentage points if the Earth\u2019s temperature increases by 2 degrees Celsius, among the worst in the world after nations in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.Rich countries shouldn\u2019t take this as a reason to avoid their own difficult choices. As much as developing economies may want to decarbonize, they\u2019re still held back by the scanty availability of cash to build new power plants. The majority of the cost of running a fossil-fired generator is incurred in buying fuel over the course of its operating life, but almost all of the expense for wind or solar comes at the construction stage. That gives a lingering advantage to coal and gas because rich nations historically have been reluctant to extend the sort of up-front, long-term lending to emerging markets that renewable projects need.If financial engineering had been moving at the same speed as mechanical engineering over the past decade, the trillions of investment dollars stuck with low returns in developed markets would be seeking out opportunities in regions where power consumption is set to surge over the coming decades. Unfortunately, the backsliding on that front is still ongoing. A blueprint for a $100 billion-a-year climate fund for emerging economies released this week still fell short of sums first pledged at the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference.The challenge for both sides is to look beyond their pasts and glimpse the scale of opportunity ahead. India has one of the lowest rates of emissions per person of any major economy. It now has a chance to do something no comparable country has achieved before: growing affluent using cheaper, greener power that didn\u2019t exist until a few years ago, rather than at the cost of its citizens\u2019 health and a despoiled environment.What emerging economies do now on the energy transition should be measured not by the small scale of their historic blame, but the immense scale of their future opportunity. Indira Gandhi warned of a developing world polluted by its poverty. The far greater risk is that nations will instead be impoverished by their pollution.",

        "articleBody": "India-Sweden cooperation in the energy sector will go a long way in achieving the goal of fossil fuel free economy, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday and underlined that India is looking for technology solutions for clean energy.Delivering the inaugural address at the 8th India-Sweden Innovation Day meet on the theme 'Accelerating India Sweden Green Transition', he also said a new joint call on circular economy, including health science and waste to wealth, was made by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Swedish Vinnova during 2021-2022.Singh said that cooperation in the energy sector was identified as an important area during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Stockholm in April 2018 as India is looking for technology solutions for clean energy.He noted that the DST and the Swedish Energy Agency have worked out and launched a call for industrial research and development proposals in this sector, and received 20 joint industry led proposals, which are in an advanced stage of consideration. We may implement shortlisted projects soon,  the minister of state (independent charge) of the ministry of science and technology and earth sciences said.Singh said that following the visit of Prime Minister Modi, the scientific cooperation was reviewed at the official level by a joint committee.It identified several important themes for science and technology cooperation such as smart cities, clean technologies, digitalisation, including \u2018Internet of Things', machine learning, circular economy, Singh said.The DST and the Swedish Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation are implementing these, he said.The joint call was made by the prime ministers of both countries during their bilateral meeting on March 5, 2021, which resulted in 22 projects and three joint projects being recommended from both sides for funding, the minister said.Singh said a new joint call on circular economy, including health science and waste to wealth, was made by the DST, the DBT and Swedish Vinnova during 2021-2022.He said the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Swedish FORTE have also agreed to launch the new call in 2021-2022 on broad themes like public health, prevention, and health promotion and provision of care for the elderly.In addition, the DBT is already engaged with Swedish partners on incubator connect, digital health care and global bio India programmes, enhancing the partnerships in the field of biotechnology.In his address, Ibrahim Baylan, Swedish Minister for Business, Industry and Innovation, said that Indo-Swedish cooperation continued even during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic.He said that the number of scientific collaborations has increased since 2018 and called for finding new solutions, new resilience for developing a sustainable society. Baylan said Sweden is working hard on becoming a fossil fuel free economy and developing new climate neutral technology products.",

        "articleBody": "Singapore plans to launch standardised guidelines for renewable energy certificates, part of efforts to decarbonise its power sector and develop a regional grid, a minister said on Tuesday. The certificates, called RECs, are market-based instruments substantiating that electricity has been generated from renewable energy sources. One certificate represents that one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated from a renewable energy source and delivered to the grid.  These guidelines will help support renewable energy deployment in Singapore and in the region, supporting the development of a regional grid that taps different types of low carbon energy sources in the region,  Tan See Leng, the minister for manpower and second minister for trade and industry said at the Asian Clean Energy Summit. Tan said the guidelines were the first of their kind in Southeast Asia and define the types of renewable energy sources - such as solar, wind and biomass - that are eligible to generate RECs.  The growth of a regional grid presents opportunities across the renewable energy value chain, and can leverage our current renewable energy ecosystem,  said Tan. ",

        "articleBody": "Batting for green hydrogen as a transport fuel, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday said there is a need to make India a country that will not be dependent on imports of petrol and diesel. Speaking at an event, Gadkari regretted that some countries are also using proceeds from the sale of petrol and diesel to finance terrorism.  Green hydrogen is better than petrol and diesel. The transport sector is witnessing a big change.  We want to make a country which will not be dependent upon the import of petrol and diesel but will export fuel,  the road transport and highways minister said, adding that this was a nationalistic view. By importing petrol and diesel, Gadkari, who is known for his frank views, said,  We are making countries richer which also finance terrorism . The road transport and highways minister, however, did not name any country. He further said the reduction of import of petrol and diesel can solve a lot of problems being faced by the country. Gadkari said it is unfortunate that India has to import aluminium and copper even though the country has an abundance of these metals.  Economy and environment are important... there is a need to protect environment and ecology, but development and infrastructure work should not be stopped,  he emphasised. Referring to the issue of recent power shortages in some parts of the country, he said the situation of state-run Discoms are very bad. He noted that in the near future, India would need more power as there is a probability that the economic growth of the country will accelerate.  So, probably in December, January, February, March, April and May, we may face the problem of power shortage.  We were surplus in power, now we are facing power shortage,  he said.",

Large industries can go green. Our efforts have been to make doing the business simpler and GDAM (green day ahead market) is a step in this direction,\u201d he said.The market-based competitive prices will provide another option to renewable generators to sell power as well as accelerate the renewable capacity addition towards the government\u2019s vision of building India as a sustainable and efficient energy economy, Indian Energy Exchange chairman S N Goel said.Power secretary Alok Kumar said the green day ahead market would help green projects facing curtailment, unlocking untapped renewable energy potential and ensuring instant payment to renewable energy generators. The Green Day-ahead market will operate in an integrated way with the conventional day-ahead market. IEX will offer the market participants to submit bids together for both conventional and renewable energy through the separate bidding windows.The clearance will take place in a sequential manner - renewable energy bids will be cleared first in accordance with the must-run status of the renewables, followed by conventional segment. This mechanism will allow renewable energy sellers to subsequently bid in the conventional segment should their bids remain uncleared in the green market. There will be separate price discoveries for both the conventional and renewables, an official statement said.PXIL managing director Prabhajit Kumar Sarkar said, \u201cESCerts trading will take forward and diversify amongst participants the benefits of the PAT Cycle-II, which has reportedly prompted savings of 13.28 million toe of energy for the country resulting in absolute saving of more than Rs. 30,000 crore for sustainable growth of the country.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "Amid Covid-19 pandemic, renewable energy employment worldwide reached 12 million last year, up from 11.5 million in 2019, according to the eighth edition of Renewable Energy and Jobs: Annual Review 2021.The report was released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in collaboration with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) at a high-level opening of IRENA's collaborative framework on Just and Inclusive Transitions, co-facilitated by the US and South Africa.The report confirms that the pandemic caused delays and supply chain disruptions with impacts on jobs varying by country and end use, and among segments of the value chain.While solar and wind jobs continued leading global employment growth in the renewable energy sector, accounting for a total of 4 million and 1.25 million jobs respectively, liquid biofuels employment decreased as demand for transport fuels fell.Off-grid solar lighting sales suffered, but companies were able to limit job losses.China commanded a 39 per cent share of renewable energy jobs worldwide in 2020, followed by Brazil, India, the US, and members of the European Union. Many other countries are also creating jobs in renewables.Among them are Vietnam and Malaysia, key solar PV exporters; Indonesia and Colombia, with large agricultural supply chains for biofuels; and Mexico and the Russian Federation, where wind power is growing.In Sub-Saharan Africa, solar jobs are expanding in diverse countries like Nigeria, Togo, and South Africa. Renewable energy's ability to create jobs and meet climate goals is beyond doubt. With COP26 in front of us, governments must raise their ambition to reach net zero,  says Francesco La Camera, IRENA Director-General. The only path forward is to increase investments in a just and inclusive transition, reaping the full socioeconomic benefits along the way.  The potential for renewable energy to generate decent work is a clear indication that we do not have to choose between environmental sustainability on the one hand, and employment creation on the other. The two can go hand-in-hand,  said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder.Recognising that women suffered more from the pandemic because they tend to work in sectors more vulnerable to economic shocks, the report highlights the importance of a just transition and decent jobs for all, ensuring that jobs pay a living wage, workplaces are safe, and rights at work are respected.A just transition requires a workforce that is diverse -- with equal chances for women and men, and with career paths open to youth, minorities, and marginalised groups.International labour standards and collective bargaining arrangements are crucial in this context.Fulfilling the renewable energy jobs potential will depend on ambitious policies to drive the energy transition in coming decades. In addition to deployment, enabling, and integrating policies for the sector itself, there is a need to overcome structural barriers in the wider economy and minimise potential misalignments between job losses and gains during the transition.Indeed, IRENA and ILO's work finds that more jobs will be gained by the energy transition than lost. An ILO global sustainability scenario to 2030 estimates that the 24-25 million new jobs will far surpass losses of between six and seven million jobs.Some five million of the workers who lose their jobs will be able to find new jobs in the same occupation in another industry.IRENA's World Energy Transitions Outlook forecasts that the renewable energy sector could employ 43 million by 2050.The disruption to cross-border supplies caused by Covid-19 restrictions has highlighted the important role of domestic value chains.Strengthening them will facilitate local job creation and income generation, by leveraging existing and new economic activities.",

        "articleBody": "Investing in clean energy can help economies recover from the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as it will add more jobs than backing fossil fuels, researchers said on Monday.  Green investments can be an important part of recovery packages, lead to job creation and positive economic outcomes, and help address climate change,  said a report from the World Resources Institute (WRI), a U.S.-based think-tank. Yet in a bid to spur growth after millions lost work during coronavirus lockdowns worldwide, governments are spending more on carbon-heavy industries that neither address climate change concerns nor offer stability to workers, it warned. Analysing more than a dozen studies conducted over the past decade, the WRI report projected that $1 million in green investments would create more near-term jobs than the same amount invested in roads and fossil fuels. But the quality of jobs created in climate-positive sectors must be protected by ensuring fair wages and working conditions, the report stated, calling on governments to engage with labour unions and employers on the issue. As the world grapples with rising heat and more extreme weather, as well as an employment squeeze, going green offers the chance to tackle both problems at once, researchers said.  Investing in climate is not a cost but an economic opportunity,  Joel Jaeger, lead author of the WRI report, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The pandemic wiped out about 255 million full-time jobs last year and workers globally lost income totalling about $3.7 trillion, according to the International Labour Organization. But stimulus packages to revive pandemic-hit sectors tell a story of green indifference, the WRI report noted. Industries reliant on fossil fuels have garnered $334 billion in government investment compared to $276 billion for renewable energy and public transport, according to data from Energy Policy Tracker cited in the report. It estimated that Indonesia could add 15.3 million jobs by 2045 and the United States could add 4.5 million jobs per year over 10 years if those countries invested in clean energy and adopted low-carbon growth strategies. PANDEMIC GAINSClimate-friendly industries have already offered work and better wages during the pandemic, the report added. For example, electric-vehicle manufacturing in China has attracted people due to higher pay, and in Pakistan, a state investment of $135 million in tree planting and forest protection created 85,000 daily wage jobs in the last year. More broadly, investing in solar-photovoltaic equipment manufacturing creates 1.5 times as many jobs as the same amount spent on fossil fuel production, while for wind power the figure is 1.2 times, showed the studies analysed by WRI. The renewable energy sector has created a rising number of jobs in recent years, at 11.5 million in 2019 up from 11 million the previous year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, which promotes clean energy and technologies. Installing solar panels or retrofitting a building to make it more energy efficient are labour-intensive activities that have the potential to create more jobs, researcher Jaeger said. Communities and workers dependent on fossil fuels should be re-trained and offered alternative ways to make a living as the world shifts to clean energy while ensuring the quality of jobs created in renewable energy, the report urged.  We need to avoid a race to the bottom where the falling costs of green technologies are achieved by cutting wages, job security or working conditions,  the report said. 'WINNERS AND LOSERS'Backers say the shift from coal, gas and oil to green energy will create millions of new jobs, making up for those lost in dirty sectors. But the transition faces political hurdles as well as opposition from people whose livelihoods depend on fossil-fuel mining and extraction. Researchers studying coal-dependent communities globally warned the change would be neither quick nor easy.  More and more studies show there will be more jobs in renewable and clean energy - but they won't go to the same people who will lose jobs in fossil fuels,  said Sandeep Pai of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. The new jobs will not necessarily be created in the same geographic locations and some of them - such as manufacturing solar panels - may not provide high-skilled, permanent work.  As countries decarbonise, there will be winners - more jobs for people, healthier air and water - but (the) losers will be huge,  said Pai, calling for an immediate start to efforts to diversify the economies of coal-rich regions.

        "articleBody": "Concrete has been the world's main construction material for decades, used in everything from rebuilding Europe after World War Two to the massive infrastructure projects behind China's economic resurgence.The key ingredient in concrete along with sand, gravel and water is cement. It takes a lot of energy to make and carbon dioxide (CO2) is also released during the manufacturing process.Here are some quick facts about cement's usage, its carbon footprint and efforts to reduce it:- At 2.4 gigatonnes, cement production accounted for 7% of global CO2 emissions in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). If it were a country, cement would have ranked third that year behind China and the United States and ahead of India in terms of emissions, IEA data shows.- Much of its carbon footprint is linked to its main constituent, clinker, which is produced in kilns at temperatures of about 1,450 Celsius (2,640 Fahrenheit) from limestone, clay and other materials. Emissions come from the decomposition of limestone in the process and the fuel used to heat the kilns.- Efforts to cut emissions include using more efficient kilns, switching to lower-carbon fuels, achieving a lower clinker-to-cement ratio and innovations such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) to stop the greenhouse gas entering the atmosphere. -  Reducing CO2 emissions while producing enough cement to meet demand will be very challenging, especially since demand growth is expected to resume as the slowdown in Chinese activity is offset by expansion in other markets,  the IEA said.- China, nonetheless, still accounts for more than half of the world's cement production with India in second place on about 8%, though that gap is expected to narrow over the next decade.- The IEA singled out Russia and a number of former Soviet countries for burning the most energy to produce clinker, mainly due to their continued use of old, so-called wet-process kilns.- The European Union has committed to introducing a carbon levy on imported cement from 2026 to protect its industry from cheaper, dirtier rivals and to discourage production being shifted out of the bloc to jurisdictions with less stringent emissions rules or lower carbon prices.- Germany's HeidelbergCement aims to make its Slite factory in Sweden the world's first carbon neutral cement plant by 2030. It plans to significantly increase the amount of biomass fuel used to run the plant and capture all of the 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 it emits each year.",

        "articleBody": "When a Swedish court ordered the country's biggest cement maker to stop mining limestone by its huge factory on the windswept island of Gotland to prevent pollution, ecologists cheered. Besides protecting wildlife and water supplies, the ruling could force the plant that makes 75% of Sweden's cement and is the country's second biggest carbon emitter to slash output while it finds raw materials elsewhere, or even shut altogether. That might be good for Sweden's emissions targets, but not such good news for the rest of the planet. A government-commissioned report seen by Reuters said it could force Sweden to import cement from countries that pump out more emissions in the overall manufacturing process - or risk massive job losses in the construction industry at home.  Imports from countries outside the EU would probably lead to larger environmental impacts as a result of lower standards related to CO2 emissions and lower standards in land use,  the report, obtained via a freedom of information request, said. Sweden's dilemma encapsulates one the challenges facing nations meeting in Glasgow for the U.N. COP26 climate talks: how to show they are not cutting emissions by simply exporting the problem elsewhere - a phenomenon known as  carbon leakage . A rich, stable Nordic democracy, Sweden has long topped international environmental rankings and has managed to cut back on greenhouse gases for years while preserving economic growth on a path towards its target of net zero emissions by 2045. It has the world's highest carbon tax at $137 per tonne and is a leader in the use of renewable energy. In 2018, its carbon emissions per head stood at 3.5 tonnes, well below the European Union average of 6.4 tonnes, according to World Bank data. But the stand-off over the Slite cement plant epitomises the growing tension between local environment goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement signed by nearly 200 countries to try to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius.  We have to weigh up the global focus - doing the most for the climate - but also maintain our high ambitions when it comes to our local environmental problems,  Sweden's Minster for Environment and Climate Per Bolund told Reuters.  These two things can be balanced.  ALTERNATIVE FUELSMuch of Europe's imported cement comes from Turkey, Russia, Belarus and countries in North Africa. They don't have anything like the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world's largest carbon market and one that sets the price of carbon permits for energy-intensive sectors, including cement, within the 27-nation bloc. The World Bank says only 22% of global emissions were covered by pricing mechanisms last year and the International Monetary Fund put the average global price of carbon at $3 a tonne - a tiny fraction of Sweden's carbon tax. While the Swedish court's decision was not linked to Slite's carbon footprint, but rather the risks its quarry poses to local groundwater, the impact from an emissions point of view depends on the efficiency and energy mix of the producers likely to supply Sweden with cement to plug any shortfalls. Slite's owner, Germany's HeidelbergCement, also plans to make it the world's first carbon neutral cement factory by 2030, but the uncertainty over its future following the court ruling may delay or even scupper the project.  We need a decision soon on the long-term basis for these operations if that is not to be delayed,  Magnus Ohlsson, chief executive of HeidelbergCement's Swedish subsidiary Cementa, said last month. Koen Coppenholle, head of European cement lobby group Cembureau, said he was confident European plants were  cleaner  overall because high EU carbon charges on producers had encouraged them to invest in reducing their emissions.  In Europe, right now, we are replacing 50% of our primary fuel needs by alternative fuels,  he said According to Cembureau data, however, imports of cement from outside the EU have jumped by about 160% in the last five years, even though total volumes remain relatively small. But carbon leakage, where emissions are shifted from countries with tight environmental rules to ones with laxer and cheaper regimes, is an issue for dozens of industries and policymakers are trying to tackle it. In July, the EU unveiled plans for the world's first carbon border tax to protect European industries, including cement, from competitors abroad whose manufacturers produce at lower cost because they are not charged for their carbon output. Europe's cement industry supports the move, but warns it is fraught with difficulties, such as how to measure emissions in different countries given varying processes and fuels.  If you impose strict requirements on CO2 and emissions, you have to make sure you do that in a way that you don't push companies outside the EU,  said Coppenholle.  That's the whole discussion on carbon leakage.  For a country such as Sweden, which has cut its emissions by 29% over the last three decades, the issue of domestic action versus global impact goes beyond cement. The country's already low, and declining, emissions from domestic production dropped to just under 60 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2018. But if you measure what Swedes consume, including goods and services produced abroad, the figure is about a third higher, according to Statistics Sweden, which put so-called consumption-based emissions at 82 million tonnes that year. CLIMATE IS GLOBALThe local versus global perspective also raises questions about which type of industrial policy is ultimately greener. Sweden's leading steel firm SSAB, state-owned miner LKAB and utility Vattenfall, for example, have invested heavily in developing a process to produce steel without using fossil fuels. They say switching to so-called green hydrogen power would reduce Sweden's emissions by about 10%, a big step towards reaching the country's 2045 net zero emission goal. But for researchers Magnus Henrekson at the Research Institute for Industrial Economics, Christian Sandstrom at Jonkoping International Business School and Carl Alm at the Ratio Institute, this is an example of the  environmental nationalism  that benefits one country, but not the world. They estimate that if Sweden exported the renewable energy it would use to make hydrogen to Poland and Germany instead - so they could cut back on coal-fired power - overall CO2 emissions would fall by 10 to 12 times more than by making  green  steel. The EU's carbon border levy, meanwhile, is only due to be phased in from 2026, potentially too late to have a bearing on the fate of Cementa's Slite limestone quarry. Sweden's parliament has agreed to a government proposal to tweak the country's environmental laws to give Cementa a stay of execution, but no long-term solution is in sight. Environmentalists such as David Kihlberg, climate head at the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, say easing regulations gives industries an excuse to put off changes that need to happen now.  It would be incredibly destructive for climate diplomacy if Sweden came to the top climate meeting in Glasgow and said our climate policy is to increase emissions and the local environmental impact in order to pull the rug from under Chinese cement producers,  he said, referring to a hypothetical scenario that is not Swedish policy.  The climate question is global and has to be solved by cooperation between countries. ",

        "articleBody": "Hectic negotiations are underway among G20 countries to set the agenda for the upcoming COP26 global climate talks in Glasgow and strike a consensus between the developed and developing nations to raise and hasten climate ambitions.On the table is a strong pitch for net-zero commitments, cutting coal use in the power sector, signing up on the methane pledge, reducing fuel subsidy, and upping the national climate targets -- also known as Nationally Determined Contributions.The developed nations are upping the ante and aim to finalise an ambitious climate action plan at the G20 heads of nations summit in Rome on October 30-31. On the other side of the divide are India, China, Brazil, Australia, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia -- countries where the growth agenda could be deeply impacted by these decisions. The 'net-zero' target is one of them. Developing nations in the G20 grouping have pointed out that this new ambition takes away the focus from -- and is outside -- the existing commitments under the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC ) framework, to limit global warming to below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.The Methane Pledge signed last week by the US and European Union has also elicited varying responses from several G20 nations. There is growing pressure for all nations, particularly high emitters like China, India, Russia and Brazil, to sign up to the 'Methane Pledge' -- a commitment to cut methane gas emission by 30% by 2030.There are serious reservations on the same given that it will impact both livestock and agriculture in these nations. Another key area of debate is the call for decarbonisation of the power sector by 2030. Nations like India -- where 60%-70% electricity currently comes from coal-fired power plants -- besides Australia and others which also depend heavily on coal-based power are said to be pitching for a 'low carbon' growth trajectory instead.Similarly, there are differences of opinion on the call to stop financing of new coal-based projects abroad, bring down fuel subsidy by 25%, introduce carbon pricing and commit to creating carbon sinks equivalent to green house gas emissions -- moves with significant implications and cost to economy for developing nations. Suggestions to bring in a G20 based 'review' of implementation of NDCs of G20 nations and an annual 'peer review' of the fuel subsidy cuts -- as different from the UNFCCC framework -- has also ruffled feathers.

        "articleBody": "As the Indian economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic that hit it hard, it is important for the country to focus on public investment, particularly in green sectors, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday.  As we move towards the recovery, it is also important to focus on public investment, particularly on green investment, so that the recovery can be inclusive and green,  IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department Deputy Director Paolo Mauro told reporters during a news conference.He said India's debt is at the ratio of about 90 per cent, and it is important to give a signal that there is a medium\u2011term fiscal framework in place that ensures investors that the debt ratio will decline in the medium term. Responding to a question, Mauro said the situation is improving when it comes to the epidemic. It is very different from a few months ago, he said, adding, fortunately, the number of cases is declining and the vaccination is becoming more widespread.  On the economic front, therefore, even though the situation is improving, the priority remains to address the health emergency. It remains to provide ample support, particularly to the poorer segments of the population through social protection, employment benefits, and so on,  Mauro said.  In terms of more recent reforms, one that I would like to highlight is the National Asset Reconstruction Company, the so\u2011called bad bank. This is potentially very promising because it is important to tackle non\u2011performing loans,  he said. This has been a long\u2011standing drag on credit, and potentially this is very promising, he added.  It is very important that both the governance and the independence of such so\u2011called bad banks be in place so that the costs to public finances can be kept under control and one can go back to promoting inclusive growth,  Mauro said.",

        "articleBody": "The latest Inter-Government Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report declared a \u2018code red\u2019 for humankind. It seems inevitable that global temperature rise will breach the 1.5\u00b0C mark by the early 2030s. Further, as the report suggests, if we continue to remain on a high emission pathway, temperatures could rise by up to 4.4\u00b0C by 2100, leading to a catastrophic situation.In India, the transport sector is currently the third largest emitter of CO2 and will remain an important part of the discussions and efforts around curbing emissions. Under a business-as-usual scenario, the transport sector could be responsible for around 1.5 gigatons of annual carbon emissions by 2050. India has already committed to more than half-a-dozen focus areas for clean transport as part of its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.It is now time to revisit these transport commitments and scale up our actions. While this is made harder by the need to increase per capita incomes in the country, which is historically associated with higher emissions, there are certain areas where actions can be immediately scaled up.To reduce emissions from transport, the role of significantly increasing the share of railways in passenger and freight segments is unquestionable. Current studies suggest the share of railways for freight to be 25-27% as compared to 36% estimated for the year 2005. To achieve rail-share of 45% -- a target envisaged in NDC document -- would require meticulous planning, massive investment in augmenting capacity, and rolling out proactive policies.The Energy and Research Institute\u2019s (TERI) research suggests adoption of commodity-specific dealings with customised and assured services to the customers. Piecemeal lightweight traffic should be prioritised, particularly when coal traffic is projected to be taken over by the \u2018balance other goods\u2019 category in the coming decades.Coming to road transport, under the 2021-22 budget, GoI announced Rs18,000 crore for the purchase of buses by state governments. Such allocation should be made an annual practice to support green and efficient modes of transport. In addition, development of metro systems should be done on a rational basis and should be subsidised and sustained by city governments.As per ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH), there is a \u2018need to improve performance of the fleet, improve occupational ratio, and deploy technology solutions to improve service quality and compete with private bus/taxi services\u2019 so as to enhance the contribution of public transport in overall emissions.Improving non-motorised transport (NMT) infrastructure, along with improved urban planning, becomes critical for safe, efficient, and clean mobility. Investment in NMT infrastructure is a fraction of what is invested in constructing flyovers and metro systems that cater to a limited clientele. Investment in NMT infrastructure could be supported by dedicating a portion of the tax collected on diesel and gasoline towards national highways and rural roads development.It is important that India does not emulate the path taken by most developed countries and have a higher share of private passenger cars as proportion of its population. Regulating the growth in private vehicles through carbon tax and redirecting demand towards cleaner technologies would save foreign exchange on imported fuel, and reduce road congestion and emissions. The newer vehicles on our streets must be zero emission. Present policies focus on purchase subsidies, which is a good short-term solution. However, aggressively stepping up investment in charging infrastructure is needed, with a differentiated strategy for urban and inter-city segments, as well as augmenting electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing capacities.Fast tracking the roll-out of a scrappage policy and green tax while taking state governments onboard to implement it in letter and spirit will lead to adoption of efficient and cleaner vehicle technologies. The auto industry must realize the urgency of the situation and come on-board in implementing efficiency measures. These measures are critical for the commercial vehicle segment. Emission standards for all categories of commercial vehicles should be put in place on an urgent basis.India continues to lag behind on its target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol and 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel by 2030. The time has come to ensure these targets are met well in advance, by ensuring adequate supply of biofuel throughout the year and geography. There needs to be a clear roadmap and understanding between the government and auto industry on the availability of biofuels. Scaling up the production of bio-diesel for blending with aviation turbine fuel is also required.We do not have much time and choice left but to act towards low carbon transport sector. Without significant intervention, the transport sector could become a hurdle in achieving 2030 climate goals and global net zero emissions by 2050. The need for transforming the sector is imminent and all stakeholders, including policymakers and industries have to come together to achieve the ambitious goal of decarbonizing the sector.The job is difficult, but we must do all we can to bring down carbon emissions. It is now a question of our very survival.",

India is ranked sixth among the top 30 PPA markets.India's thriving renewable energy market conditions, inclusive policy decisions, investment and technology improvements focusing on self-reliant supply chains have pushed the clean energy transition to new heights, the statement said.However, it said that the sector must be careful to navigate bottlenecks that could threaten continued rapid growth.The EY report reveals that the drive to integrate increasing volumes of variable resources is set to put grid infrastructure under significant strain, and the investment required to upgrade and expand energy transmission infrastructure across the globe will be a key challenge.Somesh Kumar, Partner and National Leader, Power & Utilities, EY India, said, \u201cIn August 2021, India witnessed a watershed moment in combatting the climate crisis. The total installed renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) crossed the milestone of 100 GW .According to the report, the US, mainland China and India continue to retain the top three rankings and Indonesia is a new entrant to the RECAI.The US continues its top ranking on RECAI and is expected to hold its position as new initiatives are being announced under President Joe Biden. Mainland China and India remain unchanged in the ranking at second and third position, respectively, as favourable regulatory and investment conditions continue in these markets, it said.The top-performing markets have held their ground in this latest issue \u2013 with no movement into or out of the top eight. France (fourth position, up by one) and the UK (fifth position, down by one), while Germany (sixth position, up by one) has edged back ahead of Australia (seventh position, down by one) after its onshore wind market had a fruitful first half of 2021, with 971MW added, marking a 62 per cent rise from the first half of 2020, it stated.Also, under the spotlight are policy support and notable government auction rounds for Greece, Spain, Taiwan and the UK. The Philippines (27th position, up by four) has moved up the ranking with an indicated target of achieving 35 per cent renewable energy by 2030, while also setting out its offshore wind road map, it added.

        "articleBody": "Investment in renewable energy needs to triple by the end of the decade if the world hopes to effectively fight climate change and keep volatile energy markets under control, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday.  The world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs ... transition\u2010related spending is gradually picking up, but remains far short of what is required to meet rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way,  the IEA said.  Clear signals and direction from policy makers are essential. If the road ahead is paved only with good intentions, then it will be a bumpy ride indeed,  it added. The Paris-based watchdog released its annual World Energy Outlook early this year to guide the United Nations COP26 climate change conference, now less than a month away. It called the Glasgow, Scotland meeting the  first test of the readiness of countries to submit new and more ambitious commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement  and  an opportunity to provide an 'unmistakeable signal' that accelerates the transition to clean energy worldwide.  In recent weeks, power prices surged to record levels as oil and natural gas prices hit multi-year highs and widespread energy shortages engulfed Asia, Europe and the United States. Fossil fuel demand is also recovering as governments ease curbs to contain the spread of COVID-19. The IEA warned that renewables like solar, wind and hydropower along with bioenergy need to form a far bigger share in the rebound in energy investment after the pandemic. Renewables will account for more than two-thirds of investment in new power capacity this year, the IEA noted, yet a sizeable gain in coal and oil use have caused the second-largest annual increase in climate change-causing CO2 emissions. The IEA said a faster energy transition will better shield consumers in the future, because a commodity price shock would drive up costs for households 30% less in its most ambitious Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario versus in its more conservative Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). STATUS QUO VERSUS NET ZEROStill, the leap necessary to make good on pledges in the 2015 Paris Agreement to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times remains vast. Fossil fuels coal, natural gas and oil made up nearly 80% of world energy supply in 2020 and renewables just 12%. To keep that rise near 1.5 degrees, the IEA's NZE prediction envisions those fossil fuels shrinking to just under a quarter of the mid-century supply mix and renewables skyrocketing to just over two-thirds. If the world stays on its current track outlined by STEPS scenario, temperatures will jump 2.6 degrees Celsius by 2100. The IEA foresees a peak to oil demand in all its scenarios for the first time, in the mid\u20102030s in the STEPS forecast with a very gradual decline but in the NZE forecast plateauing within a decade and dropping further by nearly three-quarters by 2050. Doubling down on the agency's starkest warning yet on the future of fossil fuels that it made in a May report, the IEA said its NZE picture envisioned lower demand and a rise in low emissions fuels making new oil and gas fields beyond 2021 unnecessary. However, it did say new oil fields would be required in its two most conservative scenarios and provided tips on mitigating their climate impact like reducing methane flaring.  Every data point showing the speed of change in energy can be countered by another showing the stubbornness of the status quo,  the IEA warned.  Today's energy system is not capable of meeting these challenges; a low emissions revolution is long overdue. ",

        "articleBody": "Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday stressed on the need to divert excess sugar stock for ethanol manufacturing as provision of subsidies on exports of sweetener will not be permissable after December 2023 under the WTO regime. Addressing a webinar on alternative fuels organised by industry body ISMA, the minister said the government is promoting ethanol manufacturing in a big way and assured that it will procure all ethanol produced in the country.  With increased supply of ethanol, Gadkari said the government plans to introduce flex fuel engine vehicles in the country.  With the rollout of flex-fuel vehicles on 100 per cent bio-ethanol, the demand for ethanol will immediately jump by 4 to 5 times, he added.  The minister also asked sugar mills to set up their own ethanol pumps, which are being permitted by the government.   It is under our purview that we can take the decision for making mandatory flex engine for the petrol vehicles. So, that can increase the demand of ethanol in Indian market,  Gadkari said.  Stating that the government is giving permission for the ethanol pump, the minister told sugar mills that they can establish their own pumps.   Now there is a policy and my own sugar factory, also my son has taken the permission,  he added.  Gadkari said the government is providing export subisdy to the tune of Rs 3,000 to Rs 6,000 crore to sugar mills for liquidating surplus sugar stocks.   Due to our commitments to international organisations such as WTO, these subsidies will not be permissable after December 2023,  he pointed out.  As a solution to this problem, Gadkari suggested that the excess sugar stocks can be diverted towards producing ethanol by adding 15-20 per cent sugar into B-Heavy Molasses.   This will have multiple benefits - firstly, it will utilise an excess stock of around 45 to 60 lakh metric tonnes of sugar and will improve the ethanol recovery by 30 per cent due to better quality of raw material,  he said.  Stressing on the need to discourage the use of petrol or diesel as a fuel, he said the focus should be on the adoption of alternative fuels which will be import substitute, cost-effective, pollution-free and indigenous.   To make this possible, I am giving a special push for ethanol as fuel. The biggest benefit is that it is a clean fuel with very low greenhouse gas emissions,  the minister said.  The additional income that is generated is directly diverted to the farmers, which empowers the rural and backward economy.   Ethanol can be the tool to empower our rural and backward areas where we can increase employment and bring prosperity into the lives of our farmers,  he observed.  Gadkari highlighted that India started its programme for ethanol blending with petrol in 2003 but made it mandatory at 5 per cent in 2007.  The government brought the fixed ethanol procurement pricing policy from December 2014.  From around 1 per cent blending in 2014, the country has achieved 5 per cent ethanol blending with petrol in the next 5 years.  From 2018 onwards, Gadkari said the government has been fixing multiple prices for ethanol, based on the feedstock used to produce ethanol.  This encouraged diversion of B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice into the production of ethanol, he added.   Now, we have allowed the use of grains like corn, surplus rice, damaged food grains, sweet sorghum, bajra, jawar for the production of ethanol,  he said.  Looking at the ethanol production capacity and its adoptability as a fuel, Gadkari said the government has redesigned and launched the E-20 fuel programme which will ensure the use of bio-ethanol in 20 per cent blend with petrol by 2025 in India.  To achieve 20 per cent ethanol blending, the country will require around 10 billion litres of ethanol by 2025. At present, the sugar industry contributes to 90 per cent of ethanol demand as a blended fuel in the country.  To increase ethanol production with available resources, Gadkari suggested to add 15-20 per cent sugar into B-Heavy Molasses.   For the pricing, the production of ethanol from sugarcane juice or syrup has been facing some problems. The same pricing of approx. Rs 62/litre can be considered as an incentive for sugar millers to divert their excess sugar stocks into B-Heavy Molasses,  he said.  Gadkari also spoke about the need to discouraging production of C-Heavy Molasses from sugar.   This will standardise the production of B-Heavy Molasses and will permanently lead to lesser production of sugar by 1.5 per cent per metric tonne of sugarcane,  he said, adding that these steps could boost ethanol output.  The minister pointed out that the country's import dependence on petroleum is expected to go up to the tune of Rs 15 lakh crore in the next 5 years.   Increased availability of ethanol will directly help in introduction of flex engines, which we will soon introduced in India,  he said.  Gadkari said the incentives provided to sugar mills have been extended to the grain-based ethanol distilleries since January 2021.   The target is to get around 4 billion litres of ethanol production from grain-based distilleries,  he said.  Gadkari said that with 100 per cent use of a 20 per cent blend of bio-ethanol, the country will be able to save Rs 30,000 crore on import of fossil fuels.   We are planning to introduce flex-fuel vehicles soon which allow the operation of the vehicles on 100 per cent bio-ethanol or 100 per cent petrol,  he added.  Gadkari said the government of India is seriously working on how to increase the use of ethanol in transport sector.  The Prime Minister has recently launched three 100 per cent ethanol pumps and the petroleum ministry is now promoting the setting up of dispensing units by private entities.   Currently, the ethanol economy is Rs 20,000 crore which I am targeting to raise to Rs 2 lakh crore,  he said.  Gadkari emphasised on conducting research on how to successfully blend ethanol with diesel.  The minister said that bio-ethanol can also be a sustainable fuel for aviation purpose.  Besides ethanol, he said the government is promoting the use of clean and green alternative fuels such as Methanol, Bio-diesel, Bio-CNG, LNG, H-CNG, Electricity, and Hydrogen fuel cell in addition to ethanol.",

        "articleBody": "Global plans to build carbon capture and storage (CCS) plants have mushroomed over the last nine months as governments and companies accelerate the hunt for ways to cut emissions and curb global warming by mid-century, a think tank said on Tuesday. The capacity of planned projects soared to 111 million tonnes a year (mtpa) as of end-September, up 52% from 73 mtpa at the end of 2020, the Melbourne-based Global CCS Institute said in an annual status report. If built, those projects would nearly treble the 40 mtpa of CCS capacity now operating. While there was more capacity on the drawing board than now a decade ago, high costs stopped most projects going ahead. Just last weekend, demolition began at a multi-billion dollar power plant in Mississippi where costs blew out so much that regulators stopped a CCS project. But CCS costs have since fallen while the impetus for emissions cuts has grown, Global CCS Institute general manager Alex Zapantis said.  The drivers have become much stronger from a business perspective. The costs are coming down,  said Zapantis.  All of this is on the basis of rapidly rising expectations for stronger climate action by pretty much everyone. That's why we'll continue to see this rise in projects.  Critics say CCS is a waste of money and will prolong the life of dirty fossil fuels, but advocates, including the International Energy Agency, see CCS as essential to help meet net zero emissions. Planned capacity has grown the most in North America, partly due to tax credits for CCS. More than 40 projects have been announced this year, including Exxon Mobil Corp's huge Houston Ship Channel CCS concept. In Europe, spurred by tough emissions targets and high carbon prices, there are 35 projects in development. The UK, Belgium and the Netherlands added 17 this year. In the Asia Pacific region, projects in Indonesia and Malaysia tied to gas developments have been approved recently and Zapantis said more projects in the region are awaiting clarity on compliance regulations before going ahead. The institute's CCS projects report is typically compiled annually but was released earlier than normal to coincide with the COP26 United Nations climate talks due to take place in Glasgow this month. The UN conference could boost the business case for CCS projects if governments agree to a framework that recognises and values CCS along with other sources of emissions reduction, Zapantis said.",

        "articleBody": "Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Monday called for promoting new and innovative low-carbon technologies that ensure housing, service delivery and better mobility for all, and place people at the forefront of sustainable urban development. The increasing global urban footprint makes more energy demands in cities which are already responsible for 78 per cent of global energy consumption and 70 per cent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, he said. The Union housing and urban affairs minister was speaking at an event to mark the UN World Habitat Day 2021, with the theme of 'Accelerating Urban Action for a Carbon-free World'. Speaking on the economic and environmental imperatives for Indian cities, Puri said India's per capita emission of greenhouse gases is quite low as compared to other developed countries. He said India's cumulative CO2 emissions from 1870-2017 is only three per cent as against 25 per cent of the USA, 22 per cent of the EU and the UK, and 13 per cent of China.  India aims to reach the kind of economic growth that the advanced economies have reached in the past through their heavy industrialisation patterns but India may not necessarily follow that path of development as we are aware of the environmental cost.  India recognises the importance of its cities in the country's transformation as India's urban areas are expected to contribute as much as 70 per cent of the national GDP by 2030,  a statement quoted Puri as saying. The minister said that India has to achieve economic aspirations and realise its environmental responsibilities, adding that there can be no doubt that planning for low-carbon cities will be necessary to achieve the sustainable development goals in the country, particularly Goal 11 and Goal 13.  If SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) succeeds, it will be because India will succeed,  he said, adding that global targets are not likely to be met without India's contributions. Puri said the urban missions like the Swachh Bharat Mission, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Smart Cities Mission, Urban Transport, and AMRUT launched by the Modi government have contributed immensely to reducing GHG emissions. Not only were these missions part of the most comprehensive urbanisation programmes, they are also important components of our response to climate change, Puri said. On the use of sustainable and energy-efficient methods in building houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), he said certified green buildings can deliver energy savings between 20-30 per cent and water savings of up to 30-50 per cent. More than 16 lakh houses being built under the mission today are utilising green technologies, and this will help in mitigating around 12 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent of GHG emissions by 2022 under the PMAY Mission, the minister said. PMAY prioritised the promotion of low-carbon building technologies through the Global Housing Technology Challenge, wherein six Light House Projects (LHP) consisting of about 1,000 houses each are being constructed, he added. On his part, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said that urban centres are critical to delivering or creating a climate safe world.  Cities are more dependent on energy than rural areas and have considerable ecological footprints,  Mishra said, adding that accelerated urbanisation catapults demands for mass transportation, commercial and industrial activities and exerts undue pressure on vacant urban land.",

        "articleBody": "GE Gas Power on Monday said India can make substantive reductions in emissions from the power sector through the accelerated and strategic deployment of renewables and gas power. GE Gas Power released a position paper titled 'The key to India's energy future' that discusses India's urgent need to cutting CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions from the power sector and adopting near-zero carbon power generation technology.  The position paper advocates and outlines policy actions that can help India to chart a unique path to a cleaner economy with affordable, reliable and sustainable power for all, according to a statement by GE Gas Power.   India can make substantive reductions in emissions from the power sector through the accelerated and strategic deployment of renewables and gas power,  it stated.  The position paper advocates and outlines policy actions that can help India to chart a unique path to a cleaner economy with affordable, reliable and sustainable power for all, it added. India is facing significant environmental challenges, owing to the emissions from the power sector, dominated by fossil fuel-based power generation.  The power sector in India accounts for 49 per cent of total CO2 emissions, compared with the global average of 41 per cent, it explained.  On the other hand, the electricity demand in India is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5 per cent during 2018-40.  It's critical to urgently adopt cleaner powering technologies at a scale that can complement each other and act as growth levers towards creating a sustainable power generation mix, it added.  Deepesh Nanda, chief executive officer of GE Gas Power South Asia, said,  India's strategy to move towards using low to zero-carbon fuels for electricity generation is bringing a paradigm shift in the energy space in the region as well as globally.   However, the country's plan to provide round-the-clock power for all in the backdrop of the growing renewable energy (RE) base is facing challenges such as intermittency of renewable power, low-capacity utilisation of transmission system and grid firming requirements as RE achieves scale in the coming decades, Nanda added.  He said this is leading to renewables curtailment and there is an urgent need to meet the flexibility requirements of the power system operation, providing adequate base-load power and reliability of electricity supply.  GE believes that a two-part tariff based on peak and non-peak demand is key to address the flexibility needs of the system, it said.  The position paper presents a scenario wherein gas-fired power plants, which can be developed quickly, taking significantly less space and at scale, are available regardless of the time of day or weather conditions, providing dependable capacity as long as needed, whether for minutes, hours, days or weeks at a time.  Emission compliant and flexible gas-based power generation, with its quick start-up, deeper turndown levels and faster ramp rates is a key enabler to integrate more renewables into the national grid and meet seasonal and peak power demand.  Nanda said India has the potential to become the global focal point when it comes to adopting new low-carbon technology.  He added that policy-level interventions to mitigate the existing power sector challenges can instil confidence among the investors and ensure inclusive growth.  Such steps can help India to move faster towards achieving energy security in the coming decades.   Based on a study of the Indian power sector and GE's global experience, GE Gas Power makes key recommendations in the position paper with respect to the round-the-clock power plan.  As India embarks on its journey to become a global hub for green hydrogen, GE believes hydrogen to be a key focus area having major roleplay in power generation.  GE Gas Power is a world leader in natural gas power technology, services, and solutions. In India, the company has a significant installed base of over 260 utility and industrial gas turbines across both government and private sector power plants.",

        "articleBody": "The transition towards cleaner energy has made progress but not quick enough to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. While the Covid-19 pandemic initially caused a drop in greenhouse gas emissions as economic activity dropped, the pandemic may not have accelerated the shift to renewables:Renewables boomRenewables are now the number two source of electricity in the world with a 26 percent share in 2019 -- behind coal, but ahead of natural gas and nuclear. Wind and solar power have grown at annual rates of 22 and 36 percent, respectively as their prices have plunged since 1990. Even during the pandemic, 26 gigawatts (GW) of capacity was added last year, setting a new record, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). But the use of fossil fuels in final consumption (electricity, transportation fuel, heating and factory production) has held steady. At 80.3 percent in 2009, it was still 80.2 percent in 2019, as overall energy consumption increases thanks to population growth as well as rising incomes in Asia.Sharp turn by automakersPushed by tighter pollution regulations, leading automakers are aiming to scrap internal combustion engines within the next decade or sharply cut their production as they shift towards all-electric futures. Roads are still crowded with polluting cars: Electric vehicles only make up five percent of new units sold. The International Energy Agency says consumers continue to prefer big SUVs -- they accounted for 42 percent of sales in 2020 -- that pollute more than smaller models.HydrogenFrom Australia to China to the EU, more and more nations are setting their sites on green hydrogen for lorries and factories. While burning hydrogen as a fuel emits just water, most of the gas is made in a process that produces harmful emissions. Finding cost effective ways to produce hydrogen cleanly and developing the infrastructure for its use will require more effort, with the IEA urging a quadrupling of investments in the sector.Carbon pricingIn mid-2020 some 44 countries and 31 cities accounting for 60 percent of global economic output had carbon pricing (taxes or quotas) schemes in place, according to the I4CE think tank. Carbon prices aim to make polluters pay for some of the social costs of emissions such as health care costs due to poor air quality and crop damage due to climate change.  Experts say the price needs to be between $40 and $80 per tonne of CO2 to push polluters to increase efficiency or shift to renewable energy sources.  However, the price is under $10 for 75 percent of covered emissions.Pandemic investmentThe Ren 21 think tank said the coronavirus pandemic provided an opportunity to shift public policy, but countries provided six times as much investment money to fossil fuel than renewable energy projects in their economic recovery plans. After dropping by seven percent thanks to the pandemic, CO2 emissions are expected to hit new records by 2023 if those investments are not shifted.Emerging difficultiesInvestment in renewable energy has been sliding for several years in emerging and developing nations except for China, and the coronavirus pandemic has done nothing to change the situation. These countries hold two-thirds of the world's population and are responsible for 90 percent of the growth in emissions, but they are receiving only 20 percent of investments into clean energy, according to the IEA.King coal still reignsLong ago baptised  king coal  for its outsize role in powering the world economy, the fuel remains in wide use in Asia to meet the growing needs for electricity in the region. The global economic recovery means that coal demand is likely to surpass its 2019 level and thus also retain its crown of being the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. China, which has been a major financer of coal projects in other nations, announced in September it is halting the practice.",

        "articleBody": "India's new liberalised petrol pump licensing norms allow setting up of EV charging stations and CNG outlets even before the start of petrol and diesel sales, the government has stated. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in a clarification to its November 8, 2019 order that eased norms for setting up of petrol pumps by new entities, said the order provides for petrol pumps selling one new generation alternate fuels like CNG, LNG or electric vehicle charging points alongside retailing petrol and diesel, but does not prescribe an order of them being set up.   While an authorised entity is required to set up its retail outlets for petrol and diesel... the said entity is required to install facilities for at least one new generation alternate fuels like CNG, biofuels, LNG, electric vehicle charging points etc at the proposed retail outlets,  the ministry said in an October 5 notice.  The 2019 order however  does not prescribe the order in which the dispensation of conventional fuels (petrol and diesel) and the new generation alternate fuels would be started, i.e. dispensation of bio fuels and CNG, EV charging can be started before dispensing of petrol and diesel,  it said.  The new liberalised rule allows any entity with a minimum net worth of Rs 250 crore to apply for authorisation to retail petrol and diesel.  Under the November 2019 policy, petrol pump licence has so far been granted to Reliance Industries Ltd, IMC Ltd, Onsite Energy Pvt Ltd, Assam Gas Company, M K Agrotech, RBML Solutions India Ltd and Manas Agro Industries and Infrastructure.  RIL already had a fuel retailing licence, under which it had set up over 1,400 petrol pumps in the country. But this licence was transferred to its subsidiary Reliance BP Mobility (RBML).  And so, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's firm applied and got another licence.  A separate joint venture of the firm with BP, called RBML Solutions India Ltd too has got a licence.  It isn't clear if RIL and RBML Solutions will set up separate, competing petrol pumps.  Besides doing away with the earlier requirement of investing Rs 2,000 crore in oil and gas sector to be eligible for a fuel retailing licence, the new liberalised petrol pump norms require licensees to set up a minimum of 100 outlets with at least 5 per cent of them in remote areas.  The licensee is required to  install facilities for marketing at least one new generation alternate fuels like compressed natural gas (CNG), biofuels, liquefied natural gas, electric vehicle charging points etc at their proposed retail outlets within three years of operationalisation of the said outlet.   It fixes Rs 250 crore as the minimum net worth for obtaining the licence.  State-owned oil marketing companies -- Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) -- currently own most of the 78,751 petrol pumps in the country.  RBML, Nayara Energy (formerly Essar Oil) and Royal Dutch Shell are the private players in the market but with limited presence. RBML has 1,427 outlets, Nayara 6,250 while Shell has just 285 pumps.  BP had a few years back secured a licence to set up 3,500 pumps but has not yet started doing so. It has since decided to venture into the business with RIL with plans to scale up RIL's present network strength to 5,500.  Those granted licences include Chennai-based IMC (once called Indian Molasses Company), which specialises in oil terminals, and Assam government firm, Assam Gas Company.  Assam Gas Company is in the business of gas transportation.  Not much is known about Onsite Energy which was incorporated in May 2020.  M K Agrotech is part of a diversified conglomerate with interests across agricultural products such as sunflower oil, real estate, and crude oil and gas extraction, while Manas Agro Industries and Infrastructure has its own brand of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG or cooking gas).",

As we gear up to host the UN COP26 summit next month, today the UK and India have made important progress in outlining how this deep partnership can continue to deliver green growth for both countries powered by clean energy,  said Kwarteng.   Supporting the move to clean energy is a shared priority, and our new joint programme on smart power, renewable energy and storage will help to increase investment in renewable projects, while creating new high skilled jobs across both nations as we build back greener,  he said.  In addition to providing a springboard for India's renewable energy market in areas such as offshore wind, BEIS said the agreed joint programme will help to create digital solutions for power distribution companies, improving industrial energy efficiency, and boosting electric mobility in ways that maximise business opportunities and investments.  Both ministers also discussed how COP26, to be held in Glasgow between November 1 and 12, is an opportunity to show global leadership on clean energy, including the expected launch of the UK and Indian government's Global Green Grids - One Sun One World One Grid Initiative, by delegations of UK and India.   This initiative will bring together an international coalition of national governments, financial organisations, and power system operators to accelerate the construction of new infrastructure needed to deliver a massive scale-up of secure, reliable and affordable power, such as modern, flexible grids, charging points, and electricity interconnectors,  BEIS said.  During Friday's dialogue, both sides highlighted India's advancement of solar energy to power the Indian Railways, welcoming close collaboration through the India-led International Solar Alliance, which aims to mobilise more than USD 1 trillion of investments in solar energy by 2030.   Action on climate change is a central pillar of the 2030 Roadmap agreed by Prime Ministers Modi and Johnson,  said Alex Ellis, British High Commissioner to India.   The Energy Dialogue today advanced our joint agenda to develop clean energy to support sustainable growth for both our economies,  he said.  The ministers highlighted the importance of a  strong, home-grown renewable energy sector  being the cornerstone for building a secure energy system.   Decarbonisation also provides excellent opportunities to create green jobs, champion gender inclusivity, and drive economic growth across both India and the UK,  BEIS said.  Following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Cooperation in the Energy Sector in November 2015, a regular ministerial energy dialogue was instituted between India and the UK in April 2017 and the second one took place in 2018.  Friday's dialogue marked the third instalment, which is aimed at strengthening India-UK collaboration on accelerating the move to global clean energy in the decade ahead.",

        "articleBody": "Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said he has asked US-based Tesla several times to manufacture its iconic electric vehicles in India, while assuring that all support will be provided by the government to the company. Addressing 'India Today Conclave 2021', Gadkari further said electric cars manufactured by Tata Motors are not less good than electric cars manufactured by Tesla.   I have told Tesla that don't sell electric cars in India which your company has manufactured in China. You should manufacture electric cars in India, and also export cars from India,  he said.         Tesla has demanded reduction in import duties on electric vehicles (EVs) in India.   Whatever support you (Tesla) want, will be provided by our government,  Gadkari added.          The road transport and highways minister said that he is still in dialogue with Tesla officials regarding the company's demand related to tax concessions.          Last month, the heavy industries ministry had also asked Tesla to first start manufacturing its iconic electric vehicles in India before any tax concessions can be considered.           At present, cars imported as completely built units (CBUs) attract customs duty ranging from 60-100 per cent, depending on engine size and cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value less or above USD 40,000.          In a letter to the road ministry, the US firm had stated that the effective import tariff of 110 per cent on vehicles with customs value above USD 40,000 is  prohibitive  to zero-emission vehicles.       It has requested the government to standardize the tariff on electric cars to 40 per cent irrespective of the customs value, and withdraw the social welfare surcharge of 10 per cent on electric cars.     It has stated that these changes would boost the development of the Indian EV ecosystem and the company will make significant direct investments in sales, service, and charging infrastructure; and significantly increase procurement from India for its global operations.         The company has argued that these proposals would not have any negative impact on the Indian automotive market as no Indian OEM currently produces a car (EV or ICE) with ex-factory price above USD 40,000 and only 1-2 per cent of cars sold in India (EV or ICE) have ex-factory/customs value above USD 40,000.        Recently, Gadkari had said Tesla has a golden opportunity to set up its manufacturing facility in India given the country's thrust on e-vehicles.         Tesla is already sourcing various auto components from Indian automakers and setting up base here would be economically viable for it, he had said.",

        "articleBody": "Coal stocks at power plants are beginning to improve with the monsoon retreating and the government's focus will now be on meeting the demand of more than 200 GW expected next summer, power and renewable energy minister RK Singh told ET in an interview. India will not shy away from building more coal-based power plants if needed for energy security, he said. We have an average four days' coal stock-I won't call it a crisis,  the minister said.  It is a tight situation and we have to keep a watch. Hopefully, we will not be in a crisis because we are meeting whatever demand is coming. The coal situation should improve, he said.  I believe now the rains have stopped, so our (coal) supplies will pick up. Yesterday, 268 rakes were supplied, which is 13-14 days more than the average of 254,  Singh said.India's thermal power stations are operating with coal stocks at alarmingly low levels as rain hit supplies and power demand surged. Data showed that, on October 6, as much as 133 GW of India's monitored 165 GW coal base capacity operated with low inventory, sufficient for just seven days. Plants with a capacity of about 90 GW have less than four days of stock.Power demand will decrease from mid-October and plants need to start building coal stocks. We will have to continue building stocks right up to March end. That stock will serve us till October next year. Those who don't maintain that stock will be given the last priority in coal allocation when a crisis happens,  he said. CEA to Review Coal Stocking Policy Singh said the power ministry has asked its technical arm, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), to review the coal stocking policy. The current policy calculates per-day stock requirement of a project based on its previous consumption. It will have to be based on at least 75% PLF (plant load factor). The 17 days of coal stock we had in mid-June this year as per present norms did not prove to be sufficient,  he said, adding that this should ensure that there is no fuel crisis in the future.He said the government is looking at the law to see how imported coal-based plants can be made operational. These plants have been shut because coal imports are pricey and the cost can't be passed on to consumers.Rising Power DemandSingh said the country's power demand is growing rapidly and is expected to cross a minimum 200 GW as the economy is growing and the country expanded its consumer base by 28.2 million new consumers by connecting all households.He said India will not compromise on energy security and not shy away from building more coal-based plants if required to service this demand. We are not going to compromise the requirement of energy for our growth,  he said, adding that India was among the countries doing most on renewables.  I am adding huge quantities of renewables and am also adding storage which increases costs. I can't increase the cost for the people beyond a point. If the price of storage comes down soon enough, probably we are not going to be starting any new coal-based projects. Developing nations have used up much of the carbon space, while India is the only nation on the way to achieve its emissions reduction targets, he said.Renewables FocusSingh said every major economy has a fossil fuel-based base load. Despite all this talk of shifting to renewables, we still need base load because storage is expensive,  Singh said.  All western countries have been talking about transition, they don't have a clear-cut path, which I keep telling them. Solar power, for instance, is available only during the day and has to be stored for it to be supplied at night. This storage is still expensive, and until rates fall, thermal power will continue to be the mainstay.He said India is the only country that has started adding energy storage, working on green hydrogen and has called bids promoting renewables. We are ahead of the curve in terms in so far as energy transition is concerned,  he said.  You can talk but ultimately you need the technology and start investing in it so that the prices come down. They haven't. India is the only G-20 country whose actions on energy transition are consistent with the sub-two degree Celsius rise in global temperature, he said. They have been responsible for occupying 75% of carbon space. They are talking about going to net zero in 2050,  he said.  At the rate at which they are going, the remaining 25% of the carbon space will be occupied by 2045. How will it make a difference if they come to net zero by 2050--it's too late. Electricity BillThe Electricity Act Amendment Bill that proposes to open the power distribution sector to competition is with the cabinet. Singh said only four states-West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab and Telangana--have opposed the bill.  The industry and people are in favour of it,  he said.",

        "articleBody": "The government has asked Indian Oil Corporation, BPCL, HPCL and GAIL to present a detailed plan by the end of the month on how they intend to produce, procure and consume green hydrogen, said people familiar with the matter.The government is putting together a large plan to adopt green hydrogen as part of the energy transition and expects oil and fertiliser companies to lead it. Refineries have been the biggest user of hydrogen, although all of it is currently produced using fossil fuel.State-run oil and gas companies are expected to offer details on their production plan, including proposed capacity, location of the facilities, source of renewable energy and anticipated consumption pattern, said the people. The companies also need to present their investment and funding plans.GAIL, the nation\u2019s largest natural gas marketer and transporter, is expected to draw up plans on transporting hydrogen-blended natural gas, said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified. Its plan is expected to throw light on whether the state-run would produce green hydrogen in-house or source it from outside.Some pilots in Europe have concluded that the current network of natural gas pipelines in the continent was capable of handling a 10% blend of hydrogen. But as the blend ratio rises, the pipelines may need to be upgraded, especially their compressors and valves.A safe, dependable and cost-effective transportation is essential to the wider adoption of green hydrogen in the country. Hydrogen is extremely reactive and its flames are invisible in daylight. It has a very low energy density \u2013 at atmospheric pressure, a litre of hydrogen holds about 0.003 kWh of energy compared to 9.4 kWh in a litre of petrol.Currently, Indian refineries produce as much hydrogen as they need. Production of green hydrogen would saddle refiners with additional volumes, for which they must find a market. Without an adequate transportation facility \u2013 either as gas in the pipeline or liquefied hydrogen in tankers \u2013 the refiners may have to curtail existing fossil fuel-based hydrogen capacity to accommodate green hydrogen.The government is also discussing plans to impose green hydrogen purchase obligations on several sectors including refining, fertiliser, city gas, steel and power sector in phases. Green hydrogen should make up 10% of the overall hydrogen requirements of refiners in three years, increasing to 25% by the end of the decade, as per a government proposal.State-run refiners want the government to set an overall target for the company and not mandate site-specific purchase obligations as every refinery site doesn\u2019t have adequate land to build green hydrogen plants.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s ambitious plan to cut the use of fossil fuels by promoting ethanol derived from rice, corn and sugar is drawing criticism from some experts who warn the move could undermine food security in the world\u2019s second-most populous country.In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration accelerated the nation\u2019s ethanol goal by five years, seeking to double production and to have gasoline 20% blended with the spirit by 2025. To help meet the target, the government is offering financial assistance to biofuel producers and faster environmental clearances. The plan is also resulting in the diversion of food grains meant for the poor to companies at subsidized rates. Even as many developed countries debate limiting policy support for grain-based biofuels amid reports of food-price increases and greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, India is seeing multifold benefits. The government argues that the new target will help the world\u2019s third-largest oil consumer save 300 billion rupees ($4 billion) annually by cutting crude imports, reduce carbon emissions and boost farmers\u2019 incomes. But critics say it\u2019s a self-goal for a country that\u2019s struggled for years to feed its poor. Though the Green Revolution helped boost farm yields and turn India into a net exporter of wheat and rice, it still ranks 94th on the Global Hunger Index 2020 comprising 107 nations. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 209 million Indians, or about 15% of its population, were undernourished between 2018 and 2020. The coronavirus pandemic is also pushing more people into poverty, dealing a blow to decades of progress.\u201cIt will always be the poor who will be affected worse as a result of diverting precious food grains to alternative energy conversion,\u201d said Shanthu Shantharam, who helped formulate the country\u2019s biotechnology regulations in the 1990s and now teaches agricultural biotech at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. \u201cAs it is, the food security situation in the country is precarious.\u201dThe report that maps out the new ethanol blending target primarily focuses on food-based feedstocks, with the government saying the program is a \u201cstrategic requirement\u201d in light of grain surpluses and wide availability of technologies. Yet the blueprint is a departure from the 2018 National Policy on Biofuels, which prioritized grasses and algae; cellulosic material such as bagasse, farm and forestry residue; and, items like straw from rice, wheat and corn. \u201cIndia has a real opportunity here to become a global leader in sustainable biofuels policy if it chooses to refocus on ethanol made from wastes,\u201d said Stephanie Searle, fuels program director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. \u201cThis would bring both strong climate and air quality benefits, since these wastes are currently often burned, contributing to smog.\u201dThe new ethanol policy should ensure that it doesn\u2019t drive farmers toward water-intensive crops and create a water crisis in a country where its shortage is already acute, said Ramya Natarajan, an energy researcher at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, a think tank in Bengaluru. Rice and sugar cane, along with wheat, consume about 80% of India\u2019s irrigation water. \u201cWith our depleting groundwater resources, arable land constraints, erratic monsoons, and dropping crop yields due to climate change, food production must be prioritized over crops for fuel,\u201d Natarajan said.A ton of corn can typically produce about 350 liters of ethanol, while a similar quantity of rice can yield about 450 liters of the spirit.Even in the U.S., food-versus-fuel fights have flared intermittently. Some say the domestic fossil-fuel industry\u2019s embrace of climate-friendly fuels has diverted corn and soy meal used to bulk up chickens and hogs, and made them more expensive. For instance, demand for soy oil has pushed futures up about 80% in the past 12 months, while the fast-food industry has complained of paying more for everyday items such as mayonnaise. These days, many developed countries are focusing more on electric vehicles to cut carbon emissions. The Biden administration\u2019s infrastructure proposal has set aside $174 billion of investments in EVs, including subsidies, but relatively little for biofuels. India, which is also seeking to promote EVs, shouldn\u2019t focus on both policies at the same time as they aren\u2019t complementary, said Kushankur Dey, chairman of the Centre for Food and Agribusiness Management at the Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow. The push for ethanol poses no threat to India\u2019s food security because the government has enough stockpiles of grains at warehouses of the state-run Food Corp. of India, said Sudhanshu Pandey, the top bureaucrat at the food ministry in New Delhi.\u201cThe long-term planning of the government involves the creation of sufficient capacities so that half of the requirement of 20% blending is catered by grains, predominantly maize and the rest by sugar cane,\u201d Pandey said. State reserves stood at 21.8 million tons of rice as of Sept. 1, against a requirement of 13.54 million tons, according to the food ministry. The blending plan would benefit corn and rice farmers, while addressing the issue of surplus, Pandey said. Some critics are concerned that food grains meant for the impoverished are being sold to distilleries at prices cheaper than what states pay for their public distribution networks. Many ethanol producers are getting rice at 2,000 rupees per 100 kilograms (220 pounds), which compares with an estimated 4,300 rupees Food Corp. of India pays to stock up the grain. \u201cCompetition between the distilleries and the public distribution system for subsidized food grains could have adverse consequences for the rural poor and expose them to enhanced risk of hunger,\u201d said Prabhu Pingali, professor of applied economics and director of the Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition at Cornell University.",

It was formed to own and operate captive power plants for SAIL's steel manufacturing facilities located at Durgapur, Rourkela and Bhilai.According to the source,the Rs 15,000 crore divestment plan is as per agreed targets of performance set by the company with the Ministry of Power which includes listing of NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd(NTPCREL), North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd(NEEPCO)and NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd(NVVNL)by March 2024.The source said that the listing of NTPCREL is expected by October next year.NTPCREL,a 100 per cent subsidiary of NTPC Ltd,currently has a renewable project portfolio of 3,450 MW of which 820 MW projects are under construction and 2,630 MW projects have been won for which PPAs(power purchase agreements)are pending to be executed.NTPC had incorporated NTPCREL with the Registrar of Companies, NCT of Delhi & Haryana on October 7,2020,to undertake renewable energy business.The listing of NTPCREL assumes significance in view of the ambitious plan of the company to have 60 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2032.The RE installed capacity of the firm would be 45 percent of the 130 GW envisaged by 2032.Earlier,the company had planned to have a minimum of 32 gigawatt(GW)capacity through renewable energy(RE)sources constituting nearly 25 percent of its overall power generation capacity by 2032.The present installed capacity of NTPC Group is 66,900MW(including 13,425MW through JVs/Subsidiaries) comprising of 47 NTPC stations (23coal-based stations,7 gas-based stations,1 hydrostation,1 small hydro,14 solar PV and 1 wind-based station) and 26 joint venture stations(9 coal based,4 gas based,8 hydro,1 small hydro 2 wind and 2 solar PV).The source said the equity component of the NTPCREL would be around Rs50,000 crore and rest of the requirement would be met through long-term loans,debentures, bonds and other such modes.The plan to have 60 GWRE capacity by 2032 would entail an investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore.The other arm which the company wants to list is NEEPCO,in which it had acquired 100 per cent equity stake held by the Government of India(GoI)on March27,2020, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.NTPC had acquired NEEPCO for Rs4,000 crore. Another arm which would be listed on the bourses is the NVVN, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of NTPC.It was incorporated on November1, 2002 for carrying out the business of purchase and sale of all forms of electrical power, both conventional and non-conventional, venturing into RE, E-Mobility and Hydrogen Mobility.",

        "articleBody": "India and its 450 GW renewable energy target figure prominently in the US government's 'Energy Compact' and is part of its climate ambitions formally submitted to the United Nations at the September 22-23 high-level dialogue on energy.'Energy Compacts' are voluntary commitments from UN member states, setting out actions planned to advance clean, affordable energy for all by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.Over 130 Energy Compacts have been submitted so far by a range of stakeholders, including India and the United States.Citing the September 2021 agreement between the United States and India through the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership, the US Energy Compact document states that it will harness a diverse set of resources, spanning a network of US laboratories to help emerging economies like India transition to clean energy and go towards a 'global net zero transition.' Major emerging economies are projected to drive global emission growth absent urgent action in this critical decade through 2030 to curb emissions,  according to the US Energy Compact.  An example of urgent action includes rapidly ramping up renewable energy in India's power sector between now and 2030, an essential element of that economy's energy transition and of a global net-zero transition. In addition to its ambitious 2030 renewable energy goal, India has also set an interim goal of 175 gigawatts of installed renewable energy capacity by 2022,  it added.The US administration has said that helping accelerate the clean energy transition in India will set 'an example for promoting rapid clean energy transitions and economic development in emerging economies around the world.'The US is increasingly supportive of India's 450 GW target as an ambitious move towards addressing the climate crisis. Its Special climate envoy John Kerry also recently nudged India to include it as part of its target/ Nationally determined contribution in the upcoming COP 26 climate talks.\u201cIndia is the third-largest energy consumer and its domestic greenhouse gas emissions account for more than seven percent of the global total, the third most behind China and the United States,\u201d it said. \u201cAn encouraging sign is that India is setting a global example for emerging economies on renewable energy deployment, having achieved 100 GW of installed renewable capacity through 2021. Keeping the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius alive through 2030 is dependent, in part, on India acting urgently this decade to rein in emissions, including through achieving its target of 450 GW of renewable energy, which the United States is committed to supporting India in achieving,\u201d it added.The US government elaborated that it would support energy transitions in major emerging economies, such as India, Indonesia, and South Africa, to \u2018increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix\u2019 by 2030.The India-US climate agenda and its two components \u2013 the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership and the Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue launched recently in New Delhi with US Special climate envoy John Kerry -- are cited as examples of the kind of bilateral action planned.\u201cThe Agenda 2030 Partnership will promote US-India bilateral collaboration to help India reach its 450 GW renewable energy goal by 2030. The Partnership will support the development of ambitious climate targets and roadmaps, foster collaboration on clean energy innovation and deployment, mobilize investment in clean infrastructure, and enhance India\u2019s capacity to measure, manage, and adapt to climate change,\u201d the Energy Compact pointed out.The 450 GW target also figures prominently in India\u2019s own Energy Compact submitted to the UN. India has said that a cumulative investment of Rs 17,00,000 crore ($221 billion) is required to set up 450 GW renewable generation capacity, including the associated transmission and storage systems.The ambitious renewable energy target is estimated to create 700,000 new jobs in India.",

The transport department is including a fleet of 390 electrical buses this year.The government has decided to replace the scrapped buses with e-buses. Every year as many as 400 buses are scrapped in the state.Along with the push from the Central government, the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) considering the increasing pollution levels and skyrocketing fuel prices have decided to acquire e-buses.As part of the larger scheme, a mini electrical bus acquired under Smart City Project will be plied in Bengaluru on an experiment basis. As many as 90 buses will be added to the Bengaluru Metropolitan Corporation (BMTC) in a phased manner by November. Chief Minister Basavarj Bommai will inaugurate the services, Transport Minister B. Sriramulu explained.These 90 buses will be acquired under the Smart City project at a cost of Rs 50 crore. National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) will take care of the maintenance of these buses for 10 years. BMTC will pay Rs 51.62 per kilometre. The cost of the driver, maintenance and charging will be borne by NTPC. The transport department has also signed an agreement to ply Electric buses for a minimum of 180 kilometres per day as Metro feeder service in Bengaluru.The buses need to be charged after plying 120 kilometres and it will take 45 minutes for a bus to complete charging. Presently, the electric bus will be put into service at Metro stations in Bengaluru to different locations.Sriramulu explained that the electric bus experiment is being done for the first time in the state. These vehicles are a necessity to avoid pollution. In the month of November, 90 mini electric buses (9 meters long) will be put into service and these buses can run on narrow roads of the city.The BMTC board is also considering the purchase of 300 electric buses (12 meters long). A decision in this regard will be taken soon, Sriramulu added.Rajendra Kumar Kataria, the Principal Secretary to Transport department said, e-bus ticket prices will be lesser than the normal buses. Mainly, there will not be noise pollution and the emission of smoke. The BMTC will acquire 90 e-buses in the first phase and 300 buses in the second phase.The Central government is encouraged to bring about  electric culture  in the public transport system under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (Fame-2) project in 9 cities. They have asked for the list of the required number of buses. In the coming three years there will be a bid for 1,500 buses. Every year 600 e-buses will be added to the transport and about 30 to 40 per cent of people would be commuting through e-buses, he explained.Under the Fame-1 scheme, e-bus services within the city will be provided. In the second phase (Fame -2) it has been agreed to start intercity e-bus services, he said.BMTC Managing Director Anbukumar explained that the cost of a diesel bus is Rs 30 lakh and e-bus would cost Rs 90 lakh. Smart City project funds have been utilised. Since BMTC does not have the experience, the company has been asked to look after the maintenance of these buses. Every year as many as 400 buses are being scrapped and they will be replaced with e-buses.",

        "articleBody": "In an interview with ET Now, Somesh Kumar, Partner & Leader - Power, EY, talks about looking at renewables, power sector reforms, focus on distribution, and growth with ESG compliance.What could be the India connect, given that we have seen a weak(ish) monsoon, the reopening of industries, coming off from pandemic woes and you are seeing an escalated power demand?We saw the pandemic period where demand had really gone down significantly. The economy was not looking good and everybody was talking about what is going to happen next. From that we have come to a situation where we see the demand going back to normal. In fact, much more than what it used to be in certain cases. Economy is picking up. Things are looking quite buoyant.For the power sector, things are looking back to normal. They are looking good as we see them right now. The whole focus is going back to renewables but given international and national challenges, the question on going back to coal and 'net zero' is under question mark. But again as we see right now, demand is back up. The focus is on bringing about increased capacity into the sector particularly renewables.I also see a lot of emphasis on reforming the distribution sector. You must have seen the latest power sector reforms, the revamp scheme that came out. That is focussing on the much needed distribution sector once again. Given some precondition, some benchmarks, I think that is a good scheme and I see a lot of states coming forward to subscribe to the scheme and get benefits under that scheme, commit to modernisation and the improvement of the distribution network.That is the leg of the power sector, that is the biggest impact creator for the whole sector and I think the right moves are being taken as of now. The only thing is that the states should design this right kind of scheme for themselves which is reliable, authentic and then follow it for four-five years. So I think both on the generation front as well as on the distribution front, we are taking the right steps to reform the sector and in turn cater to the economy. I am quite hopeful about the power sector going forward.We talk about ESG, China wanting blue skies ahead of the Winter Olympics, we have images of how the Chinese are using flash lights at night and also the coal shortage. The ESG entry barrier in India, can that become a problem? The government has enacted a lot of reforms and the market is still understanding them. Where are we lacking and then what is that going to mean as far as investments go?ESG is certainly a very important requirement of today\u2019s time. Besides the legal and the regulatory framework, I think there is a lot of push which each and every organisation. Each and every responsible corporate is moving towards it whether it is in power sector or elsewhere. I do not personally see that as a bottleneck in the growth journey.We definitely need to be more environmentally, socially aware and conscious of what we are doing. I would not like to comment on some of the things that China is doing and whether those are environmentally responsible or not. But I think as far as India is concerned, I think, what we are trying to do is to enable our growth and at the same time be more ESG compliant.Some of the larger companies, for instance, some of the larger coal companies or some thermal power based companies are also looking at ways and means to improve their environmental footprint. So I think all in all, everything may not be accomplished at one go but given the thrust and the focus that we have on ESG, I strongly believe that we can have good growth journey with ESG compliant systems. I am quite hopeful on that as well.",

We are going to make it mandatory for all vehicle manufacturers to make flex-fuel engines (that can run on more than one fuel),  the road transport and highways minister said.The minister cited examples of Brazil, Canada and the USA where most automobile companies manufacture flex-fuel engines vehicles. We have submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court. When we get the permission of the Supreme Court, then we will make it mandatory for all vehicle manufacturers to make flex-fuel engines,  Gadkari said in his address at PHDCCI annual session on Thursday.Flex-fuel, or flexible fuel, is an alternative fuel made of a combination of gasoline and methanol or ethanol.Gadkari further said that the government is working to develop an ethanol economy and 450 companies have shown interest in manufacturing it. He suggested that the military should also ban the use of diesel engine vehicles and use trucks which run on LNG, CNG and ethanol.The minister pointed out that ethanol was much cheaper than petrol and diesel.Delhi air pollutionGadkari said his had spent Rs 60,000 crore on road infrastructure development -- an effort that also helped in reducing air pollution in Delhi.  Air pollution, water pollution and noise pollution are major concerns for the country. We will make Delhi free of air, water and sound pollution in the next three years,  he said.Gadkari said the road ministry is working on a proposal to shift all container depots and 1,700 godowns out of Delhi. In the next 15 days, we will be discussing that proposal with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi Development Authority (DDA),  he said. Gadkari also said that the road ministry is also building logistics parks worth Rs 1 lakh crore.The minister said he had put forth his suggestion to Kejriwal to run only electric buses for the public transport purpose in Delhi.",

        "articleBody": "Maharashtra Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday said the state government is planning a series of consultations with stakeholders on the seamless implementation of the recently announced electric vehicle policy. The minister, earlier in the day, visited the premises of Pune-based electric vehicle maker Kinetic Green Energy and Power Solutions Ltd to assess the potential and for further growth of the electric vehicle space, according to a statement.  The Maharashtra government had in early July announced its new electric vehicle (EV) policy with an aim to have a 10 per cent share of the electric vehicles in total registrations by 2025.  The state government, under the updated version of the EV policy announced in 2018, also wants to achieve a 25 per cent EV share in public transport in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik.  The policy includes converting 15 per cent of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation fleet into EVs by 2025, besides intending to make the state the top producer of battery-driven vehicles in the country in terms of annual production capability.   Aggressive implementation of the EV policy is critical. The Government of Maharashtra is planning a series of stakeholder consultations to ensure that any issues on the ground are addressed rapidly for smooth implementation (of the policy),  the statement quoted Thackeray as saying.  The minister also reiterated the commitment of the state government to implement EV purchase schemes by the state government for various applications such as bus and car purchases and also electric vehicles for waste management as well as for tourism, it said.  Maharashtra is a leading automobile manufacturing hub in the country; and in the backdrop of the new EV policy for the state, it is keen to become a leading state for electric vehicle manufacturing and deployment.  The policy envisages sops for manufacturing electric vehicles and components, charging ecosystem creation and incentives to electric vehicle buyers. Under the policy, state government departments will also be mandated to procure electric vehicles for their requirements, Kinetic Green Energy and Power Solutions said.  A pioneer in the EV manufacturing space in the country, Kinetic Green has a robust in-house government-approved R&D centre. It offers a wide range of EVs, including e-three-wheelers for passenger as well as cargo applications, e-two-wheelers and a range of e-smart carts, including golf cars and buggies for tourism.  Kinetic Green founder and CEO Sulajja Firodia Motwani said,  Kinetic Green is committed to promoting electric vehicle technology as well as skill development in Maharashtra.   Motwani added that Kinetic Green plans to invest Rs 300 crore in electric two- and three-wheelers as well as golf car model development and capacity expansion in Maharashtra, at its EV manufacturing facilities in Ahmednagar and Pune districts over the next few years.",

        "articleBody": "The power ministry on Wednesday announced redesigning of the renewable energy certificates (REC) mechanism which would pave the way for removal of floor as well as forbearance price limits for these instruments.  Union Minister of Power and New & Renewable Energy, R K Singh has given his assent to amendments in the existing Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) mechanism,  the ministry said in a statement.  The intent behind this decision is to align the mechanism with the emerging changes in the power scenario and also to promote new renewable technologies, it added.  The proposed changes will provide some flexibility to the players, additional avenues, rationalisation and also address the RECs' validity period uncertainty issues, the ministry stated.  Extensive stakeholder consultations have been held towards drawing up these changes.  The ministry had circulated a discussion paper on redesigning the REC mechanism on June 4, 2021.  Under the redesigned mechanism, the validity of the REC would be perpetual, that is till it is sold.  Besides, the floor and forbearance (maximum) prices are not required to be specified.  The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will have a monitoring and surveillance mechanism to ensure that there is no hoarding of RECs.  The renewable energy (RE) generators eligible for RECs will be eligible for the period of the power purchase agreement (PPA) as per the prevailing guidelines.  The existing RE projects that are eligible for RECs would continue to get them for 25 years.  A technology multiplier can be introduced for promotion of new and high priced RE technologies, which can be allocated in various baskets specific to technologies depending on maturity, it added.  The RECs can be issued to obligated entities (including discoms and open access consumers) which purchase RE power beyond their renewable purchase obligation (RPO) compliance notified by the Centre.  No REC will be issued to the beneficiary of subsidies/concessions or waiver of any other charges. The FOR (Forum of Regulators) will define concessional charges uniformly for denying the RECs.  It will also allow traders and bilateral transactions in REC mechanism.  The changes proposed in the revamped REC mechanism will be implemented by the CERC.  To address mismatch between the availability of RE sources and the requirement of the obligated entities to meet their renewable purchase obligation (RPO), a pan-India market-based REC mechanism was introduced in 2010.",

        "articleBody": "Niti Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant on Tuesday called upon all private sector players to focus on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and become green companies of the future which would help them access capital at low rates. The private sector and industry is an extremely important partner to meet the country's sustainable development goals and the government needs their support to translate policies into actions, he said.  I wish all the private sector together to focus on the Sustainable Development Goals and become green companies of the future. Those companies will grow and prosper, their valuation will rise, and they will get capital at low rates if they become green and digital,  he said. Kant was speaking at one of the virtual sessions of a day-long SDG Summit. The summit saw participation from heads of various companies across sectors. He said to meet the targets under the SDG framework on time, India needs to progress faster on nutrition, learning outcomes, women's active participation in the economy, employment for all and reducing pollution. The government has already rolled out various initiatives in these areas and has established a system to monitor and review the progress, he said. Kant also urged Indian companies to invest into innovation and research and development (R&D).  If we do not start investing in commercially focussed R&D immediately, it will be very hard to survive in the global economy,  he noted. Kant said the country has made the global pledge as part of its nationally determined contributions to have 40 per cent of cumulative electric power installed capacity from non fossil fuel sources.  Our renewable energy sector becomes the prime destination for global investors with the potential to attract USD 10 billion of annual investments,  he said. He said the country is increasing its investments in domestic manufacturing capacity of batteries, electric vehicles and solar. Speaking at a session on 'ESG investing: The big question', Bank of America President and Country Head Kaku Nakhate said the cost of implementing ESG (environment, social and corporate governance) may be slightly high in the short term, but it evens out in the longer term. She said Bank of America has been actively encouraging supply chain financing based on meeting the ESG targets.  So we do run programmes on supply chains, where we assist the company that when their suppliers really meet the ESG targets, we actually discount their trade at a little more discount, so that the interest rates come down,  Nakhate said. World Bank Group's Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer Anshula Kant said there is a need to have a global approach to sustainable finance.  The share of emerging markets, sustainable debt is still at about 40 per cent of total global flows. So a global approach to sustainable finance is very much needed. And investors' behaviour is changing,  she said. Addressing a session on 'CEO's Panel: Leadership Matters: How the C-Suite is seizing the ESG Opportunity' in the morning, Godrej & Boyce Chairman and Managing Director Jamshyd Godrej said there is a very strong business case for going green.  I think you will see that the effort that goes in will result in better products and less expensive ones over time,  Godrej said. He said Godrej Group started a programme - 'good in green', about 10 years ago to manufacture products that are more energy efficient, less polluting and more recyclables.",

        "articleBody": "The Covid pandemic has squeezed funds for achieving Agenda 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the challenge is not to lose the momentum by ensuring continued funding, top diplomat T S Tirumurti said on Tuesday. Tirumurti, India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said the pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted decades of developmental progress on many fronts, pushing billions into poverty. This has caused the most damaging humanitarian and economic crisis since World War Two, especially for the more vulnerable countries, he said.  The pandemic has effectively squeezed the funds available to achieve Agenda 2030 in this decade of action and diverted them for more pressing humanitarian requirements,  Tirumurti said while addressing the SDG Summit, 2021, virtually. However, this shortfall has not been made up by any other source, he noted.  The challenge is therefore not to lose towards the momentum of Agenda 2030 that seeks to attain Sustainable Development Goals.  We need to ensure continued funding from multiple sources and bring in digital innovations and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) to incentivise multiple stakeholders towards the same goal,  Tirumurti observed. When discussions on SDGs took place and they were finalised, an important principle was kept in mind -- it was to preserve the balance between the environment, social and economic pillars. Subsequently, when the SDGs were discussed in the context of pathways to achieve them, there was a need to be conscious about maintaining this balance and not tilt excessively towards the environment or the economic side, he said.  When the world is reeling under the pandemic, we need to recover better by focussing on all the three pillars and not just on one in exclusion to the other. Otherwise, it will be self-defeating,  Trimurti said. He asserted that India is walking the talk on SDGs and has set an example about ways to localise them. For the successful implementation of the Agenda 2030, especially in a country like India with a population of 1.3 billion, a holistic, coherent, and integrated approach at the sub-national, national and regional level is imperative, Trimurti said. He added the Niti Aayog is coordinating this aspect and developing SGD Vision Document at sub-national and local levels.",

        "articleBody": "In recent months, India\u2019s biggest private sector players have made ambitious clean energy commitments. Reliance India Ltd announced clean technology investments worth Rs 75,000 crore; ArcelorMittal pledged Rs 19,000 crore for solar power; and Adani Green raised Rs 9,570 crore in debt financing. Backed by India\u2019s billionaires, these announcements herald a new chapter of clean energy expansion in our country. But why aren\u2019t our energy public sector undertakings (PSUs) also at the forefront of India\u2019s energy transition?PSUs continue to play a vital role in India\u2019s energy sector and the wider economy. Energy sector PSUs account for seven of India\u2019s 10 Maharatnas \u2014 firms that have an annual turnover of more than Rs 25,000 crore. Over 50 per cent of the country\u2019s power generation is publicly owned. Just two PSUs produce around 90 per cent of the country\u2019s coal output. Publicly-owned oil marketing companies are responsible for 57 per cent of refining and almost all retail distribution. Since independence, these companies have been vehicles of nation-building, creating millions of jobs and generating revenue for the government. But as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, India\u2019s energy majors, unfortunately, continue to invest in them.A recent report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) estimated that the seven major energy-related Maharatnas invested in 183 projects with a total value of Rs 2.4 lakh crore between FY14 and FY20. However, their total investments in renewable energy (excluding large hydro) stood only at Rs 25,000 crore\u2014ten times less than their fossil fuel investments.Further, these seven PSUs had a combined capital expenditure (CAPEX) of INR 1.4 lakh crore in FY20 alone. While a breakdown of this CAPEX is not available, public announcements indicate that it goes largely toward expenses linked to coal mining, oil and gas exploration and refining, and thermal power generation.Winds of changeSome PSUs have recognised the need to adapt and have begun to respond. The most notable example is NTPC Limited, which arguably has the best business case for diversification and has set a target of 60 GW of net renewable energy capacity by 2032. Likewise, GAIL has a greenhouse gas emission reduction target and Coal India Ltd is considering getting into solar wafer manufacturing. Green hydrogen, too, has seen interest from India\u2019s oil marketing companies. For instance, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) has announced plans to build the nation\u2019s first green hydrogen plant at its Mathura refinery.Still, PSUs are showing far less ambition than their private sector competitors and risk falling behind. If India is to meet its national energy transition and decarbonisation targets, PSUs must step in with big money commitments towards clean energy. There is also a business case for doing so.First, energy PSUs should take advantage of their strong balance sheets, which enable them to raise capital at favourable rates. They should also keep in mind that global investment trends have started moving away from fossil-intensive projects. The U.K. has decided to stop financing overseas fossil fuel projects, and the U.S. is looking to follow suit. The world\u2019s biggest fund manager, Blackrock, has announced plans to divest from fossil fuel assets and put sustainability at the core of its business model. These developments indicate that companies with fossil-intensive portfolios will increasingly struggle to access foreign capital.Second, energy PSUs that fail to divest quickly enough are likely to be saddled with stranded fossil fuel assets, face rising capital costs, and suffer falling returns. They could also lose out on opportunities to attract lucrative Environmental, Social, and Governance investor funds, which are expected to reach a value of INR 350 lakh crore globally by 2025. Third, energy PSUs have a mandate to deliver socially desirable outcomes, a requirement that distinguishes them from their peers in the private sector. From their inception and until recently, PSUs received priority access to natural resources in exchange for promising to improve the quality of life of Indian citizens. Their business decisions will continue to affect the lives of millions.The central government has a key role to play in persuading PSUs to increase investments in clean energy. It has already instructed them to increase their capital expenditure to support India\u2019s post-COVID-19 economic recovery. But it must also provide a clean energy mandate in line with national targets, with a focus on actively curbing dependence on fossil fuels and scaling up new technologies like green hydrogen, offshore wind, and non-fossil, clean cooking.No state-owned enterprise from a developing economy has managed to successfully navigate the ongoing transition to a low-carbon future. But that should inspire rather than discourage India\u2019s energy PSUs. They have the social capital, political access, and financial strength to become world leaders in energy transition.",

        "articleBody": "In what may come as a boon for people aspiring to ride on their own electric vehicles, the government is looking to extend the provisions of its subsidy scheme FAME II to the buyers of passenger cars meant for personal use.Government sources said that they were also looking at including electric bicycles under the capital subsidy scheme seeing its growing popularity and the need to bring down its cost for customers.The fresh inclusions would make the running Fame II or Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV scheme all encompassing covering the entire range of electric vehicles being used both for personal and commercial use and public transport.At present the Fame II scheme benefits covers only electric two-wheelers, three wheelers, four-wheeled passenger vehicles and goods carrying vehicles. Under it, vehicles are provided with demand incentives that help to bring down its purchase price. FAME 2 had increased the benefit offered from Rs 10,000 per kWh to Rs 15,000 per kWh. That's a hike of 50 per cent.The maximum subsidy cap is also increased to 40 per cent of the e-two-wheeler cost compared to 20 per cent earlier while the scheme is now running till March 31, 2024, from the earlier closure of March 31, 2022.Sources said that for passenger cars purchased for personal use and e-bicycles the government may come with a revised benefit structure. But nothing on this has been worked out yet.The SCALE committee or Steering Committee for Advancing Local Value-Add and Exports, a joint government-industry panel tasked with fast-tracking growth of the Indian manufacturing sector, has also batted for providing demand incentives for electric bicycles. In its report to the commerce ministry, the committee headed by Mahindra & Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka, has recommended FAME like incentive of Rs 5000 per unit for e-bicycles to reduce its cost at least by Rs 3,000.The FAME II scheme, introduced to drive greater adoption of EVs in India, was launched with a budget outlay of Rs 10,000 crore in April 2019, to support 7,000 e-buses, 5,00,000 e-three-wheelers, 55,000 e-passenger vehicles and a million e-two-wheelers.As of now, about 1,24,415 vehicles have benefited under the scheme. This includes 99,652 electric two-wheelers, 23,059 electric three-wheelers and 1,693 electric four-wheelers. In terms of state-wise registrations, Karnataka (25,725 EVs), Tamil Nadu (19,222 EVs), Maharashtra (13,384 EVs), Uttar Pradesh (7,990 EVs), Rajasthan (10,010 EVs) and Delhi (8,897 EVs) are the leading states to avail benefits under the scheme.",

        "articleBody": "Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he and his Indian counterpart and  dear friend  Narendra Modi have agreed on some important new initiatives, including low emissions technology partnership and ultra low cost solar programme, which will help in further deepening the economic ties between the two countries.The meeting between Modi and Morrison held here on Thursday came a week after they spoke over phone and reviewed the rapid progress in the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, including through the recent 'two-plus-two' dialogue, and exchanged views on regional developments and the forthcoming Quad meeting to be hosted by US President Joe Biden later in the day.The Quad or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue comprises India, the US, Japan and Australia. I've just come from a meeting with one of my Quad partners, Prime Minister Modi, a dear friend and great friend of Australia. We've been working together for some years now. Today, at our meeting, we were able to agree on some important new initiatives,  Morrison told journalists after the meeting, a transcript of which was released by his office on Friday. At our meeting today we agreed to go forward with a low emissions technology partnership, a partnership that will focus on hydrogen development, ultra low cost solar programs, to support their energy transition,  he said.India currently has the world's fastest-growing solar energy programme and has expanded access to clean cooking fuel to cover over 80 million households, making it one of the largest clean energy drives globally.One of the key points, Morrison said, they continue to make about addressing climate change is to ensure that there is a technology transfer from developed to developing economies. If we want to address climate change, then we need to address the change that is necessary in developing economies, so they can grow their economies, build their industries, make the things the world needs. And, to do that, you need an energy economy that supports those objectives. And so, we'll work together closely with our good friends in India, to work with the comparative advantages that Australia has, particularly in the area of hydrogen, and working together with their manufacturing capabilities so they can realise that in their own country,  he said.Replying to a question on the possible impact of the AUKUS deal on the dynamics between the Quad members during its upcoming meeting, Morrison said Australia is engaged in partnerships with many countries, and it sees the Quad and the trilateral partnership of AUKUS as being completely complementary. And that's the discussion that Narendra Modi and I have just had. He certainly sees it in that way, as does Yoshi Suga (Japanese prime minister), when I spoke to him last week...The Quad partners understand the need for positive contributions to regional stability and the AUKUS partnership is all about making that sort of contribution,  he said.Everybody gains from a stable Indo-Pacific, including whether it's in China, Japan, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, all will benefit from a stable Indo-Pacific, Morrison asserted.At the invitation of President Biden, Prime Minister Modi and his counterparts Morrison from Australia and Yoshihide Suga from Japan have gathered in the American capital for the first-ever in-person Quad summit at the White House.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers.AUKUS (Australia, the UK and the US) security partnership was unveiled last week by President Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Morrison. The trilateral security alliance, seen as an effort to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, will allow the US and the UK to provide Australia with the technology to develop nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.Morrison said he had the opportunity to discuss with Modi the recent announcement on the AUKUS agreement and Australia's programme to put in place a nuclear-powered fleet of submarines. Of course, I spoke to Prime Minister Modi the night before we made the announcement in Australia last week (on AUKUS),  he said.The meeting between Morrison and Modi was the first since the unveiling of the AUKUS security partnership. Australia has said its decision to join the security alliance with the US and the UK is aimed at developing capabilities that can contribute along with India and other countries in deterring behaviour that threatens the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific.France reacted angrily to the formation of the new AUKUS alliance as it resulted in Paris effectively losing a multi-billion dollar deal to build 12 conventional submarines for Australia. France is also upset over its exclusion from the alliance.China has also slammed the formation of the AUKUS.Morrison said he and Modi also had a  very good discussion  on the Australia-India defence partnership, which  particularly progressed at the most recent 2+2 meeting .Noting that Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan will be meeting his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in New Delhi next week, Morrison said he and Modi have tasked  our teams to be ambitious when they sit down next week to look at our trade opportunities, particularly in the area of digital trade arrangements. Responding to a query on whether his discussions on critical minerals with Prime Minister Modi will translate into more jobs for Australians, Morrison said the issue of pursuing critical mineral supply chains  of course  means more jobs for Australians. Of course it does, but it does more than that. Because critical minerals supply chains means that the partners we work with around the world also have access to trusted supply chains on critical minerals. I mean, these are the things that will power up our economies in the new energy economy. And critical minerals and rare earths, of which Australia is already very active in producing in these areas, we want to ensure that we're connecting that up right through the supply chain, through production, through to end users, and Prime Minister Modi and I share a passion around that project, because they are also involved in that supply chain at various different points, and it's important that we have the choice that exists in world markets around these issues,  he said. We want to play a stronger role here. But...to develop those critical minerals and rare earths opportunities...we need to ensure that the downstream users are caught in a very productive and trusted supply chain,  Morrison said.Meanwhile, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi in New Delhi on Thursday termed the meeting between Modi and Morrison as \u201canother chapter in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Australia\u201d.\u201cAdvancing friendship with Australia. PM @ScottMorrisonMP held talks with PM @narendramodi. They discussed a wide range of subjects aimed at deepening economic and people-to-people linkages between India and Australia,\u201d Office of Prime Minister Modi tweeted on Thursday.During the meeting, the Prime Ministers discussed a broad range of issues of bilateral, regional and global importance. They noted with satisfaction the regular high-level engagements between the two countries, including the recently held first India-Australia Foreign and Defence Ministers' 2+2 Dialogue.In a press statement, the MEA said Modi and Morrison reviewed the progress achieved since the Leaders' Virtual Summit in June 2020 under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and resolved to continue close cooperation for mutual well-being and towards advancing their shared objective of an open, free, prosperous and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.They expressed satisfaction at the ongoing negotiations on a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).The prime ministers underlined the need for the international community to address the issue of climate change on an urgent basis. Prime Minister Modi highlighted the need for a broader dialogue on environment protection. Both leaders also discussed possibilities of providing clean technologies,  the statement said.Modi and Morrison agreed that as two vibrant democracies in the region, India and Australia need to work closer together to overcome the challenges in the post-pandemic world, inter alia to enhance supply chain resilience.Both the leaders lauded the immense contribution of the Indian diaspora to Australia's economy and society, and discussed ways to enhance people-to-people ties.Modi also renewed his invitation to Morrison to visit India, the statement said.",

        "articleBody": "As one of the world\u2019s most water-stressed countries, India faces a massive challenge every day to deliver safe drinking water to a population of close to 1.8 billion people. And when one considers that it is home to 18% of the world\u2019s population but has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources, a radical rethink of how it manages its water resources is urgently needed. Change is needed to tackle some of these challenges, and solutions may be within reach. Located in the northwest of Saudi Arabia, NEOM is tearing up the playbook to drive change on how water should be processed, treated, and managed. Instead, NEOM is planning to build a sustainable water ecosystem founded on the principles of the circular economy and smart connected infrastructure. And underpinning this ambition is a commitment to zero liquid discharge (ZLD) into the environment, minimizing the cost of water production while maximizing its impact and benefit for the planet\u2019s future.NEOM is part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 plan for the future of the Kingdom. It is a new model for exceptional livability, creating thriving businesses, and reinventing environmental conservation. And there\u2019s much for a country like India to observe and consider when it comes to NEOM\u2019s radical thinking regarding water. Recognizing that a new approach to water processing and sustainability is required, NEOM plans to adopt a regenerative approach to water processing that will focus on preserving natural reserves and rejuvenating natural groundwater sources. As part of its strategy, NEOM intends to use innovative technology and renewable energy to produce entirely carbon-free products, while promoting a systematic understanding of circularity by maximizing the potential of water through desalination and seawater mining, more commonly referred to as brine processing.NEOM is progressing several water projects to support its water ambitions, which will come to fruition soon. These include a state-of-the-art water desalination plant that produces zero liquid discharge and captures brine for utilization in numerous ways and a water research centre to determine innovative uses for brine, such as creating new materials for building and product manufacture. In addition, NEOM is exploring new ways of using concentrated solar power (CSP) to develop new desalination approaches. 86473161Gavin van Tonder is Executive Director for Water at NEOM and the man tasked with helping bring NEOM\u2019s water strategy to life. Commenting on how NEOM will tackle some of the most pressing issues facing the world\u2019s water industry, he said: \u201cNEOM is pioneering new ways to convert seawater, wastewater, and the air\u2019s moisture into freshwater \u2013 ensuring no-one goes without it. What we plan on doing at NEOM will fundamentally change the world\u2019s approach to water processing from being a resource we just take out of the ground to a regenerative approach that supports sustainability and benefits both humans and the planet.\u201dVan Tonder adds that providing safe drinking water to the world\u2019s growing population is now a global problem. \u201cAt NEOM, we are committed to utilizing the best minds and latest technology to achieve 100% recycling of wastewater, creating a smart and connected water infrastructure, and investing in innovative water solutions that benefit the world and doing so in.\u201dWith NEOM leading the way in building a sustainable water future for the planet, India now has a global reference point to find equally innovative ways to solve its water problems.",

        "articleBody": "Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said India is committed to an eminently achievable clean energy-based economy, and added that the country will soon have a policy for flex-fuel engines.  The road transport and highways minister further said India is shifting its public transport fleet to green fuels like bio-CNG, ethanol, methanol, electricity and green hydrogen, which will also provide citizens some respite from surging petrol prices.   India is committed to an eminently achievable clean energy-based economy, through an annual road-map for production, supply of ethanol till 2025-26, and systems for its countrywide marketing,  he said while addressing a virtual event of industry body CII.       Gadkari said his ministry is in talks with automakers for flex-fuel engines and for using biodiesel and LNG in the construction equipment industry.             We will soon announce a policy for flex-fuel engines. This policy will encourage automobile manufacturers to produce such engines,  he said.  The minister pointed out that India is one of the fastest-growing economies leading through sustainable and climate-neutral development.  While the government is focusing to create an investor-friendly ecosystem to promote domestic manufacturing,  parallelly we are also giving importance to infrastructure development,  he said.               As expected, India is gaining good momentum in the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem, he noted.        There is a good response for battery operated small electric vehicles like e-scooter, electric three-wheelers, e-rickshaws, e-carts, and e-bikes in the country,  he said.     The minister added the road ministry is also planning to run a railway, metro, and long-run intercity buses on green hydrogen.   Both battery electric vehicle and fuel cell vehicle technologies are complementary to each other and are all set to overtake fossil-run automotive by 2050 in the country,  the minister said.  He further said India's fuel energy security can be well supported by the agriculture sector as it provides opportunities for concepts such as waste to wealth and waste to energy, ultimately leading to the benefit of all.  Both Brazil and India are stepping ahead on the sustainable energy roadmap, he pointed out.   Gadkari said India is committed to meeting the Paris Climate Agreement targets, where efforts are centered to reduce carbon emissions by 33 - 35 per cent by 2030.  The minister said necessary steps are being taken to decarbonise the transport sector by reducing the harmful green house gas (GHG) emissions.",

        "articleBody": "India's long-awaited transition to electric vehicles is finally gaining traction. The increased attention on electric vehicles is largely because of two factors: to combat the rising menace of air pollution, and reduce India\u2019s over dependence on crude oil imports. Moreover, support to domestic R&D, tax cuts, subsidies on import of raw materials and other incentives are also acting as catalysts in this transformation. As the market is becoming more competitive, it is imperative to think what it will take to make the price-conscious Indian buyer switch to an electric vehicle. The three major questions that remain in most buyers\u2019 minds are purchase price parity with fossil-fuel vehicles; benefits in operational and maintenance cost; and finally, range or the availability of adequate charging infrastructure.The average cost of an electric vehicle has remained higher than conventional ICE options but recent incentives towards manufacturing and increased availability of essential component through suppliers, are helping EV manufacturers to produce affordable electric solutions. India has efficiently scaled up battery manufacturing under the \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative and will soon become the hub of battery manufacturing. The increasing interest from foreign investors will pave the way for all-round growth.The Indian government is trying to push domestic manufacturing by incentivising local production, and disincentivising the import of EVs. Additionally, the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises has announced a 50% increase in incentives for electric two-wheelers to Rs 15,000 per kilowatt-hour from Rs 10,000 per kWh. As per the new rules, the cap on incentives will be limited to 40% of the total price compared to the earlier cap of 20%. It has also mandated Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) to procure 3 lakh electric three-wheelers for different uses. These decisions will drastically help the manufacturers to cut the cost of electric models and will make them more achieve parity with petrol / diesel vehicles, and in some cases, even cheaper than them!The FAME II stimulus has been helpful in the growth of organised 3-wheeler EVs as it reduces the high sticker-price of 3-wheelers that run on Li-ion batteries. The cost difference between the commonly-in-use lead-acid battery and the more advanced Lithium-ion is usually between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000 for a 6kWh \u2013 12kWh battery. But the incentives under FAME II on Lithium-ion battery EVs reduce this price difference quite effectively.So far, the advantages of owning electric vehicles have remained hidden. The reality is these electric solutions are far more cost efficient and sustainable in the long-run for an average Indian buyer who wishes to go for pocket-friendly variants. For example, if 10 units of electricity are required to fully charge a cargo electric 3-wheeler sufficient to deliver a range of 100 kms, then at an average cost of Rs 6 a unit, a day\u2019s work can be completed for Rs 60. As compared to this, the diesel version with a mileage of 20 km per ltr at an average price of Rs 90 per ltr would take around Rs 450 to cover the same distance, thus making EVs over 80% cheaper to operate. Also, the maintenance cost of an EV is lower than an ICE vehicle as it doesn't run on complex combustion engines or moving parts. Road-ready EVs only require infrequent checkups of electrical systems, including the battery, motor and electronic components, which helps reduce the maintenance cost by approximately 40% as compared to ICE vehicles. The Indian government has already laid out its vision with a target of 30% electric vehicles on the road by 2025. It is already working to provide the required amount of charging infrastructure and has approved setting up 2,636 electric vehicle charging stations across 62 cities in 24 states and union territories of India under the second phase of FAME India scheme. It has also directed developers to set aside 20 percent of parking space for EVs in all residential and office projects that will greatly solve the challenge of charging infrastructure for EV owners.Purchasing price parity with ICE vehicles, coupled with the benefits of long-term operational costs advantages of EVs, are being promoted among potential buyers to boost the latter\u2019s adoption rate. In addition to financial reasons, the rise of conscious Indian buyers who are aware of their environmental responsibilities is also driving the growth of EVs in India.",

There was strong focus on the country\u2019s 450 GW renewable energy target as it would help India to go ahead towards holding the 1.5-degree Celsius commitment. Interacting with journalists in New Delhi on Tuesday, Kerry said he urged India to include it as part of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in the upcoming COP26 climate talks. \u201cWe did not spend a lot of time on net zero\u2026we talked about it and nobody suggested that it wasn\u2019t fair discussion to be having but the key is \u2014 and what we really focused on \u2014 is now. If we don\u2019t do enough in 2020-2030, net zero is not achievable... the 450 GW modeling shows that if India achieves that, it is on track to target to hold off the 1.5 degrees,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cI personally urged the government to announce that as part of the NDC because to do so is really to help other countries realise that nations are stepping up in significant ways and trying to make a difference.\u201dThe US government wants to work very closely with India to help accelerate the deployment of 450 GW target renewable energy\u2019 as it is a very ambitious goal and would be a major contribution by a developing country.On whether he urged India to raise its climate ambitions for COP26 talks, Kerry said that while he felt confident that India would announce ambitions, it is ultimately the PM\u2019s prerogative to announce ambitions and internal deliberations need to be made on the same. Everybody needed to raise ambitions and India was already ahead of a lot of countries in its efforts, he said.\u201cEverybody can contribute and I am not suggesting that everybody has to do what developed countries are doing... The discussion I had here was less about \u2018you have got to do this\u2019 or \u2018you have got to do that\u2019 and more about how do we work together\u2026 to raise ambition,\u201d Kerry said.",

        "articleBody": "State-run refiners want the government to set moderate green hydrogen purchase targets as they fear steep obligations could leave their recently-built grey hydrogen-producing facilities partly redundant and hurt their monetisation plan, according to people familiar with the matter.The government is currently discussing a slew of steps, including imposing green hydrogen purchase obligations on several sectors including refining, fertilizer, city gas, steel, and power in phases. A government proposal requires green hydrogen to make up 10% of the overall hydrogen requirements of refiners in three years, increasing to 25% by the end of the decade.State-run refiners want green hydrogen obligation to rise to no more than 10% by 2030, as per industry executives and officials. Companies have told the petroleum ministry that accelerated adoption of green hydrogen would cut utilisation of their existing grey hydrogen-producing facilities, leading to the destruction of economic value. Grey hydrogen is produced by splitting natural gas, which also results in carbon emissions while green hydrogen is produced by splitting water using renewable energy and leaves no unwanted emission. 86181832State oil companies have spent thousands of crores of rupees in the last few years on setting up grey hydrogen plants in their refineries as part of the government mandate to upgrade fuels to match BS-VI specifications, which required sharply lower sulphur content in petrol and diesel compared to BS-IV standards. Hydrogen is used to suck sulphur from fuels at refineries. The obligation to switch to green hydrogen would cut return on refiners\u2019 past investments and saddle them with new investment obligations, an official said. A 10% green hydrogen obligation would boost prices of petrol and diesel by about 50 paise a litre, an official said, citing a ballpark industry estimate.Declining capacity utilisation would also impede Indian Oil Corp\u2019s plan to sell some of its hydrogen-producing units, an industry executive said. \u201cThe prospect of fading revenues would naturally hurt investor sentiment,  an executive said.State-run oil companies also do not have adequate land at each refinery to build green hydrogen plants and so want an overall purchase obligation for the company and not a site-specific mandate, the people cited above said.The ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE), which is leading the green hydrogen policy effort in the country, Niti Aayog and some other arms of the government are hoping that a big push by India can sharply cut green hydrogen production costs and contribute to the reduction in imports of oil, gas and ammonia.For the fertilizer sector, switching to green ammonia isn\u2019t going to be as hard as refiners since the government provides subsidies on fertilizers.The government hopes to create a substantial market for green hydrogen in the country so that purchase obligations can be ended after some years. To help build a robust green hydrogen value chain, the government aims to intervene at multiple levels, including offering production-linked incentives to electrolyser manufacturing, and viability gap funding for use of green hydrogen in heavy mobility.",

India is already the cheapest place to put together a solar unit and could soon be a global leader in manufacturing clean energy products. This was an example of how a switch to clean energy can generate new jobs and create a new economy, he said.Kerry also drew attention to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which had clearly shown that the world had little time to course correct. This is Kerry\u2019s second visit in less than six months. Kerry is at the forefront to a global effort to have most big nations declare a net zero target to be achieved by 2050. India is yet to announce a net zero goal. Kerry emphasised on the need for a net zero target by 2050. This was not \u2018a matter of politics but of arithmetic and physics\u2019 given the blanket of greenhouse emissions engulfing the planet. Among examples of climate change consequences, Kerry also cited the heavy rainfall that lashed Delhi recently. ",

Power and new and renewable energy minister R K Singh on Monday met a delegation led by John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate to discuss further collaboration on climate change issues and to work towards a genuine partnership between the two countries to pave the way for the rest of the world on Energy Transition, an official statement said.Singh told the delegation that large bids for green hydrogen and electrolysers are planned in the upcoming months. He also told the US side about the government\u2019s intent to move towards clean energy transition. He further said that the biggest challenge for infusing of renewable energy was storage, which needs to be addressed immediately to make power accessible to the masses. Singh also highlighted India\u2019s upcoming projects in Ladakh on green hydrogen and green energy corridors, the statement said.Jerry said the US is willing to enter into a genuine collaboration with India to enable it realise the target of reaching 450 GW renewable energy by 2030, which would pave the way for India to meet commitments made under Paris Climate Agreement.",

        "articleBody": "When he bought a construction contractor called Weber Electric in 2018, Josh Mosier inherited about 20 employees. By the end of the next year, he was up to about 100 employees. By the spring of 2021, the number was over 225.  Because of this boom,, said Mosier, whose company often works on large building projects,  we've grown exponentially., The epicenter of that boom is an electric-vehicle-maker named Rivian, which brought in Mosier's company and others in the Normal, Illinois, area to work on the city's costliest construction project in decades: a massive auto plant. As it prepares to deliver its first electric pickup trucks and SUVs this year, Rivian has spent around $1.5 billion renovating and expanding a factory once owned by Mitsubishi. On a typical day, the 3.3-million-square-foot plant hosts several hundred construction workers alongside more than 2,500 workers employed by the company, which expects to eventually double its local head count. The effects are hard to miss in Normal and nearby Bloomington, a metropolitan area of about 170,000. Hotels are frequently booked up, pandemic or not; hundreds of housing lots are being developed; and many employers looking to hire a full-time plumber are basically out of luck.  At Rivian, we've heard they're hiring a lot of licensed plumbers,, said Lori Stickling, who operates a plumbing company with her husband.  We've had a post up for months with no qualified candidates., In recent years, makers of electric vehicles and their components, like Tesla, Lucid Motors and Lordstown Motors, have collectively spent billions building or renovating factories in Nevada, Texas, Arizona and Ohio. The challenges are enormous, given that few of these companies have brought a vehicle to market. But if some succeed, the impact could be many times greater than the thousands of manufacturing jobs they create directly. They could transform places like Normal, a university town where high-paying blue-collar employment lagged until the late 1980s, when Mitsubishi partnered with Chrysler to build a factory. The plant, which employed more than 3,000 at its peak, and its suppliers attracted workers from across central Illinois. The resulting economic activity helped fill the city's coffers and fund redevelopment. When the plant scaled back production in the 2000s and closed in 2015, around the time of white-collar job cuts, Normal felt the pinch. Suppliers decamped, and many workers left in search of new jobs. Uptown, an elegant, brick-accented district with a restored 1930s theater and a pair of suddenly too-big hotels, became a monument to the city's fading prosperity. Local politicians and business leaders embraced Rivian, which is based in Michigan and has locations in other states, Canada and Britain, as a way to fill the vacuum. But in a place that has endured such changes of fortune, residents can be forgiven for wondering how long today's good times will continue. Electric vehicles require fewer workers to make than gasoline-powered ones. And while Rivian's prospects appear strong - it filed for a public stock offering in August, seeking a valuation of roughly $70 billion - the company could be overwhelmed by a growing list of competitors. At some point, the spending spree will end, and the local industry will rise or fall on whether Rivian can build a sizable customer base. The initial froth is already dissipating. After reaching more than 200 employees earlier this year, Weber Electric is down to about 100.  We kind of rolled it back a little bit,, said Mosier, the owner, adding that he hopes to add workers again as the plant green-lights more construction. In this way, the electric vehicle boom is something of a microcosm for the larger transition to a low-carbon economy: As governments and investors funnel hundreds of billions of dollars into green industries, there is certain to be an initial jolt. But will it last?  'It's Really Saved Their Bacon' Not everyone in Normal has a connection to the Rivian plant, the company's only production facility; it just feels that way sometimes. Sitting in a lobby at the plant one afternoon in June, Katy Tilley, who helps oversee workplace operations like site design and dining, said her younger sibling, who had just left the Marine Corps, was starting at the company the next week.  My younger brother works in the battery department!, her colleague Laura Ewan, a community relations employee, chimed in.  We were so different, our parents would have never expected us to work in the same place.,Hiring began in 2016, when Rivian kept on a handful of former Mitsubishi employees who had been maintaining the shuttered factory, but it has accelerated in the last 1 1/2 years. The company hired about 100 people a week in June and July. The ramp-up has made labor, already in short supply during the pandemic, even more scarce. A branch of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which has helped contractors like Mosier staff up, says it has fully booked the roughly 280 licensed union electricians in the area. To meet the demand, the union brought in a few hundred electricians from elsewhere in the country this year. A nearby community college started a program this fall to train electric vehicle technicians, and Illinois State University, which abuts Uptown, is building an engineering school partly in response to Rivian. The boom has also sustained the local travel and hospitality business. In October, after a four-year hiatus, Delta Air Lines resumed a nonstop flight to Detroit. The visitors, including contractors, suppliers and Rivian employees from other locations, have helped keep the city's restaurants and hotels afloat during the pandemic.  It's really saved their bacon,, Mayor Chris Koos said. One indication of their reliance on Rivian: The company runs a shuttle service to and from a stop near the hotels from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.In principle, a factory like Rivian's should provide a more lasting boost than a solar or wind farm, which creates a flurry of construction activity but requires relatively few employees to operate. An automobile factory could also provide a bigger stimulus than an e-commerce warehouse because its workers tend to be more productive and can therefore be more highly paid. Such factories also attract more suppliers, said Willy C. Shih, an expert on manufacturing at the Harvard Business School. Despite this potential, new factories do not benefit all cities equally. When a factory opens where much of the population is already employed, the net gain to the local economy can be muted, according to research by Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Michigan. But in an area like Normal that is suffering industrial decline, a factory's effect on employment can be up to three times as great. The benefits can last for decades - if the factory survives.  When the employment-population ratio is going up, it drives up earnings, and that goes on for 20 years,, Bartik said.A Virtuous Cycle In 2010, about 65% of working-age people in the Bloomington-Normal area were employed, according to the Census Bureau, far higher than the national average of 57%. By the eve of the pandemic, however, the local employment rate had fallen just below the national average, which had recovered to about 60%. One contributor to the decline was the shuttering of the Mitsubishi plant, originally known as Diamond-Star Motors. The 2015 announcement blindsided workers, some of whom were hired only weeks before, and took a financial toll on veteran production workers, whose hourly pay had once been in the upper $20s. The closing also wiped out suppliers and squeezed local restaurants and retailers.  We had restaurants close by,, said Bob Dobski, who owned several McDonald's franchises in the area.  We definitely saw diminished traffic., Around the same time, State Farm, whose headquarters is in Bloomington, was shrinking its local workforce. The real estate market wilted. In 2016, an auction company was preparing to sell the Mitsubishi plant in pieces. After executives from Rivian came to scout equipment, the company's 38-year-old founder, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology doctor named R.J. Scaringe, decided that the plant itself was the real find.  It was like, 'How much for the whole thing?', Scaringe recalled. The company barely had a website, much less a product. When it asked for tax subsidies before it completed the $16 million purchase, local government officials were not entirely convinced that the company was for real.  We gave them a list of things we need,, said Mark Peterson, then the city manager. The list included such rudiments as the names of board members and a photo of a prototype. The company responded to roughly half the requests, Peterson recalled. (Both he and the company said Scaringe later provided more information at a Town Council meeting.) The city and other local authorities approved a package of tax abatements and grants worth up to $4 million in any case, realizing it had no other option for reviving the plant, but skepticism lingered. In 2019, however, the company raised nearly $3 billion from the likes of Ford Motor and Amazon, which also ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks. That fall, Rivian held a public curtain raiser in Normal for its $70,000 trucks, which it says can get to 60 mph in about three seconds.  To a lot of people in the community, it was the first solid touch they'd had with Rivian,, said Koos, the mayor.  There was a lot of excitement., Workers at the nonunion plant start at $20 an hour and top out at $23 after three years - less than at unionized plants owned by General Motors and Ford, but more than the typical wage in the Bloomington-Normal area. For the local economy, the suppliers attracted by Rivian may be as important, part of a virtuous cycle that can pull in workers from the margins of the labor force. A few could end up at a recently revived industrial park near the Rivian plant. More than a decade ago, a civil construction firm called Stark Excavating took over an unfinished 500,000-square-foot structure there. But last year, Stark Excavating sold the building to a real estate investment firm, which finished construction and leased it to Rivian, then began work on a second 500,000-square-foot building to be used by suppliers or Rivian itself.  That's all attributable to Rivian - they're driving this town,, said David Stark, Stark's president.  It reminds me of when Diamond-Star Motors built that original car plant that was taken over by Mitsubishi. It's what made Bloomington-Normal grow.,",

        "articleBody": "Govt plans to restrict its Rs 26,000 crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for automobiles to green technologies such as electrics and futuristic hydrogen fuel cells, eschewing petrol and diesel vehicles. The original scope of allocation was Rs 57,000 crore over five years, starting 2022-23, which has now been reduced, government sources told TOI.The scheme could be announced as early as next week and is likely to be a dampener for auto companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Honda, Toyota, Renault-Nissan, Skoda-VW and many others that derive all their sales from petrol/diesel cars. Pursuing electric and other clean technologies for many years, homegrown companies Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra will stand to gain. Centre believes that restricting incentives for green vehicles would prompt automakers to urgently focus on getting electric and other sustainable technologies to the market instead of waiting for a mega customer transition.The auto PLI scheme will also provide benefits to auto components that are aimed at making vehicles green, including those engaged in hybrid energy storage systems, collision warning gear, EV parts, automatic braking and blind spot detection parts, advanced driver assistance systems, and sensors of certain categories, sources told TOI.The revised draft is focused on the new-age clean automobiles as part of the government\u2019s aim to leapfrog into the next generation of green, connected and smart vehicles. Several of the existing players are currently seen as reluctant to switch over to EVs as they look to maximise value of their investments in operational plants.Incentives for green technologies will fuel a significant growth in the share of hydrogen and battery-electric vehicles, the Centre argued.With several international majors seen to be transitioning to electrics, the government is hoping to tap into what it believes will be a booming business in the coming years.

        "articleBody": "India and the US have agreed to expand their energy partnership by adding emerging fuels to the list of areas of cooperation that previously included power and energy efficiency, oil and gas, renewable energy and sustainable growth, an official statement said. This followed a ministerial meeting of the US-India Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) on Thursday evening.   Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri co-chaired a virtual ministerial meeting with US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm to launch the revamped US-India Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP),  a statement from the oil ministry said.  The SCEP was launched in accordance with the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden at the Leaders' Summit on Climate held in April this year.   The two sides announced the addition of a fifth Pillar on Emerging Fuels, which signals joint resolve to promote clean energy fuels,  it said.  It further added that  a new India-US Task Force on Biofuels was also announced to build on the scope of work on cooperation in biofuels sector.   With this, the SCEP inter-governmental engagement now spreads across five pillars of cooperation -- Power and Energy Efficiency, Responsible Oil and Gas, Renewable Energy, Sustainable Growth and Emerging Fuels.  The statement said, minister Puri and the Secretary reviewed the progress, major accomplishments, and prioritized new areas for cooperation under the various pillars.   The meeting also reviewed the progress on the India-US Civil Nuclear Energy cooperation,  it said without providing any details.   Minister Puri emphasized that the revamped clean energy partnership will intensify the efforts from both sides to take advantage of the complementarities that exist between the US and India - advanced US technologies and rapidly growing India's energy market, for a win-win situation through a cleaner energy route with low carbon pathways,  it said.  After the revamp, there would be considerable emphasis on upscaling cooperation under the renewable energy pillar by working on several projects and system-friendly practices in India's renewable energy sector.   The US Secretary lauded India's renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030, and offered to closely collaborate in realization of this target by India,  the statement said.   Both sides will strengthen the electric grid in India to support large-scale integration of renewables, including through smart grids, energy storage, flexible resources, and distributed energy resources, and ensure reliable and resilient grid operations, as well as promoting energy efficiency and conservation measures,  it added.  The two sides also announced rechristening of Gas Task Force to India-US Low Emissions Gas Task Force, which would continue to forge collaboration between the US and Indian companies on innovative projects to support India's vision of a gas-based economy.  The two sides also agreed to continue to develop better understandings on methane abatement under this Task Force.  Both sides have initiated institutionalization of India Energy Modeling Forum with the constitution of Six Task Forces for carrying out research and modeling in different areas. Joint Committees have been set up to deliberate on Energy Data Management, Low Carbon Technologies and Just Transition in the Coal Sector.  Building on the success of the first phase, the two sides agreed to expand the scope of the work to include smart grid and grid storage as part of the second phase of the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy (PACE)-R initiative anchored on the Indian side by the Department of Science & Technology.",

        "articleBody": "The upcoming COP 26 on climate change should ensure a balanced outcome with equal treatment to all agenda items such as finance and response measures, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said on Thursday. His remarks came in a meeting with Denmark's Minister of Climate, Energy and Utilities Dan Joergensen. The 26th conference of parties (COP 26) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is scheduled to be held in Glasgow, Scotland in November.  After the meeting, Yadav tweeted that he had an engaging and fruitful discussion with his Danish counterpart.   I thanked him for the efforts of the Kingdom of Denmark in the renewable energy sector, especially for the cooperation in setting up the Offshore Clean and Wind Energy Hub in Tamil Nadu,  he tweeted.  The two ministers discussed general bilateral cooperation between India and Denmark in the areas of environment and climate change, the environment ministry said.  Reinstating the findings of the IPCC Physical Science Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) released recently, Yadav emphasised that  COP 26 should ensure a balanced outcome with equal treatment to all agenda items like adaptation, finance and response measures.   Minister Dan Jorgensen is on five-day visit to India with a business delegation.  In the meeting, Yadav acknowledged the historical and friendly ties between the two countries and highlighted the contributions of Denmark in the 'White Revolution' in India, because of which, today India is the largest producer of milk in the world, the ministry said.  Both the ministers held discussions on Green Strategic Partnership (GSP) and the upcoming COP 26 meeting, it said.   Yadav stated that India and Denmark may explore strengthening bilateral cooperation especially on climate change, clean energy, circular economy, and resource efficiency,  according to the ministry's statement.

        "articleBody": "Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh on Thursday met his Danish counterpart Dan Jorgensen where both agreed on further engagement in renewable energy, especially offshore wind and green hydrogen.  Union Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy R K Singh met with Dan Jorgensen, Danish Minister for Climate, Energy and Utilities, here today (Thursday),  the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said in a statement.  Both the ministers agreed to further engagement in renewable energy, especially offshore wind and green hydrogen, it added.  In the meeting, from the India side, Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy Bhagwanth Khuba, MNRE Secretary Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi and other senior officials of the ministries of power and MNRE were also present.  The Danish minister was also accompanied by a delegation of officials.  Singh underlined to the Danish side that energy transition towards green is an important part of India's policy.  He pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech has set a target of 450 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030.  The minister went on to say that already our whole renewable energy portfolio is at 146 GW.  He stated that India is the only G20 country whose actions are in consonance with the Paris Climate agreement with regard to the global rise in temperature.  Discussing the potential of green energy, Singh said India is looking at making Ladakh and islands such as Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep green in energy including transport.  The two ministers jointly launched the 'Centre of Excellence on Offshore Wind' as part of the Green Strategic Partnership.  This Centre will at the outset be centred around four working groups, including spatial planning, financial framework conditions, supply chain infrastructure and standards, and testing.  In the initial phases, the centre of excellence (CoE) will focus on the offshore wind sector.  In the medium to long term, the vision is that the Centre will broaden to include a wider group of international governments and players, accumulating experience and best practices on offshore wind and become an international centre for offshore wind and with broader links to new and renewable energy.  Both sides agreed to further their cooperation in renewable energy with a focus on offshore wind energy.  The two countries already have an agreement on 'Strategic Sector Cooperation in the field of Renewable Energy with a focus on Offshore Wind Energy'.  The Danish minister also invited Singh to Denmark to take a first-hand look at Denmark's work in offshore wind energy.",

        "articleBody": "An arm of Rockfeller Foundation, Smart Power India (SPI), and GIZ joined hands with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) to elucidate the role of decentralised renewable energy for the overall development of the nation, according to a statement.   In a bid to encourage decentralised renewable energy (DRE) for the country to be Atmanirbhar, Smart Power India (SPI), a subsidiary of the Rockefeller Foundation and Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) joined hands with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, to elucidate the role of DRE for the overall development of the nation,  the statement said.  This partnership came as part of the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, which was celebrated on Thursday.  The Mahotsav saw various departments and ministries hosting a set of activities for a resurgent Atmanirbhar Bharat.  It is projected that in 2050, about half of India's population will still be living in rural areas. India's economic development is tied to improving rural per-capita incomes.  Hence, it said the story of India's economic development is incomplete without improved per-capita income in rural areas. This means a continued opportunity for decentralised renewable energy (DRE) and energy efficiency (EE) innovations.  The Indian government's electrification plans, which predominantly focus on household electrification, have been complemented in two ways. Firstly, product innovations for livelihood applications, which can use electricity efficiently and effectively. Secondly, DRE-powered innovations that can bridge gaps in the centralised electricity supply system and which can power income-generating activities in rural areas.  At a webinar, Shobhit Srivastava, a scientist at MNRE, said that in the past few years, constant interventions by the ministry and its partners have helped various stakeholders develop schemes for mini-grids and other projects. This has had an impact on residential and commercial avenues, particularly for areas that are difficult to access such as the northeastern region and economically backward sections of Orissa, he added  He said community-level intervention has become important at the rural level to ensure clean energy systems.  Nidhi Sarin, programme head at GIZ, said the combined efforts of all stakeholders have ensured that Indian villages are no longer in the dark.  She added that GIZ has been fortunate to be a part of this process, working in collaboration to make access to electricity a reality in the country.  She said the emphasis now needs to be on achieving India's sustainable energy targets along with equitable access to electricity for all.  However, to achieve this, a significant increase in annual investments will be required.  The increment in the level of investment will only be possible by including significant changes to India's existing DRE policy framework.  Samit Mitra, senior director (programme implementation) of Smart Power India, said the congregation witnessed the evolution of SPI's journey of the past six years, and the evolving landscape of rural electrification in India through the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav.  He mentioned how the new and innovative technologies developed are going beyond conventional uses like lighting to creating livelihoods at the local level and powering other critical functions for communities.  DRE-powered ecosystems unlock socio-economic co-benefits by impacting sectors such as healthcare, education, livelihoods and irrigation.  He also said that with nearly 500 mini-grid plants set to become operational soon, SPI is re-doubling its efforts to realise its vision of providing reliable electricity to 25 million people, while also assisting the government in its efforts to provide '24x7 Power for All' to its citizens.  The key speakers in the webinar included Manoj Gupta, CEO of TP Renewable Microgrid; Subhendu Goswami, head (customer acquisition and business development) at Husk Power Systems; and Vijay Bhaskar, managing director of Hamara Grid.  The webinar also saw presence from six community members from Bihar.",

        "articleBody": "To add two lakhs electric vehicles in next five years, Assam government has come up with Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam,2021.The government has set a target to convert 100% of the public transport bus fleet into electric buses (Battery Electric Vehicles) by 2030 besides all Government vehicles to be converted to electric vehicles by 2030.After 2025, only Electric Vehicles will be allowed to purchase and phase out all fossil fuel based commercial fleets and logistics vehicles in all cities by 2030.According to the policy, the population of over four million vehicles on the roads in Assam has made mobility a challenge. Further, huge numbers of vehicles plying from the neighbouring states as well as from other parts of the country add to the vehicular population resulting in road accidents and air pollution. Assam chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma recently said that the state government will procure 200 electric buses and 100 CNG buses for public transportation in Guwahati to reduce carbon footprint.Sarma said in the long run government plans to incentivise private operators to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.The policy stated adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) for road transport contributes to a wide range of goals.These include better air quality, reduced noise pollution, enhanced energy security and in combination with a low carbon power generation mix - reduced greenhouse emissions.The Government of India has created momentum through its Faster adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme that encourages, and in some segments mandates the adoption of electric vehicles (EV), with a goal of reaching 30% EV penetration by 2030. At the end of FAME Phase-I, the electric vehicle penetration remained low in Assam.The Assam government after deliberating on it found that a dedicated strategy to address price of EVs, public charging infrastructure and investment in EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure is required to promote adoption of EVs in the state. Government plans to ensure a robust infrastructure for electric vehicles that includes adequate power availability, network of charging points and favourable power tariff.This policy will seek to drive rapid adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in a manner where they contribute to 25% of all new vehicle registrations by 2026. The Demand Incentive from the State will be over and above any subsidies that are available from the Central Government through its promotional schemes and policies.According to the policy the maximum amount of subsidy should not be more than the 40% of the ex-factory price of the vehicle. Exemption of registration charges and road tax on Electric Vehicles for 5 years besides 100% Waiver on parking charges.The State Government will promote charging infrastructure of different capacities/ technologies and promote a variety of businesses.All provisions of the Industrial & Investment Policy of Assam,2019 or provisions under any subsequent Industrial Policies declared by the State Government will be applicable to enterprises intending to set up facilities for manufacturing in the EV sector and All provisions of the North East Industrial Development Scheme (NEIDS),2017 or provisions under any subsequent industrial policies for North Eastern Region declared by the Central Government will be applicable to enterprises intending to set up facilities for manufacturing in the EV sector.

        "articleBody": "The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday approved two proposals for setting up multiple solar power plants with total capacity of over 550 MW with financial help from a German bank, and also cleared a mega housing redevelopment project in Mumbai. The first proposal, involving 187 MW capacity, envisages setting up solar units near the sites of existing thermal power plants, an official release issued after the state cabinet meeting said. These solar power plants will be funded by Germany's state development bank KfW which will provide Rs 588.21 crore, while Mahagenco power firm of the state government will raise Rs 158.29 crore through share capital as well as other sources, it said. KFW has already funded a similar project in Dhule district of Maharashtra. The second proposal, also involving Mahagenco, was cleared by the cabinet to raise Rs 1,564.22 crore from KfW at an annual interest rate of 0.05 per cent, the release said. The state power utility has to repay the loan in 12 years, while the government will raise Rs 364.18 crore from its own sources, it said. The second proposal involves setting up solar plants with total installed capacity of 390 MW. These units will come up at independent sites and also near existing thermal power facilities, the release said. The cabinet also cleared a proposal of redeveloping MHADA (Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority) colonies in Motilal Nagar in suburban Goregaon where 5,300 houses are located at the present. Post-redevelopment, there will be additional 33,000 flats in the colonies, the release said. Though the MHADA has to complete the project as per an order by the Bombay High Court dated October 17, 2013, the housing authority has decided to appoint an agency to carry out the work due to its inability to handle such a huge project, said the statement.",

        "articleBody": "A proposal for setting targets for purchase of green hydrogen by refineries and fertiliser plants has been sent to the Cabinet for approval, Power and Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said on Wednesday. He also said the government is mulling a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and viability gap funding for use of the clean fuel by heavy vehicles to promote green hydrogen.  'Green hydrogen' is produced using renewable energy.   We have drawn up a Cabinet note (proposal) and sent it to the Cabinet for placing mandates for use of green hydrogen.... Those mandates' total requirement (is) of up to 8.8 GW of electrolyser capacity,  Singh said.  He was delivering the keynote address at CEEW's virtual event 'A Multilateral Approach to Building a Global Hydrogen Economy'.  The minister said the government is considering green hydrogen purchase obligations for refineries and fertiliser plants, starting with 10 per cent which will be increased to 20-25 per cent.   With time, by adding more and more volume, the price will reduce and the mandate will no longer be required,  he noted.  About promoting use of green hydrogen for long-haul vehicles, he said,  We are also proposing to come up with viability gap funding (VGF) for green hydrogen in heavy mobility and are also eyeing other sectors such as steel (for hydrogen purchase obligation).   Singh said India is the world leader in energy transition and intends to continue leading the path.  India's NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) target is to increase the share of non-fossil fuels to 40 per cent of the total electricity generation capacity by 2030. In fact, at the current rate, India might be able to achieve almost 50 per cent non-fossil fuel share by 2030, he added.  India has achieved a milestone of 100 GW of installed renewable energy capacity.  This not only marks an important milestone in the country's journey towards its target of 450 GW by 2030, but also builds upon the confidence to achieve more and be among the leading countries embarking on a path towards energy transition globally, he stated.   We would like to come out with a PLI for setting up electrolyser capacity. The electrolyser capacity which we need is in the region of 15 GW.   We can start with 10 GW. Without that (scale or volume) we are not going anywhere because available electrolyser capacity in the world is very limited,  he pointed out  An electrolyser is a device which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electrical energy.  The minister was of the view that with economies of scale, the price of hydrogen will come down.   When we started solar, it was too expensive. But we believed that by adding volumes, the prices would come down. Similarly, we are starting off with (large) scale for hydrogen,  he said.  Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of CEEW, said,  India is poised to play a vital role in the global hydrogen economy. Many countries in the tropics, including India, are favourable locations for lower-cost green hydrogen production.    The recently announced National Hydrogen Mission has also provided a timely boost. Scaling up green hydrogen could be a game-changer for India's heavy industries, such as steel, ammonia and petrochemicals, in addition to long-distance freight transport and energy storage,  he added.  The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) is a leading not-for-profit policy research institution.",

The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Power Minister R K Singh on an action plan for enhancing the investment by power sector Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) in renewable energy projects on Tuesday.   A meeting to discuss the action plan for enhancing the investment by power sector CPSEs in renewable energy projects, was held under the chairmanship of R K Singh, Union Minister of Power & NRE yesterday,  the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.  Representatives of all hydro CPSUs, NTPC, MNRE (Ministry of New & Renewable Energy) and SECI (Solar Energy Corporation of India) were present at the meeting.  According to the statement, it was decided that in-principle approval would be accorded to CPSUs of the power ministry for bidding of renewable energy power projects at the beginning of a year for a pre-determined capacity based on the strength of their balance sheet.  The matter of enhancing the power of investment approval of the boards of mini ratna CPSUs would be taken up with the Department of Public Enterprises.  The proposal for reducing hurdle rate IRR (Internal Rate of Return) for renewable energy sector from 10 per cent to 8 per cent would be taken up with the finance ministry, as per the statement.  On policy and regulatory issues, it has been decided to allow bundling renewable energy projects with new or untied/high tariff hydro projects to bring down the tariff of hydro power for consumers.  According to the statement, it has been decided to consider the proposal for waiver of transmission charges for renewable energy capacity under flexibility scheme.  There will be no requirement for separate PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) for renewable energy power projects developed under the flexibility scheme.  Also, separate guidelines would be formulated under Section 63 of The Electricity Act, 2003, for bundling scheme, for setting up renewable energy plant on their own land or a new location.  With respect to allocation under CPSU scheme, the ministry said,  it was deliberated to allocate the offered capacity amongst CPSUs through bidding process in some form on equitable basis .  The MNRE would examine allowing solar power park developer/ individual promoters to participate in TBCB (Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding) process and a separate policy would be formulated for floating solar by the MNRE, the statement said.  Besides, the MNRE would evolve mechanisms to ensure sanctity of the bidding process and PPA by the state government and for rationalizing high Solar Park charges.",

As more electric vehicles are coming up, electricity recharge centres will be opened all over the state. We have given responsibility to various Electricity Supply Companies (ESCOMs) to open recharge centres at the district centres and tourist centres,  Kumar told reporters at the BJP state headquarters Jagannath Bhavan in Bengaluru. Speaking about the energy demand by farmers, he said there was a demand for continuous seven-hour power supply to agricultural pumps. In this regard, more than 60 sub-stations will be built in 100 days by the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) to enable continuous electricity supply for agricultural pumps. The minister said he has drawn a 100 days programme to provide electricity to households in the rural areas where there is no access to electricity. This will be implemented under the 'Belaku' project (Light), as per the wish of the chief minister. Kumar said his department will also set up 'Transformer Bank' to change the defective transformers. This bank will be used to replace the damaged transformers in just 24 hours. The minister who also holds Kannada and Culture portfolio said the trend to apply for the Rajyotsava Award should be discourage so that the tradition of identifying the achievers across the state should start. Kumar also explained the plans to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of India's independence by telling the people of the state about the contribution of Karnataka, its villages and people in the freedom struggle.",

This is aimed at contributing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda of a hydrogen-based economy in a clean manner.   Ministry of Coal has constituted 2 Committees today, one to oversee the program and another of experts to give guidance to the Ministry,  the coal ministry said in a statement.  The task force has been constituted under the chairmanship of Coal Additional Secretary Vinod Kumar Tiwari. Its broad terms of reference include monitoring of activities towards achieving coal-based hydrogen production and usage and coordination with Coal Gasification Mission and NITI Aayog.  The broad terms of reference of the expert committee include identifying experts in India and co-opting as members, desk-based review of progress in hydrogen technology and also reviewing ongoing research projects in hydrogen technology.  It will also identify activities for implementation of coal-based hydrogen production and usage and assist the task force in implementation of the same.  The expert committee is expected to submit its report in three months.  In his Independence Day speech, the Prime Minister had announced a National Hydrogen Mission.  Coal is an important source of hydrogen making (brown hydrogen) apart from natural gas (grey hydrogen) and renewable energy (green hydrogen) through electrolysis.  In case of renewable energy (green hydrogen) surplus solar power is used to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen.  The global emphasis is on substituting liquid fuels with hydrogen (as fuel in vehicles), storage of surplus renewable power as hydrogen (as power cannot be stored at a cost effective price), and cutting down emission.  Coal has not been encouraged elsewhere because of the fear that while extracting hydrogen via coal (from the moisture embedded in coal) there may be carbon emission.  Almost 100 per cent of hydrogen produced in India is through natural gas.",

        "articleBody": "The proposed new coal-based power plants totalling 27 GW could  jeopardise  India's target of 450GW renewable energy by 2030, says a report by Ember and Climate Risk Horizons. As per the report, 27 GW of pre-permit and permitted new coal power plant proposals in India are now  superfluous to its electricity requirements .   These coal project proposals could jeopardise the achievement of India's widely-praised RE target of 450 GW by 2030,  it said. It said these surplus  zombie  plants - assets that would be neither dead nor alive - would require Rs 247,421 crore (USD 33 billion) of investment, and yet are projected to lie idle or operate at uneconomic capacity factors due to surplus generation capacity in the system.   As India recovers from the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, how the country uses scarce public resources will be absolutely crucial. By avoiding these unnecessary 'zombie' coal plants, India can not only save lakhs of crores of rupees, but also lower power costs and reiterate its commitment to the success of its clean energy transition goals,  Aditya Lolla, Ember's senior analyst, said.  The analysis by energy experts at Ember and Climate Risk Horizons demonstrates that India doesn't require new coal capacity beyond the 33 GW of new coal plants already being built, to meet demand growth by FY2030.  Even with aggressive projections of 5 per cent annual growth in power demand, the analysis shows that coal-fired generation in FY 2030 will be lower than in FY2020, as long as India achieves its 450 GW RE and other non-coal targets, it stated.  The report finds that over 300 GW of renewable energy (RE) commitments have already been made by India's public and private power generators.  Furthermore, it stated that India can meet peak demand in FY2030 even if it retires its old coal plants and stops building new coal beyond those under construction.  By FY2030, India will have a total firm capacity of about 346 GW in addition to 420 GW of variable renewables capacity to meet an estimated peak demand of 301 GW.  Daytime peak demand would be easily met with India's huge planned solar capacity, while the report shows that evening peaks will be most effectively met by additional battery storage, at a lower cost than building new coal.  The analysis reveals that switching investment from coal projects to renewables and battery storage would save the Indian power system an additional Rs 43,219 crore (USD 4 billion) a year from 2027 onwards in terms of reduced power purchase cost - in addition to capex savings - without sacrificing the power system's ability to meet future demand.  Abhishek Raj of Climate Risk Horizons, said, Once incurred, these wasted investments will lock DISCOMs and consumers into expensive contracts and jeopardise India's RE goals by adding to the system's overcapacity. The smart option is to divert these resources to renewables and storage to build a cheaper, more resilient grid for the future.   According to the analysis, the private sector investment on the proposed new coal-based plants will be Rs 62,912 crore. Of this, JSW Energy, which publicly stated it will not build any new coal plants, is proposing a Rs 10,130 crore Barmer coal expansion project, it stated.  Meanwhile, Adani Group and Bajaj Group are proposing Rs 26,286 crore and Rs 17,998 crore, respectively on new coal plants, it stated.",

        "articleBody": "Geoffrey M. Heal teaches at Columbia Business School. Speaking to Srijana Mitra Das, he discusses the clean energy transition, why environmental credits work \u2014 and sustainable businesses succeeding nancially:Q. Which industries will climate change most powerfully impact? A. It will impact the utility industry. The generation of electricity, one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases, will have to move from coal and gas to wind, solar and hydro. It will also affect the transportation business \u2014 most transport is based on jet fuel, gasoline, etc. This will have to be fuelled by nonpolluting sources, so there\u2019s a big transition there. Buildings will have to be retrofitted with new technologies for heating and cooling. Construction will also be i m p a c t e d \u2014 making concrete is a lead ing source of CO2 emi s sions . Several companies are now working on green concrete, made by technologies which don\u2019t add CO2 to the atmosphere. Q. Will climate change impact industry supply chains? A. We are already seeing this. Some years ago, floods in Thailand disrupted supply chains for several electronics industries. Bangladesh and Vietnam, which cater to the global clothing and electronics industries, are both vulnerable to climate change. A business with a global supply chain must diversify much more across locations now. Q. Which businesses are noticeably transitioning already? A. Quite a few utilities are investing heavily in renewable energy which is cheaper now than coal or gas. The automobile industry is transitioning \u2014 most of the big automakers worldwide are beginning to produce cars fuelled by non-polluting batteries or hydrogen. Tesla was the first but General Motors, Ford, Nissan and others are doing so too. Q. What are the key economic aspects of this energy transition? A. It will require a lot of capital. While renewable energy is less expensive than fossil fuel energy, it is more capitalintensive. When you build a wind turbine or a solar power station, all the costs are upfront. You have the capital costs of building this but no operating costs due to no fuel and little labour. You pay all the costs for the plant\u2019s lifetime upfront \u2014 this means more capital which capital markets should raise and move about. 85907944Q. Decarbonisation means more electrification \u2014 how does that impact electricity pricing? A. This is a very important issue. We need to price electricity at close to cost \u2014 the marginal cost of electricity from renewable energy is very low. We should price electricity at that level. Currently, what I pay for electricity includes its actual generation, the cost of the grid and the cost of transporting power \u2014 I pay 20 cents per kWh while the actual cost is five cents. We need to separate the price of electricity from these other factors which could be charged through taxation. People should pay closer to the marginal cost. That\u2019ll make it more attractive to electrify multiple systems. We must rethink how power is priced. Q. Are sustainable companies also doing well financially? A. Tesla is a good example \u2014 it produces clean cars and is among the most valuable automobile companies in the world now. Its stock market valuation is quite extraordinary. Some companies producing wind turbines, solar panels and clean energy batteries have also done extremely well over the last decade. Q. How do you define what you call \u2018weak and strong sustainability\u2019? A. All our prosperity comes from capital like physical, intellectual and natural capital. Sustainability means managing your capital in a way that you don\u2019t deplete your assets excessively. Weak sustainability means we\u2019re preserving enough of our total assets, so that our living standards won\u2019t fall. We might be depleting natural capital but accumulating intellectual capital faster to compensate in terms of income generated. Strong sustainability means we\u2019re keeping natural capital intact. However, we\u2019re actually depleting natural capital excessively now. Climate change ref lects this as the climate system is part of our natural capital. Q. Do we need to think beyond GDP for encouraging sustainability? A. GDP is a flow. We need to also think about stocks. To understand a company\u2019s financial situation, we examine its income statement or the flow of monies. But we also look at its balance sheet or the stock of its assets. GDP is a flow but there\u2019s nothing equivalent to a balance sheet when we look at national accounts. We need national balance sheets to measure our capital stocks. Doing so will help us understand the state of natural capital and drive measures for sustainability. The OECD has recommended this.Q. You helped develop the pathbreaking REDD project offering carbon credits for maintaining forests \u2014 what were your key insights? A. Forest conservation is essential to balance the climate system. It is also relatively cheap because the economic uses of tropical forests are limited. You can\u2019t really convert these to good agricultural land, so the opportunity cost of maintaining them is quite low. We offered credits over measures like taxation because that\u2019s the only thing that will work. There are huge tropical forests in countries like Indonesia. You can\u2019t punish these nations for deforestation. It\u2019s far more effective to use positive incentives with the international community helping them maintain forests which maintain climate stability. (Views expressed are personal)",

        "articleBody": "India has the potential to meet not just the country's, but also the global demand for green hydrogen, Union Minister of State for Earth Sciences and Science and Technology, Jitendra Singh, said on Friday.He was speaking at the inaugural event of 'International Climate Summit 2021', an initiative by the Environment Committee, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The summit's theme was 'Powering India's Hydrogen Ecosystem'.Explaining India's 'aspirational' goal of 'Hydrogen 2-1-2', the minister said,  2 means green hydrogen that nation costs for less than $2 per kg; 1 means hydrogen storage plus distribution plus refuelling that cost less than $1 per kg and the last 2 is for replacement of incubement end-use technology with green hydrogen technology of less than 2 millions.  More than 90 per cent of our energy is met by imported fossil fuels. Given our population size, the problem of climate change in the world cannot be resolved unless India reduces its emission. That is both a responsibility as well as obligation,  the minister said.He recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the launch of the National Hydrogen Energy Mission during his 75th Independence Day and spoken about transforming India into a global Green Hydrogen hub for production and exports.Meanwhile, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, said,  We intend to achieve 40 per cent of non-fossil usage by 2030, making a significant stride towards improving the current state of the country and establishing a green hydrogen ecosystem to smoothen the path to a responsible living. Addressing the conference virtually, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited, Mukesh Ambani, said,  India is determined to achieve 'Azaadi' from dependence on fossil energy and become 'AatmaNirbhar' in new and renewable energy. Since climate change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today, we should rapidly transition to a new era of clean, green and renewable energy. Green hydrogen, a zero-carbon energy will play a fundamental role in the world's decarbonization plans. Stating that every challenge in the human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress; climate change is an opportunity for human to renew themselves, Ambani shared a target of green hydrogen of 1-1-1.  $1 per kg of hydrogen in one decade can be achieved,  he said.Co-organised by Invest India in partnership with NITI Aayog, MoEF&CC, Department of Scientific & Industrial Research, CSIR, and the Department of Science & Technology, Government of India, the summit was attended by experts, nobel laureates, policy makers, industry leaders, and scientists from across the globe.",

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Wednesday said a policy will be framed on producing ethanol using broken rice.  Today the Cabinet approved proposals to frame policies on ethanol production and data processing. Extensive guidelines will be prepared in the coming days. The ethanol policy will help farmers in their economy and it will attract more investments in the state,  Chatterjee told reporters. After the Cabinet meeting chaired by the chief minister, Chatterjee said several organisations have requested the state to come out with a policy regarding data processing and hence the decision to frame one was made. The Cabinet also decided to take steps to encourage engineering and foundry industry in the state, he said. Ethanol will be used as bio-fuel and many investors will come for this. It has the potential to provide 48,000 jobs involving an investment of Rs 15,000 crore, Banerjee had said on Wednesday at Panagarh while laying the foundation stone of a poly film factory there. Chatterjee said the newly formed West Bengal Industrial Promotion Board, headed by the chief minister, will be meeting for the first time on September 15. The Board was set up aiming at facilitating investments in the state, he added.",

        "articleBody": "The Draft Electricity (promoting renewable energy through Green Energy Open Access) Rules, 2021, announced by the Ministry of Power, if implemented, could improve the certainty of cash flows for new renewable energy projects coming up through this route, Crisil Ratings said.In India, power distribution happens through three modes \u2013 state distribution companies, captive sources and open access. Under the open access route, which had a total installed capacity of 11 GW as on March 31, 2021, renewable power producers sell electricity directly to commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers.These consumers pay open access charges to state distribution companies (discoms). Such open access projects are hobbled by state- level policy changes that make returns uncertain.The draft rules aim to provide clarity on such open access charges \u2013 including, inter alia, cross-subsidy surcharge (to compensate discoms for loss of high paying C&I consumers), additional surcharge (to recover the fixed power purchase cost for stranded assets), and banking charges (for consuming energy on a later date) \u2013 and will help streamline the overall approval process to improve predictability of cash flows for renewable power producers, it said in a statement.The ministry has sought feedback on the rules from stakeholders, including state regulatory bodies and discoms.State regulators haven\u2019t been fully backing open access projects fearing their discoms would lose high-tariff paying C&I customers. Consequently, they raise levy of cross-subsidy and additional surcharges, or change banking provisions by removing/lowering the banking period. Since renewable projects have a lifespan of 25 years, uncertainty around open access charges and tightened banking norms make project returns more vulnerable, thereby influencing the viability of these projects.For instance, some of the key states having a majority share of open access capacities have levied cross-subsidy and additional surcharges of Rs 1.5 - 2 per unit \u2013 on average \u2013 in the past three fiscals. On the other hand, some states have either removed or lowered the banking period, which affords flexibility to developers (to bank their unsold power with discoms if the offtake of a C&I consumer is affected for a few days).Ankit Hakhu, Director, CRISIL Ratings, said \u201cEvery 10 paise increase in cross-subsidy and additional surcharges results in a 150 basis points (bps) reduction in returns for open access project developers. Reducing the banking period with state discoms increases the risk to the revenue of developers if the offtake by C&I consumers is affected for a few days.\u201dOpen access projects also face hurdles related to timely approvals and states reneging on policy support. For instance, developers faced approval delays in Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, while Karnataka, Haryana and Maharashtra have tried to change their policy support features.The draft rules propose to address these issues. The document states that cross-subsidy surcharge should not be increased by more than 50% for a 12-year period from the date of project commissioning. Also, any additional surcharge cannot be levied on these projects. This is to ensure predictability on open access charges and thus the cash flows of developers.The draft rules also propose to limit how much power can be banked with state discoms \u2013 up to 10% of the annual consumption of the consumer. This will allow the C&I consumer to draw banked power from discoms later, thereby providing some stability to the cash flows of developers.Further, a central nodal agency is to be set up to streamline the approval process. All open access applications have to be submitted on the agency\u2019s portal and subsequently routed to the state nodal agency for approval. If approval is not granted within 15 days, the application will be deemed approved subject to the fulfilment of the technical requirement to ensure timely execution of these projects and minimise any risk of cost escalations.On an average, cross-subsidy and additional surcharges form 65-70% of total open access charges.Aditya Jhaver, Director, Crisil Ratings, said, \u201cGiven the government\u2019s target of installing 450 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, the draft rules, if finalised as is, would be a timely measure as these can provide a fillip to open access renewable energy capacity addition. Considering C&I consumers account for almost 50% of all power consumption in India, and have their own go-green initiatives, the open access route can support likely strong demand pull from these consumers.\u201dThe final shape of the rules and their implementation will be the key monitorables.",

        "articleBody": "The Maharashtra government could be on its way to shifting from thermal power to wind, solar or other environment-friendly sources of energy as the state begins efforts to implement climate mitigation measures. The state government on Wednesday decided to form a state council for climate change to oversee the state\u2019s efforts. It will be working with different departments in a coordinated manner to implement those steps.The council would be headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and minister Ajit Pawar would be the deputy chair. The council would coordinate with different state departments on corrective steps and present a monthly report to the cabinet.The climate mitigation and adaption goals are not just on paper. ET spoke to Maharashtra\u2019s environment secretary Manisha Mhaiskar, who said, \u201cWe would be working with five departments \u2014 energy, transport, industry, agriculture and urban development \u2014 on climate mitigation and adaptation measures. These are the core sectors to work towards a carbon- neutral pathway.\u201dGiving an example of how these departments could help, she said, \u201cThe energy department could have a time bound plan to shift from thermal power stations and rely more on wind or solar energy.\u201dAddressing a press conference earlier in the day, environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that mentioned the adverse effects witnessed by the state was the immediate trigger for the formation of the council.Aaditya said that henceforth each cabinet note from different departments would carry a point on how the proposal would work towards the goal of sustainability. Describing the urgent need for taking corrective measures, he said that the current change in climate and extreme weather events have showed that \u201cwe are in a climate emergency and we don\u2019t have the luxury to wait any longer\u201d.The minister later tweeted that an action plan would involve departments like energy, transportation, industry, agriculture and urban development for adopting environment-friendly programmes.",

Are we surprised? Science predicts for us and ALL measures are flashing red! While we are still figuring out why the cicadas emerged earlier than their 17-year life span and what we did is causing frequent and devastating locust swarms, we are marching closer to the yet-to-occur climate change predictions:- Half of all plant and animal species to face local extinction.- Severe food insecurity.- Marine ecosystems to collapse and fish species to go extinct.- Economic damage to lead to average incomes cut by 23%- Three-quarters of the world\u2019s population to experience potentially deadly temperature extremes and significantly frequent extreme droughts.All the top 5 risks by likelihood are converging, making \u201cEnvironmental Stewardship\u201d pivotal to planet sustainability. Global ESG action will be the bulwark against massive direct impact on global social and economic dimensions.As the UN chief reminds us , \u201cwe are way off track\u201d from the \u201cambitious, yet achievable\u201d goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, we continue to witness the stark differences at G20 nation meets. Contributing to 85% of the global greenhouse gas emissions and staying at top on per capita emissions, the G20 discussions on climate change often create a cacophony that misses the real point: we are in danger as a species! Focus has to dramatically shift to absolute reductions in quick time. The entire planet must converge on this thinking.The latest European green deal \u201cFit for 55\u201d is set to influence a wide range of policies aligning them to cut EU\u2019s emissions by 55% by 2030. While we dissect and weigh the effectiveness and fairness across multiple dimensions, let\u2019s salute the EU for its focus, action and commitments: be it legally binding policies; be it EU taxonomy, the first-ever of its kind; or the extension of Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to 50,000 companies.The US federal administration qualifies its announcement to cut 50 \u2013 52% of carbon emission by 2030, as pushing progress, creating jobs and achieving justice. The world, particularly the next generation of global citizens are watching as the US, a historical polluter that stands second in total and per capita emissions, fulfils its moral responsibility to reduce the emission disparity that it heavily contributed to.While India has not yet declared a net-zero commitment date, its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is already aligned to the 2 degrees target of the Paris Agreement and is set to exceed the agreement with commitments such as 450 GW of green energy by 2030. Top priority for developing countries, and particularly for India, is to prepare for the devastating consequences. They have to be self-sufficient in terms of policies, solutions, technology, actions and behavioural changes, as they have more to correct with less. Posting the lowest per capita emission among G20 countries, India has rightfully urged others to reduce.Urgently scientists need to project scenarios based on ESG policies of China, Russia, Brazil and Australia. G20 as a pack have the out-and-out power to save or fail the planet. That makes COP 26 the most significant global event which must unfalteringly initiate the journey of action led by collaboration, accountability, attitude and urgency.Let us zoom a level down to markets and businesses and see how ESG is influencing corporate and ecosystem practices.Sustainable Investments: As per the latest report from Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, the global sustainable investment reached USD 35 trillion, a 15% increase in the past two years (2018- 2020). The most common sustainable investment strategy is found to be ESG integration, followed by negative screening and corporate engagement & shareholder action. The fact that the investments under \u201cImpact Investing\u201d was low in the ranking indicates the need for more outcome-based commitments.Indian Sustainable funds inflow has already risen by more than 75% so far this year according to the data released by Morningstar. India\u2019s sustainable bond issues have made up over 60% of total external commercial borrowings so far this year, according to a recent report by Bloomberg.Regulators and Reporting: A vast majority of the leading market and financial regulators across the globe have kept stakeholders on their toes through actions such as the establishment of the Sustainability Standards Board, uniform reporting policies and expansion of mandatory disclosures. Global Standard Setters are exploring synergised actions such as establishment of Value Reporting Foundation and common reporting frameworks. Planet earth needs trustworthy disclosures and binding commitments urgently.India becomes one of the first few countries to mandate sustainability reporting through the establishment of BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting) this year. BRSR is significantly more quantified, qualified, comprehensive and well-aligned to global standards and frameworks when compared to BRR (Business Responsibility Reporting), its predecessor. BRSR, a set of prescriptive disclosures complements Integrated Report which is principle-based. BRSR is expected to transform India\u2019s corporate annual reporting across three dimensions:- Enable the narration of a truly integrated storyline through financial and non-financial dimensions.- Significantly increase the relevance and relativity of information that is presented.- Curb greenwashing by ensuring consistency of messaging and claims through data supported validations.Assurance: Reporting has established a reasonable amount of clarity and direction. Assurance , rating and ranking of ESG disclosures and performance need standardisation and regulation. The demand for ESG data and rating has grown epidemically. We now need transparent rating methodology, relevant assurance parameters and harmonisation across different providers. International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has just taken steps towards regularization by way of a consultation paper. An ESG assurer will need to certify an organization\u2019s stakeholder engagement; materiality; reporting frameworks; globally acceptable measures and their relevance; impact and claims of outcomes across financial and non-financial parameters.When it comes to emissions, disclosure through CDP (formerly known as Carbon Disclosure Project) is increasingly considered a standard business practice as over 10,000 companies across the globe adopt CDP standards. 67 of India\u2019s top 200 companies have disclosed their emissions through CDP in 2020. The Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) enables businesses to set emission targets in line with the latest climate science (and thereby the most assured method available). SBTi has just announced its strategy to reset corporate targets to '1.5\u00b0C\u2019 instead of \u2018well below 2\u00b0C\u2019. All companies and financial institutions that submit targets from 15 July 2022 will need to align to the new criteria.Business Integration and linked outcomes: ESG has eventually made its point beyond disclosures and reporting for a vast majority of entities in the last couple of years. Businesses globally are recognizing the need and advantages of integrating sustainability into their strategy, model, products, services, supply-chain and risk.Reimagining the business through the lens of sustainability is leading to sustainability strategies that have potential to be a competitive advantage. Leaders and early starters such as Hindustan Unilever and Hindustan Zinc are conveying that sustainability is an obligation only until the right solutions are figured out. They are demonstrating that sustainable solutions can deliver long term value, stakeholder intimacy, increased financial performance and brand image.Focus by Board of Directors: Right now boards who have not so far responded to ESG, must commence actions to reap the lead-time advantage. Several Indian boards such as Infosys, L&T Financial Holdings and Welspun India have established ESG committees with a focussed charter.Leaders are setting the tone at the top; ensuring ESG integration with core business; and overseeing strategy linkage to outcomes and communication. These aspects are typically found to be included in the charter of ESG Committees. Upskilling of the board and enriching board composition with ESG expertise are getting traction and are positively expected to deliver outcomes in the medium to long term.Digital Technology: Sustainability Transformation has kicked off the exhilarating journey of digital transformation. On one end is the European Space Agency\u2019s massive \u201cDigital Twin of Earth\u201d, which is expected to monitor the health of the planet and forecast extreme climate change through simulation of effects of human behaviour. On the operational side, the gap is narrowing between ERP and ESG when it comes to an entity\u2019s resource planning. We need an insightful supply of digital capabilities that would enable end to end Sustainability Transformation such as:- ESG integration into business and supply chain- Manage and monitor implementation of ESG charter across the value-chain- Enable Net Zero journey- Assess, measure, manage and report materiality- Identify and manage risks and opportunities- Analyse impacts and course-correct- Understand and adopt best practices from ecosystems- Correlate to measured outcomes- Trustworthy data and data analytics- White box rating and ranking- Democratisation of sustainabilityWe postulate that most digital technologies such as Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) will find their use cases deployed in sustainability sooner than later.Net Zero Commitments: While just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of total global GHG, having a net-zero commitment from over 1500 companies may look a lot for the cause. However, the devil is in the details! The commitments are made by the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel polluters, big techs, wealthiest financiers, and retailer giants. Around 60 of India\u2019s largest firms such as Tata, Reliance, Adani, Infosys, Wipro, Mahindra, ITC, ACC, JSW Energy, HCL and HDFC Bank have made their carbon neutrality commitments.All net-zero promises are to be read along with:- The efficacy and reliability of the solutions that are mapped out.- The vicinity of timelines.- Clarity and reliability of underlying plans.- The overall intent and action the organizations demonstrate consistently across all of its currenttouchpoints. Dangerous Distractions: Several fundamental misconnections and questions regarding Net Zero concept design and implementation have led to research and discussions of \u201cDangerous Distractions\u201d. To list a few:- The convenient and irresponsible focus on \u201cremoval\u201d than \u201creduction\u201d.- The over-reliance on non-existent, expensive, energy-intensive and unproven-to-be-deployed-at-scale removal technologies.- The unestablished business case of offsets being able to deliver same impacts in same timescaleas emissions draw down.- The ability of policies and commitments to address the disparity of emissions.- Impact and action between the richer northern and exploited southern hemisphere.CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage), CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage), non-linear afforestation, Direct Air Capture (DAC), Solar Geoengineering, Carbon trading and offsets; have all come under the scrutiny of \u201cDangerous Distractions\u201d .Focus on aggressive reductions and proven solutions are priority! Climate Solutions 101 presented by Project Drawdown, drawing on humanity\u2019s collective wisdom about the practices and technologies that can begin to reverse the curve by mid-century, could be a great start to understanding solutions and making them happen while we still work on the latest technologies to figure out faster and cheaper solutions.The time to act is NOW. Be aggressive, be persuasive, be collaborative, be anxious for outcomes to deliver reductions, be faithful to commitments and above all LOVE YOUR PLANET. Communities, Governments, Regulators and individuals will all have to come together to save our only home: Planet Earth. There is no Plan B!Shailesh Haribhakti is a Chartered Accountant",

        "articleBody": "Rating agency ICRA has said its outlook for renewable energy (RE) sector is stable supported by continued policy support from the government, strong project pipeline and superior tariff competitiveness offered by wind and solar power projects -- both in the utility and the open-access segments. Further, tariff competitiveness offered by the solar and wind power projects in utility auction route continued to remain superior with tariffs remaining below Rs 3 per unit despite the upward pressure arising from the imposition of customs duty on imported cells and modules from April 2022. Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President and Co-Group Head of ICRA ratings, said the investment prospects in RE sector are expected to remain strong, given the policy impetus with a target to reach 450 GW by FY2030 and competitive tariffs.  The capacity addition over medium term will be driven by RE segment, led by a strong project pipeline of close to 40 GW,  he said. The key challenges constraining growth remain on the execution front, mainly associated with land and transmission infrastructure as well as the slow but improving progress in signing of power purchase agreements and power sale agreements by intermediate procurers with state distribution utilities (discoms). An improving financing environment along with softening in interest rate for the RE projects over the last 12 to 18 months period has been a positive for the sector, said ICRA. ",

        "articleBody": "Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said India will make it mandatory for auto manufacturers to offer vehicles running 100 per cent on bio-fuels in the next six months. Such a move will be cost-effective for consumers, who are hassled by the high petrol prices, the minister said, pointing out that a litre of bioethanol costs Rs 65 as against Rs 110 paid for petrol. The alternative fuel is also less polluting and saves forex.  We are committed to delivering vehicles with flex engine norms. We have taken a decision, we will make it mandatory by which there will be a flex-engine,  Gadkari said at an event hosted by domestic brokerage Elara Capital.  Within six months, we will give orders for making flex engines (mandatory),  he said, adding that state-run oil marketing companies have already been ordered to offer bio-fuels at the same facilities as the one selling petrol and diesel. The minister said consumers will have a choice between petrol and bioethanol and a switch to the alternative is also essential for the country because of the surplus production of crops like rice, maize, corn and sugar, from which bioethanol is made. He added that in many of the crops, the minimum support price offered to the farmers is higher than the commercial price or the one in international prices, making it essential for diverting the harvest for the overall betterment of the country. Gadkari said manufacturing of electronic vehicles is also on at a fast pace across categories and estimated that there will be a flood of such automobiles on the roads in a year. He also said that in the next five years, he wants India to be the leading auto manufacturing hub in the world offering vehicles with all the fuels for the world. The recently launched vehicle scrappage policy will help in sourcing of raw materials, he said. Efforts are also underway on using hydrogen as a fuel, and to tap the gas from sea water and sewage water, Gadkari said, without sharing specifics. Meanwhile, Gadkari said the National Highways Authority of India has already been undertaking monetisation efforts through which it has raised over Rs 40,000 crore, and sounded confident about achieving the incremental target of raising Rs 1.60 lakh crore from the roads sector included in the national monetization plan announced earlier this month. He said NHAI will raise the money either through the 'toll-operate-transfer' model that has been used previously or also through the infrastructure investment trust (InvITs) which is to be floated soon by the NHAI. The minister asked long-term money managers like pension and insurance funds to come forward and invest in the issues floated by NHAI for better returns, pointing out that the overall toll collections are likely to shoot up to Rs 1.40 lakh crore per year in five years from the present Rs 40,000 crore per year. NHAI is giving smaller bundles for monetization, which will entail commitments of around Rs 500 crore as against Rs 5,000 crore earlier, Gadkari said, reasoning that such smaller bundles attract smaller investors and also increase the returns for the authority. He said regular monetization efforts through diverse instruments will also help the NHAI continue with its ambitious plans on road building, which includes constructing 26 express highways across the country. Gadkari assured that in the next three years, Indian roads will be at par with the ones seen in the US or Europe from a quality perspective. The government is also targeting to lower fatalities through a variety of interventions over time and take the number to zero deaths on highways by 2030, Gadkari said, adding that engineering, enforcement, education and emergency care services can be of help.",

        "articleBody": "Delhi will start implementing a new 10-year action plan by this year end to combat climate change, according to officials. The Centre had prepared the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2009 and asked the states to prepare their own specific plans.  However, Delhi submitted its plan to combat climate change in 2019, becoming the last state to do so.   The plan remained mostly on paper and could not be implemented properly. It expired in 2020. Now, we are due for a new plan,  a senior official of the environment department said.  The previous plan focused on six areas, including energy, transport, green cover and urban development, and projected a significant decrease in cold days and nights and increase in heavy rainfall events in Delhi.  For the new plan, a German agency is likely to be engaged as a knowledge partner. The environment department has requested the Union Environment Ministry to release Rs 20 lakh for the preparation of the plan.  All extreme weather events of the last 10 years are being analysed to prepare a comprehensive plan which will focus on air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, transport issues, air conditioning, heat islands, agriculture patterns, etc., the official said.  The action plan will identify activities causing increase in greenhouse gas emissions and fix responsibilities of the departments concerned. It will set targets to be achieved in phases over the next 10 years.   All consultations with stakeholders will be completed within two months and the plan will be implemented by this year end,  the official said.  The environment department had taken eight years to complete consultations with stakeholders concerned while preparing the previous plan.  Delhi had recorded its coldest-ever day since 1901 on December 30, 2019. Since August last year, the city has been breaking weather records every month.",

        "articleBody": "Mumbai municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has made a sinister prediction for the city, saying that by 2050, a major portion of south Mumbai, including the business district of Nariman Point and state secretariat Mantralaya, will go under water due to the rising sea level. Speaking at the launch of Mumbai Climate Action Plan and its website at the hands of Maharashtra Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Friday, Chahal said about 70 per cent of the city's A, B, C and D wards in south Mumbai will be under water due to climate change. He said that nature has been giving warnings, but if people do not  wake up  then the situation would turn  dangerous .  Eighty per cent of the areas like Cuffe Parade, Nariman Point and Mantralaya will be under water...Means going to disappear,  he said. The civic chief also said that it is a matter of just 25-30 years as 2050 is not too far.  We are getting warnings from nature and if we do not wake up, it will be a dangerous situation for the next 25 years. And it will not only be the next generation but the current generation will also suffer,  Chahal warned. He said that Mumbai is the first city in South Asia that is preparing its climate action plan and acting on it.  Earlier, we used to hear about climate change events like melting glaciers, but not directly affecting us. But now it has come to our doorstep,  he added. Chahal said that last year for the first time in 129 years, a cyclone (Nisarga) hit Mumbai and thereafter in the last 15 months, there have been three cyclones. After that, on August 5, 2020, about 5 to 5.5 feet water was accumulated at Nariman point.  There was no cyclone warning that day, but considering the parameters, it was a cyclone,  Chahal said. Highlighting that the city has witnessed some extreme weather condictions recently, he said that the city faced Tauktae cyclone in Mumbai and witnessed 214 mm rain on May 17, though monsoon arrives here on June 6 or 7. Before June 9, Mumbai recorded 84 per cent of the June rainfall and in July, 70 per cent of month's average rainfall was received in just four days - from July 17 to 20, he said. Under the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP), the data assessment has identified areas and communities most vulnerable given increasing climate uncertainty, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a release. Data from across BMC's 37 automatic weather stations (AWS) over the past 10 years suggests that on an average, Mumbai has seen six heavy, five very heavy, and four extremely heavy rainfall days per year. And for all the rainfall that occurs during the monsoon season in Mumbai, each year, approximately 10 per cent falls under the heavy category, nine per cent very heavy, and six per cent extremely heavy. According to the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) classification, daily rainfall from 64.5 mm to 115.5 mm is considered 'heavy', 115.6 mm to 204.4mm 'very heavy' and more than 204.5mm is 'extreme'.  The four-year period between 2017 and 2020 has seen a steady increase in the extremely heavy rainfall events. This indicates that the frequency of such extreme weather events is increasing for the city of Mumbai especially over the past four years,  said Lubaina Rangwala, Associate Director, WRI India Ross Center for Sustainable Cities.",

The Jharkhand government aims to facilitate investment to the tune of Rs 1 lakh crore in the state and generate 5 lakh jobs through two days investors meeting beginning Friday here during which Soren launched the state's Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (JIIPP).   During one on on meeting with Tata Group officials, the Chief Minister asked them why can't they open an electric vehicles manufacturing plant in the state,  an official privy to the meeting told PTI.  Tata Motors, one of the leading automobile manufacturers, has one of its manufacturing plants already located in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand.  A Tata Group senior official told PTI that the discussions centred around the proposed EV policy of the state and expansion of group activities in the state and the group would soon come out with suggestions in this regard.  Tata Motors Global Head, Corporate Affairs, Sushant Naik, along with other senior officials from the Tata Group are said to be attending the meeting with Soren and other senior officials from the state including the Chief Secretary, Sukhdev Singh.  Welcoming the players, Soren said:  We have a big workforce waiting for the opportunity. We have abundant amenities in our state. In Jharkhand, a substantial part of the population is from SC/ST communities. If SC/ST people are employed, we will add more incentives to the policy. ...with your support, our state can touch heights. The proposed electric vehicle policy has been presented in front of you. If we look towards the future then I believe electric vehicles are the future vehicles where we can do as much as we want.   The Jharkhand delegation, headed by the Chief Minister, also held talks with major players like Honda Cars, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motors besides tops executives of Dalmia Bharat Cement Ltd, NTPC, SAIL, GAIL, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Tata Power and Tata Sons, among others.  Separate meetings are scheduled with a large number of investors including top executives of Adani Power and Toyota etc.  They were briefed about the key features of Electronics Manufacturing Cluster (Adityapur), Jharkhand Electric Vehicle Policy 2021 and Jharkhand Ethanol Policy 2021.  Secretary Industries, Jharkhand, Puja Singhal, said:  We are going to provide 100 per cent exemption in stamp duty and registration fee to the companies. Also, companies that promise to invest in the electric vehicle sector within the first 2 years since the launch of EV policy will be provided land at a 50 per cent subsidy by harkhand Industrial Area Development Authority, JIADA. 100 per cent incentive for MSMEs on GST for 7 Years, whereas 9 and 13 Years for large and mega-scale industries. Additionally, we are proposing 100 per cent exemption from vehicle registration fees and 100 per cent exemption from road tax.   The Dalmia Cement group committed to investing Rs 500 crore in the state along with others in multiple sectors such as automobiles.  With the launch of JIIPP 2021, the state government will promote business opportunities in the fields of textile and apparel, automobile, electric vehicles, food processing, pharma, electronic system design and manufacturing, tourism, health, IT & ITeS, renewable energy, breweries and distilleries, startup and incubation centres, education and MSME sectors, he said.  The state government aims at promoting Jharkhand as an industrial hub for electric vehicles, electronic manufacturing, ethanol and other high priority sectors.  To establish the state as a hub of electronics system design and manufacturing, a cluster has been set up near Jamshedpur.  Adityapur Electronic Manufacturing Cluster Ltd, a special purpose company, was established for its smooth functioning.  It is a greenfield project spread across 82 acre of land, he said, adding that the campus has 92 units with plug & play facilities.  An area of 49 acre has been booked for open infrastructure, which is ready to be allocated for 51 electronic manufacturing units.  The JIIPP promises investors up to 100 per cent relief from SGST for nine years and 75 per cent for large scale industries for 12 years.  The policy offers an incentive up to Rs 25 crore as a comprehensive investment project subsidy with an additional 5 per cent provision for women and specially abled investors and entrepreneurs belonging to SC and ST communities.  Apart from these, the policy has proposed interest and power subsidy benefits.  The state Chief Secretary said the government will support investors and stand by them to actualise their investments into returns and growth.  During the launch of the policy here, the chief minister will hold one-on-one meetings with all stakeholders and representatives from different business houses from across the country, where he will listen to the proposals of investors.  Jharkhand is the largest producer of Tasar silk in India and the second-largest manufacturer of horticulture crops.  Apart from road, rail and air connectivity, India's second multi-modal port has been developed on the river Ganges, which provides opportunities to industries established in Jharkhand to the global market.  The government is planning to revive sick industrial units and the state administration has identified several such facilities which can be revived, as per the state government.  These factories can resume operations under the beneficial provisions of the JIIPP 2021.",

        "articleBody": "India and Australia are investing heavily to achieve energy targets, Consul General of Australia Rowan Ainsworth said at an energy conclave. Australia and India have similar goals in reducing emissions with wide adoption of technologies, she said during the virtual conclave organised by Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Thursday. The diplomat said that the government of Australia is committed to technology driven energy transition just like India and regular dialogues are held between the two countries for energy storage systems, energy efficiencies and renewable energy.  Australia's focus is on partnering with other countries to de-carbonize and ensure our economies can work. Few key strengths of Australia's approach are discussed like reducing emissions, using renewable, and finally cooperating with India,  she said.. Australia is proud to be a founding member of International Solar Alliance. India's leadership in this important issue is appreciated for sustainable development and energy security, she said adding India and Australia have also collaborated on global minerals. Turning to water security, she said it has become important due to the rising population.  Australia and India will also launch the Australia and India water dialogue and bring water experts to the table,  she added. Suresh Kumar, the additional chief secretary to the department of power, West Bengal, said the issue is decarbonization which is a global issue.  Energy transition which was previously based on fossil fuels is going through a change and now we're getting into more and more renewables all over the world. West Bengal fortunately has always been very beneficial in terms of number of coal mines. We also had a number of power stations and we did not have to transport coal for more than 20 to 30 km,  he added. \u00b7The state had the advantage of having the best natural resources close to the power station. Even it is going through a transition now.  We understand that it's not feasible to run more and more thermal power stations. The gestation time of a thermal power station is around three to five years, he added. Acting British Deputy High Commissioner, Kolkata, Sophie Ross, US Consul General Melinda Pavek were among those who attended the first session.",

        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Ba3 rating to Adani Green Energy's proposed USD senior secured notes.According to Moody's scale of ratings, obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and subject to substantial credit risk.It has assigned a Ba3 rating to the proposed USD senior secured notes to be issued by Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), a statement by Moody's said adding that the outlook is stable.AGEL will primarily use the proceeds from the USD notes to on-lend to its direct and indirect subsidiaries for them to fund the development of utility-scale renewable power projects. The Ba3 rating assigned to AGEL's proposed notes reflects the company's predictable cash flow backed by long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) that are supported by its large and diversified portfolio of solar and wind generation projects, significant capital spending plans, demonstrated capacity to deliver on growth projects, backed by its experienced management team, and very high financial leverage,  says Abhishek Tyagi, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.AGEL's operating cash flows are stable, given the geographic diversification of its generation fleet reduces its exposure to potential fluctuations in the availability of solar and wind resources, it stated.Most of AGEL's projects have long-term PPAs with either central government-owned or state government-owned utilities, with predefined tariffs for the duration, of the contract. As of June 2021, AGEL's PPAs for operating projects had an average remaining life of around 20 years, which provides visibility over the company's long-term cash flow, it stated.AGEL has outlined a long-term target to grow its generation capacity to around 25 gigawatts (GW) by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.This is around 5x its current operational capacity, it stated. The Ba3 rating also considers AGEL's very high financial leverage, primarily driven by additional debt to fund its development commitment of around 20GW, it said.Over the next two to three years, AGEL's financial leverage \u2014 as measured by its consolidated cash flow from operations pre-working capital (CFO pre-WC)/debt \u2014 will be very high at about 2 per cent to 3 per cent, it stated.Moody's leverage metrics captures AGEL's consolidated debt balance, including the debt extended by Total Energies Group (Total, A1 stable) to Adani Green Energy Twenty Three Limited, a joint venture between Total and AGEL.Moody's expects AGEL's financial metrics to gradually improve over time, because its projects, once completed and operational, will start contributing to group earnings, it said.The extent and timing of such improvements will depend on AGEL's growth plans and the incremental debt that will be required for new development projects, it added.AGEL's credit profile is supported by its substantial shareholders -- Adani Group and Total Energies SE.Adani Group has a track record of supporting the group company's funding requirements through equity infusions or providing deeply subordinated loans. Such support provides AGEL flexibility in managing its capital or unforeseen external events, it stated.AGEL's credit profile factors in Moody's assumption that any funding shortfall for AGEL's capital spending plans that cannot be covered by more senior debt due to covenants, will be met by deeply subordinated shareholder loans or equity from sponsors.In terms of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, AGEL benefits from positive macroeconomic and sectoral trends in renewable energy and has low exposure to carbon transition risk, it said.AGEL's business is aligned with India's target to reduce its carbon footprint to meet nationally determined contributions.The Ba3 rating of the notes factors in moderate governance risk given the concentrated shareholding of AGEL, it stated.However, this risk is partially mitigated by the experienced management team, which has demonstrated its strong commitment and ability to manage solar projects, it explained.The stable rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation of AGEL's stable cash flows from long-term PPAs over the next few years and delivery of new projects.Upward rating momentum is unlikely over the next 12-18 months based on AGEL's business profile and financial strategy, it said.Nonetheless, Moody's could upgrade the rating over time if AGEL sustains a higher consolidated (CFO pre-WC)/debt of above 6 per cent, it stated.The rating could come under downward pressure if AGEL's credit profile deteriorates on a sustained basis, potentially because of weaker operational performance, a delay in the commissioning of new projects or aggressive acquisitions and capital spending beyond Moody's expectations.",

        "articleBody": "After making great strides in promoting renewable energy, India is once again being singled out as a global climate laggard. Its negotiators blocked agreement on tackling emissions at the G-20 meeting in Naples earlier this year, publishing an eye-catching dissent calling for the group to focus on bringing down high per-capita emissions in rich countries. India later skipped a ministerial meeting meant to prepare for the next global climate-change summit \u2014 the only one of 51 invitees to do so. Its leaders clearly resent pressure to set a date for reducing net carbon emissions to zero, as rival China has.The West\u2019s focus on India\u2019s lack of a net-zero target, however, may be misplaced. It risks missing a potentially major shift underway in the country.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always taken climate change seriously, he hasn\u2019t typically highlighted it as part of his domestic policy agenda. His recent Independence Day speech was different. Modi uses the speech, delivered from the ramparts of Delhi\u2019s Mughal-era Red Fort, to outline his government\u2019s major upcoming policy initiatives. Previous speeches launched his \u201cMake in India\u201d manufacturing push and his program to improve India\u2019s sanitation and hygiene.This year, Modi focused on climate change. He tailored the appeal to suit his hyper-nationalist image, pitching the energy transition as a matter of \u201cenvironmental security,\u201d as crucial as defending against the likes of China and Pakistan. He appealed for greater self-reliance, warning of India\u2019s dependence on petroleum imports. Modi talked about a new \u201cNational Hydrogen Mission\u201d to develop green hydrogen and fuel cells, and about the electrification of India\u2019s massive rail system. He could also have mentioned the government\u2019s new subsidy for electric vehicles, which might make electric two-wheelers, in particular, attractive to India\u2019s vast scooter- and motorcycle-riding population.I doubt India\u2019s government has shifted so strongly to greener rhetoric because of pressure from foreign diplomats and climate activists. It\u2019s more likely that Modi appreciates India\u2019s need for a compelling new growth narrative.India\u2019s growth engines had cooled even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Modi\u2019s big manufacturing push hadn\u2019t really paid off; private investment was at historic lows. Early-2000s confidence that India would be the next China, the new factory of the world, has crumbled over two decades of disappointment.In effect, there\u2019s no growth story left in India\u2019s economy that can enthuse both voters and investors. That\u2019s what Modi hopes to recover with his new narrative about green growth.Fortunately, a focus on greener growth might also work. In past decades, unsustainably low domestic prices for raw materials such as iron ore and coal helped drive high growth rates. That boom collapsed amid accusations of corruption and cronyism, as well as objections from many who lived in heavily polluted mining and industrial hotspots. Politically, Modi needs to find a less extractive growth model.Focusing on green opportunities also offers a possible solution to India\u2019s private investment problem. Nobody expects India\u2019s cash-strapped government to create new networks for urban mobility, new housing stock and energy-efficient factories on its own. It\u2019s going to need help from the private sector. If Modi\u2019s government can reduce investment risk in these greener sectors and activities, making them attractive investment propositions for global and domestic capital, it might well turn around its dismal economic record.The rest of the world should perhaps stop expecting India to fit within its own parameters of climate action and focus instead on whether it follows through on these new ambitions. While one should always take pledges about green new deals with considerable skepticism, on this occasion I\u2019m a little bit more optimistic. In other countries, \u201cgreen growth\u201d is usually an unwieldy attempt to reconcile the divergent priorities of jobs-first politicians and climate-first activists. In India, it is the only game left in town, because we may have lost in all the others.",

        "articleBody": "The ESG-focused fund-raising (green bonds) market, which has already scaled an all-time high so far this year, is set to cross the USD 10-billion-mark by December, according to Wall Street investment banking major JP Morgan, which has advised 12 of the 13 such bond issuances out of the country so far this year totalling USD 6.24 billion. According to the bank, the overall bond issuances from the country may touch USD 25 billion this year, having already raised USD 17.5 billion so far, of which ESG-compliant bonds constitute USD6.2 billion.  Globally, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) has become a key board-room topic since 2013-14 and soon investors have also been asking on the ESG principles of their investee companies.  The ESG idea has caught the attention of domestic corporates, investors and analysts as well and since 2015, 41 companies have raised over USD 17.2 billion in such funds of which USD 6.24 billion this year alone.  It can be recalled that in 2016, JP Morgan globally introduced a ban on financing of new coal mines and tighter restrictions on the financing of new coal-fired plants, which was expanded last year to include a full ban on providing lending, capital markets or advisory services to companies deriving the majority of their revenues from the extraction of coal, and by 2024, a phase out remaining credit exposure to such companies.  Earlier this year, it set a target to bring USD 2.5 trillion for solutions that support climate change and contribute to sustainable development over the next 10 years. This includes USD 1 trillion for green initiatives like renewable energy and clean technologies.   We've been part of all the 12 ESG/green bond sales this year so far, and we have a strong pipeline of ESG fund-raising for the rest of the year. So far domestic companies -- mostly renewable energy players and infrastructure companies-- have raised USD 6.24 billion and we see this scaling the USD 10-billion-mark this year,  Madhur Agarwal, managing director, debt capital markets, at JP Morgan India told PTI.  He also expects the overall forex debt raising to cross USD 25 billion this year, which will be the highest ever. Overseas bond issuances have already touched USD 17.5 billion compared to USD 13.3 billion for whole of 2020.   There is growing evidence that suggests that ESG factors, when integrated into investment analysis and portfolio construction, may offer investors potential long-term performance advantages. Accordingly, sustainable financing is also seeing strong momentum given ESG is a critical focus for institutional investors. Some large investors are also vocal about not investing in non-green sectors at all.  JP Morgan has led 12 out of 13 new ESG issuances worth USD6.24 billion so far this year and has been the only bank to lead both sustainability-linked (Ultratech Cement and Adani Electrical) deals and six debut issuances, he said.  Following are the ESG issuances this year: Ultratech Cement (USD 400 million) two Renew Power issuances (USD 460 million & USD 585 million), Greenko (USD 940 million), Hero Future (USD 363 million), Continuum Energy (USD 561 million), Delhi International Airport (USD 450 million), Shriram Transport (USD500 million), Novelis (500 million euros), Adani Electricity (USD 300 million), JSW Energy (USD 707 million), Acme Solar (USD 334 million) and Azure Power (USD 414 million).  Green bonds will continue to be led by renewable energy players, according to Agarwal, who sees green bond issuances gaining traction even outside the renewable energy space, such as the ones by Ultratech Cement and Delhi Airport. Also, more green debt will be raised to cut carbon emissions by sectors like steel and cement.  According to Deal Logic, 2015 saw just two issuers tapping the ESG market raising USD 850 million, the next year had three issues worth USD 1.3 billion, which trebled to nine worth USD 3.82 billion in 2017, but sharply declined in 2018 to just USD 700 million by two issuers. The next year saw nine issuances worth around USD 3 billion, 2020 had just three companies raising USD 1.27 billion and USD 6.24 billion in 2021, totalling USD 17.2 billion by 41 issuers.  According to a report by CEEW Centre for Energy Finance, domestic renewable energy developers have issued green bonds worth Rs 26,300 crore in the first half, a record. The report said renewable energy players since 2014 raised Rs 78,200 crore or over USD 11 billion in green bonds (70 per cent of which was by Greenko and Renew Power) and directly refinanced debt for over 10 GW worth of renewable power projects.  Of this wind and solar power account for 42 per cent each of this refinanced portfolio and represents a combined 8.4 GW and hydropower makes up the balance.",

        "articleBody": "Lower cost of energy is key to the economy's growth and India should focus on developing disruptive technologies to keep the cost competitive and meet the goal of decarbonisation by 2050, former Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Anil Kakodkar said on Wednesday.  Speaking at an online event organised as part of the Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council's (TIFAC) tech talk series, he stressed on the need for rapid deployment of pressurised heavy water reactors which are indigenous, very competitive, and deliver high performance, as well as strategies for deployment of light water reactors and for cogeneration of hydrogen.   Clean energy supply would rise 120 to 140 times, and this increase has to come primarily through solar, wind, and nuclear. Share of electricity would go up primarily for e-mobility,  said Kakodkar, the former chairman of TIFAC, an institution under the Department of Science and Technology.   Surplus biomass can be converted to hydrogen or hydrogen substitutes for use in industry and transportation. Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) is inevitable for transition to low carbon economy,  he added.  He said thrust areas for further strategies for decarbonisation include hydrogen and electric mobility, conversion of surplus agricultural residue, solar, wind, and nuclear energy to hydrogen or hydrocarbons, non-fossil heating, and refrigeration and conversion of coal to fluid fuel to minimise energy import bill.  They also include CCU to minimise emission and enhancement of domestic petrochemicals production to meet demand and improve the balance of payment as well as energy security, he said.   Critical technologies to enable circular economy around hydrocarbon fuels and life cycle management of energy systems include steam electrolysis, thermochemical splitting of water, solar thermal, energy storage technologies, production of hydro-carbon substitutes using hydrogen and bio-mass and CCU technologies,  Kakodkar said.",

        "articleBody": "Delays in payments to renewable energy (RE) developers besides slow progress in the signing of power purchase and sale agreements by procurers are among the key challenges constraining the growth of the sector, according to Icra.Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President and Co-Group Head, ICRA Ratings, said, the investment prospects in the RE sector are expected to remain strong, given the policy impetus with a target to reach 450 GW by the financial year 2030, and competitive tariffs. The capacity addition in the power sector over the medium term will be driven by the RE segment, led by a strong project pipeline of close to 40 GW as of date.However  the key challenges constraining the growth remain on execution front, mainly associated with land and transmission infrastructure as well as the slow but improving progress in signing of power purchase agreements (PPAs) and power sale agreements (PSAs) by intermediate procurers with state distribution utilities (discoms),  Kadam said in the Icra report.Besides the execution-related challenges, the RE developers are facing challenges arising from delays in payments from the state distribution utilities and grid curtailments as observed in few states, especially for the relatively higher tariff projects.In the report, Icra said the timely commissioning of new capacities remains important to meet the growing demand from the developers, given the current capacity constraints.Icra further said its outlook for the domestic RE sector is stably supported by the continued policy support from the Government of India, strong project pipeline, and superior tariff competitiveness offered by wind and solar power projects both in the utility and the open-access segments.The demand outlook for the domestic solar OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) remains favourable, with the strong policy support through the imposition of BCD (basic customs duty) on imported cells and modules, the notification of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, and a strong project pipeline from various schemes requiring the use of domestic modules, Icra added.It said that the non-inclusion of the overseas suppliers in the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) so far is also likely to support the demand for domestic module OEMs in the near term.The policy push is expected to improve the cost competitiveness of domestic OEMs and has led to new capacity announcements of more than 15-GW by various OEMs and the entry of new players.

        "articleBody": "The transition of automobiles towards electric mobility is inevitable and it is for the auto industry to make the change and drive it to make India a global leader in electric vehicles (EVs), Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Wednesday. Speaking at the annual convention of auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), Kant said in the next two years the cost of batteries will fall even further thereby bringing down the upfront cost of acquisition for consumers.   At Niti Aayog, we are taking all measures to boost innovation, efficiency and investments in the automobile sector, especially to bring down the initial upfront cost of EVs to the consumers. I am stressing on EVs because I'm a strong believer and a firm believer that this transition is inevitable,  he asserted.  He further said, we are a centre for compact car manufacturing. If we do not innovate, and if we do not make a radical transformation, we will lose this opportunity to become a leader in electric vehicle manufacturing.   Global battery costs have been declining, much faster than anticipated and therefore, EV economics have become favorable as battery costs decline, he added.  In the next two years, Kant said the cost of batteries will fall even further.   The writing is on the wall, and it's for the industry to make the inevitable change and drive it, and lead it, and make India a leader in the transition of mobility across the world,  he said.  The country has the potential to be the  champion  of two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers and long distance transport, including commercial vehicles with new technology of the future, he said.  Kant asked automobile manufacturers to expand investments in research and development to support electric mobility, which includes vehicle systems integration, motors and controls, power electronics and charging infrastructure.  Stating that India is a highly price sensitive market and Indians consumers are cost conscious, Kant said innovative business options such as battery swapping and leasing will reduce the upfront cost of batteries.  Also, he said India has immense potential to be a battery manufacturing leader of the world.   Despite the fact that we do not have nickel, cobalt and lithium, we can add up to 81 per cent of value of batteries in India,  Kant said, adding the government has also restructured the FAME II scheme to make it even favourable for electric two-wheeler consumers by reducing the upfront cost.  Leading two-wheeler manufacturers have reported a four-fold increase in sales, in the past three years in India around 5.17 lakh EVs have been registered in the market, Kant said.",

In a message to the auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) on its 61st Annual Convention, the Prime Minister also stated that India remained firmly committed to move forward with the goal of clean and modern mobility, while lauding the role of the industry in the country's progress.   The role of the automobile industry in India's economy and progress has been remarkable. From contributing significantly towards manufacturing to furthering exports, from creating numerous employment opportunities to adding to the ease of living for people, the sector has been a partner in India's growth story,  Modi wrote in his message which was read out by SIAM President Kenichi Ayukawa.  He further said,  Even during the nation's fight against COVID-19, the sensitive and active effort of the sector is deeply valued.   Stating that modernity in mobility brings about a positive impact in almost every industry and every sector of the country, Modi said,  The 21st century India remains firmly committed to move forward with the goal of clean and modern mobility. Holistic steps are being taken for the value chain associated with auto manufacturing so that the industry becomes more productive and sustainable.   He also reassured the auto industry that  all the stakeholders have an important role in our government's steadfast efforts to transform India into a global manufacturing hub .  Presence of manufacturing units of global automobile manufacturers in India is reflective of a thriving ecosystem, Modi added.  Reiterating that there are rapid changes taking place in technology, lifestyle and economy and old approaches and old practices have to be changed, he said  It is also crucial to protect our environment, resources and raw materials.   For this reason, Modi said,  India is not only emphasizing on exploring new possibilities but also encouraging a circular economy. Recently launched National Automobile Scrappage Policy exemplifies this vision.   The Prime Minister said as India celebrates the 75 years of Independence, the next 25 years are very important for the country.   We have to work together for the next generation infrastructure, world class manufacturing and new age technology. India is committed to providing its citizens with global standards in terms of quality and safety,  he asserted.",

The agreement was signed with The Public Authority for Special Economic Zones and Free Zones, a Government authority of Oman, an official statement said.In March 2021, The Oman Company for the Development of the Special Economic Zone at Duqm (Tatweer) and ACME Group signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to set up a large scale facility to produce Green Hydrogen and Green Ammonia. The plant will be an integrated facility using 3 GWp of solar and 0.5 GWp of wind energy to produce 2,400 TPD of green ammonia with an annual production of approx. 0.9 million tons. The facility is being built to export green ammonia to demand centres like Europe and Asia with an investment of approx $3.5 billion, the statement said.ACME Group Founder and Chairman Manoj K Upadhyay said, \u201cThe signing of land reservation agreement will allow us to kick start pre-construction activities. We have hired environmental consultants and owner\u2019s engineers Black & Veatch and we plan to start the construction at Oman as soon we commission our first green hydrogen and green ammonia plant at Bikaner in India. The plant in Oman would be developed in phases and the first phase is likely to be commissioned by end of 2022.\u201dACME Group is in the process of commissioning green hydrogen and green ammonia plant in Bikaner.Green hydrogen will be produced using 5 MWp, expandable to 10 MWp, from the solar plant, which is an integral part of the project. ACME Group has built a solar portfolio of 6 GWp. Of this, the Company currently holds a portfolio of 5.25 GWp that includes 2.2 GWp of operational capacity and another 3.05 GWp is under construction. These are spread across 12 states in India.",

No one is immune to the impact of climate change, but for India, this is a window of opportunity to lead the way and show how climate action is not a narrative of cost but one of sustainable economic growth. As India aspires to be a $5 trillion economy, it is not just foreign and domestic investments that will be key in driving growth, we must also take this opportunity to align our ambitions with climate choices,\u201d said Atul Dhawan, Chairperson, Deloitte India.The report added that if no action is taken on climate change, the average global temperatures could rise by 3\u00b0C or more by the end of this century.\u201cDeloitte\u2019s research also shows that if governments, businesses, and communities act boldly and rapidly in the next decade to address climate change, average global temperature rises can be limited to around 1.5\u00b0C by 2050 \u2013 a scenario that will minimise the impact of climate change for India and the rest of the world. At the same time, India can achieve significant economic growth by supplying the products, services, and financing the world will need to limit temperature increases,\u201d it added.\u201cWe need to transform the world\u2019s economies towards new, low-emission pathways and India is well positioned to play a leading role in this process globally. By making the right choices now, India could chart a more prosperous path towards a low-emission future, accelerating progress in the rest of the world by exporting key technologies, processes, and know-how,\u201d said Viral Thakker, Partner and Sustainability Leader, Deloitte India.",

India will complete its phase down of HFCs in 4 steps from 2032 onwards with cumulative reduction of 10% in 2032, 20% in 2037, 30% in 2042 and 80% in 2047.A full schedule for phase down of HFC - substances used extensively in air conditioning and refrigeration- will be devised after consultation with all the industry stakeholders by 2023.Amendments to the existing legislation framework, the Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Rules to allow appropriate control of the production and consumption of Hydrofluorocarbons to ensure compliance with the Kigali Amendment will be done by mid-2024It is expected that the HFC phase down will prevent the emission of up to 105 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases, helping to avoid up to 0.5 degree Celsius of global temperature rise by 2100, while continuing to protect the ozone layer.India became a Party to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer on 19 June 1992 and since then has ratified the amendments to the Montreal Protocol. Though the present approval of the Cabinet, India will be ratifying the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol for phase down of Hydrofluorocarbons.India has so far met the phase out targets of all the Ozone Depleting Substances as per the Montreal Protocol Schedule.

        "articleBody": "India is among a few G20 countries on track towards United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Paris Agreement goals and has taken decisive actions to tackle climate change, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday. The minister, in a meeting with COP 26 president-designate Alok Sharma, said the government is taking concrete steps and at appreciable speed to meet its commitments on the target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030.  She also said 100 GW of this renewable energy had already been achieved.  Among other important initiatives, she mentioned the extensive work done on Hydrogen Energy Mission.  The minister discussed various issues related to climate change and specifically COP 26 -- the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, a Finance Ministry statement said.  The UK will host the international climate conference COP 26 in November this year.  With regards to ongoing discussions on climate change in various fora, Sitharaman referring to the dialogue on climate justice spoke about the need to bring a sense of compassion towards the poor.  The Finance Minister expressed hope that the commitment made by the developed countries to provide USD 100 billion per year to developing countries would be achieved and was optimistic about a positive outcome on the new collective goals on finance in COP 26.  The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries at COP 21 in Paris, on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016.  Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degree Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.",

        "articleBody": "As terrible as many things in the world are, climate is unique in posing an existential threat to civilization. And it\u2019s horrifying that so many political figures are dead set against any serious action to address that threat.Despite that, there\u2019s still a chance that we\u2019ll do enough to avoid catastrophe \u2014 not because we\u2019ve grown wiser but because we\u2019ve been lucky. We used to believe that achieving big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would be difficult and expensive, although not nearly as costly as anti-environmentalists claimed. Over the past dozen years or so, however, we\u2019ve experienced a technological miracle. As nicely documented in an article by Max Roser, the costs of solar and wind power, once dismissed as foolish hippie fantasies, have plunged to the point that quite modest incentives could lead to a rapid reduction in use of fossil fuels.But was it really luck? Did this miracle \u2014 actually two miracles, since generating electricity from the sun and from the wind involve completely different technologies \u2014 just happen to arrive in our moment of need? Or was it a consequence of good policy decisions?The answer is that there\u2019s a pretty good case that policy \u2014 the Obama administration\u2019s investments in green energy and European subsidies, especially for offshore wind \u2014 played a central role.What\u2019s the justification for that conclusion? Start with the fact that neither wind nor solar power was a fundamentally new technology. Windmills have been in widespread use at least since the 11th century. Photovoltaic solar power was developed in the 1950s. And as far as I can tell, there haven\u2019t been any major scientific breakthroughs behind the recent dramatic decline in both technologies\u2019 costs.What we\u2019re looking at, instead, appears to be a situation in which growing use of renewable energy is itself driving cost reductions. For solar and wind, we\u2019ve seen a series of incremental improvements as energy companies gain experience, big reductions in the price of components as things like turbine blades go into mass production and so on. Renewables, as Roser points out, appear to be subject to learning curves, in which costs fall with cumulative production.And here\u2019s the thing: When an industry has a steep learning curve, government support can have huge positive effects. Subsidize such an industry for a few years, and its costs will fall with experience, and eventually it will reach a tipping point where its growth becomes self-sustaining and the subsidies are no longer needed.That\u2019s arguably what has happened, or is on the verge of happening, for renewable energy.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \u2014 the Obama stimulus \u2014 was mainly intended to address the collapse in demand that followed the 2008 financial crisis. It helped a lot but got a bad reputation all the same because it was underpowered and hence failed to produce rapid recovery. (And no, that\u2019s not hindsight. I was screaming about it at the time.) But it also included significant funding for green energy: tax breaks, subsidies, government loans and loan guarantees.Some of the projects the government backed went bad, and Republicans made political hay over the losses. But venture capitalists expect some of the businesses they back to fail; if that never happens, they aren\u2019t taking enough risks. Similarly, a government program aimed at advancing technology is bound to end up with some lemons; if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not extending the frontier.And in retrospect, it looks as if those Obama initiatives really did extend the frontier, pushing solar energy in particular from a high-cost technology with limited adoption to the point that it\u2019s often cheaper than traditional energy sources.Obama\u2019s policies also helped wind, but there I suspect that a lot of the credit goes to European governments, which heavily subsidized offshore wind projects early in the last decade.In short, there\u2019s a really good case to be made that government support for renewable energy created a cost miracle that might not have happened otherwise \u2014 and this cost miracle may be the key to saving us from utter climate catastrophe.",

Currently, most state commissions allow open access to large consumers buying one megawatt and above.The Power Ministry\u2019s draft rules on promoting renewable energy through Green Energy Open Access provide that any entity may purchase renewable energy through its own generation, open market, placing requisition with discoms, green hydrogen and renewable energy certificates.\u201cThe quantum of green hydrogen would be computed by considering the equivalence to the green hydrogen produced from one MWh of electricity from the renewable sources or its multiple,\u201d the rules said. Green hydrogen is the hydrogen produced using electricity from renewable sources.This comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission (NHM) in his Independence Day speech. He said that the government aims to make India a global hub for the production and export of green hydrogen. The ministry also proposes to remove restrictions on consumers who want to generate their own green energy. Presently, customers are prohibited to produce through captive generation more than the connected load.The interested entities can purchase green energy by placing a requisition with their distribution licensee, which shall procure such quantity of green energy and supply it.\u201cThe tariff for the green energy shall be determined by the appropriate commission, which may comprise of the average pooled power purchase cost of the renewable energy, cross-subsidy charges (if any) and service charges covering all prudent cost of the distribution licensee for providing the green energy,\u201d the draft said.The green tariff will include wheeling charges and cross subsidy charges but exempt additional surcharge, levied for the long-term capacity tied up by discom likely to remain underutilised due to open access.Any requisition for green energy from a distribution licensee shall be for a minimum period of one year, the draft said. The quantum of green energy shall be pre-specified for at least one year.The draft provides that appropriate electricity commissions shall put in place regulations to provide green energy open access to willing consumers. All applications for open access of green energy shall be granted within a maximum of 15 days.The Forum of Regulators shall prepare a common application format for the Green energy open access which shall be adopted by the commissions, it said.",

It is good to see India moving towards achieving its Paris goals. However, what is worrying is that the way the government is doubling down on coal power. It is no longer enough to just expand renewable energy and claim it as climate action,  Nandikesh Shivalingam, director, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said on Saturday. India's coal consumption should peak in the next few years and there needs to be a clear phaseout plan for coal power which includes rehabilitation of affected communities and restoration of degraded land, he said. While India is expanding its renewable energy capacity, it is also expanding its coal power plant fleet.  Achieving 40 per cent of non-fossil fuel installed capacity nine years ahead of the Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) target is an incredible achievement for our country. It is a testament to visionary policies and business dynamism,  Ulka Kelkar, Director-Climate Program, WRI India said. She, however, said India should avoid the risk of creating stranded assets as international financing for coal power projects is drying up. Renewable energy that powers green hydrogen will be the key to decarbonising difficult sectors like industrial processes, Kelkar added. Shweta Narayan from Advisor Healthy Energy Initiative India said India's efforts to meet its demand through addition of renewal energy is commendable and should be an inspiration for rest of the world, however, the gains from this effort will become meaningless given the present roadmap of expansion and addition of new coal-based power plants. The new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report is a clarion call for exiting fossil fuels, including coal. India's leadership in renewable energy (RE) will only shine when it fully moves away from fossil fuels that harm the climate and public health, she said. Averaged over the next 20 years, global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, according to the latest report by IPCC, a United Nations body. At the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world had agreed to limit the global temperature rise in this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.",

        "articleBody": "Uday Kotak, Outgoing President, CII, Sanjiv Bajaj, President-Designate, CII and Rishad Premji, Chairman, Wipro, in conversation with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at the CII annual conference. The FM said the industry has to be very proactive and partner with people for renewable energy capacities within India. She also said industry should partner with big ticket investors to bring chip manufacturing capacity into India.  Uday Kotak: All of us have been impressed by the government\u2019s ability to work both at the big picture as well as focus on the details. That is something for which I will give a lot of credit to the finance ministry. You have laid out the roadmap and comforted us both on growth and areas like privatisation and disinvestment in the context of your Budget last year as we look at the balance part of this year. But we are on the verge of the 74th independence day. What would you like to see achieved on 75 years of independence next year?If I can risk it, I will say Atmanirbhar Bharat. I did not use that word during my talk because many of the things that we are doing are aiming at achieving it and so there was not much of a point for me to say it. I thought I should lay down all the steps which I am taking towards being Atmanirbhar before you. Now that you asked me this question, I would actually want India to be Atmanirbhar on a few things like renewable energy so that our dependence on fossil fuel is brought to a minimum.  That is one thing on which I want the industry to be very proactive about and engage in such a way that you are able to partner yourself with people for renewable energy capacities within India. If you are able to bring down the dependence on fossil fuel and build capacities within India to build renewable energy and also manufacture those things which are required -- be it films or solar panels. This will allow us to build capacities in renewable energy so that the dependence on fossil fuel is brought to a minimum. Therefore, when I say reliance on renewable energy, I mean we will have to produce those things which are raw materials for establishing renewable production, energy production places. We do not need to be big in renewable energy, but we shouldn\u2019t have to depend on films and panels from outside.  Secondly, since we are leaders and should continue to be leaders in using technology, we need to have chip manufacturing coming into India. I would certainly want industry to understand this and make sure that by partnering with big ticket investors, we can bring in chip manufacturing capacity into India. Thirdly, you are aware that the prime minister has announced a hydrogen mission and it is a long term investment. We need to understand the multifaceted capacity that a hydrogen mission can have. We need to have capacities built in India and therefore I am laying a lot of stress on Atmanirbharta in the energy sector. If we are able to climb on to that bus, many things will be addressed in India. Otherwise, we will pay through our nose for fossil fuel which in turn affects our environment and we are paying for it but affecting ourselves and affecting our economy and the environment. So that is one thing which I would lay emphasis on.Sanjiv Bajaj: Last year, huge support came from the government on the fiscal and monetary side. Many countries around the world did the same. Now the US, with its high levels of vaccination penetration and high growth of the economy already being apparent, has started talking about the sun setting on the excess liquidity. How do you see this going for us? Would it be fair to expect continued support going into next year? We have not reached that level yet.Nirmala Sitharaman: Yes, absolutely. I do not think we have reached that level and I am glad that the RBI has been voicing that understanding that too quick retrieval or sucking out of the liquidity from the economy may not do the necessary stimulus which is required. I am glad that the RBI has kept that understanding and they have not given any indication about wanting to suck out the liquidity which is available there. Rishad Premji: I have two specific questions on behalf of the IT industry; the first is on promoting R&D and innovation. As you are aware, many advanced countries have mechanisms through matching grants and incentives to promote innovation across industries in advanced technologies. Is there any thinking to encourage research in emerging technologies on similar lines? The second question is on tax. As you may be aware, there are many open tax issues which are repetitive in nature and have been lingering for the IT industry over the last 20 years. In 2013 there was an attempt made through the Rangachary committee to address some of these issues but they still remain unresolved. Would you be open to an idea of setting up a committee under the CBDT like a mediation committee to try and address some of these long pending litigation issues?Nirmala Sitharaman: Your second question first; let me have from you a list of all those issues which you think are lingering still post the committee which was set up in 2013. I am not for a moment denying that whatever you are saying are probably lingering but I would want to get an idea of what are those issues which you want to list out and say that this has never been addressed since 2013. I would like to see them. Once I see them, I will be able to take a call whether I need a committee for it or is there a way in which I can have the present board and address those issues because a committee after all has gone through it in 2013. If there are no issues but the old ones remain pending, I do not need another committee to sit over it, I just need to give decisions.  So let me have a list from you, please. As regards the R&D for services sector and largely when you talk of services you are talking of IT, I am not sure I will be the person to speak about what specific R&D that you are referring to or I may want to refer to. I would want to have the MeitY, the Ministry of Electronics and IT to be able to tell me about it and also industry to be more specific in saying what is it that you want now.  If you need help, we need to extend the help but since after the STPI and everything, India showed brilliant success in setting up large ecosystems for IT industry and different layers have happened from the backroom BPOs to providing project based solutions to moving further today now reaching a stage with R&D.  I want to understand what is the nature of support you expect from the government because the industry once it reaches a certain level, determines its contours like bio pharma today. Bengaluru is a big centre. You are familiar with it and the bio biosimilars that they are doing. They are doing a lot of work on their own but of course the kind of support which they require from us is fairly well defined and therefore it is possible for us to quickly ramp up and respond. So please write to me, please send me something more specific, let me respond.",

        "articleBody": "Kolkata-based mining and minerals group Atha plans to exit their clean energy business by selling 365 MW assets spread across seven states. The proposed deal is likely to value the assets at an enterprise value of Rs2000 crore, said multiple people aware of the development.Avendus Capital is advising Atha Group on the sale process. Feelers were sent to players such as O2 Power, Ayana Power, Edelweiss Infrastructure and a handful of private equity investors.Atha has 200 MW assets in Tamil Nadu, 15 MW in Telangana, 20 MW in Karnataka, 50 MW in Maharashtra and the rest is in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The bids are expected to be in by 25 of this month, said one among the sources. As part of the continued process of evaluation of various businesses, we have appointed Avendus to look for suitable options regarding our renewable energy portfolio,  said Atha spokesperson. But, at this juncture, we would not be in position to divulge anything further on the matter, he added.In 2017, Atha Group companies \u2013 Narbheram Vishram and NVR Energy had won the bid to supply 200MW of solar power to Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO), out of the 2000 MW capacity sought to be developed by TANGEDCO.The 60-year old Atha Group is diversified into iron-ore mining, power & steel and Calcined petroleum coke, besides renewable energy.Indian clean energy platform Ayana Renewable Power is backed by UK's CDC Group, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and EverSource Capital. O2 Power is backed by Singapore-government owned Temasek and Swedish private equity company EQT Infrastructure.Several conventional power producers have been selling a large portfolio of assets in the last few years. Major buyers are the marquee private equity funds -backed renewable platforms.On Wednesday, Larsen & Toubro had sold its 99 mw run-of-the river hydroelectric power plant in Uttarakhand to ReNew Power for Rs 985 crore. With a capacity of 10GW, Renew Power is backed by Goldman Sachs, CPP Investments, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and JERA. In April, Azure Power had sold its non-core solar rooftop portfolio to Radiance Renewables, backed by Eversource Capital, for Rs 536 crore.Acme Solar had sold 400 MW assets to PE fund Actis and 100 MW assets to Malaysia\u2019s state-run oil and gas company, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) last year.India has attracted investments to the tune of Rs 1.32 lakh crore in the renewable energy sector in the past three years since 2017. At present, India\u2019s installed renewable energy capacity is about 95 GW including 40.5 GW of solar power.India\u2019s renewable energy (RE) capacity addition is expected to improve to 10.5 GW to 11 GW in financial year 2021-22 led by a strong project pipeline of about 38 GW, according to ratings agency ICRA.The RE sector is expected to witness investments of Rs 3.5 trillion over the next four years, increasing the share of RE capacity to 34 per cent of the overall installed capacity by March 2025 from 25 per cent as of March 2021 led by the solar power segment, the report added. There was a slowdown in RE capacity addition to 7.4 GW in FY21 from 8.7 GW in FY20 amid the execution headwinds due to Covid-19.India added a total solar and wind power capacity of only 4,908 megawatt (MW) in 2020, the lowest in the past five years, according to Bridge to India. In 2015, the government had declared an ambitious target of 175 GW from renewables by 2022.",

        "articleBody": "Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari will soon approach the Reserve Bank of India on suggestions to use India\u2019s foreign reserves towards building infrastructure. Gadkari, who is the minister for road transport and highways was speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry Annual session 2021 on Wednesday. \u201cWe have a surplus of dollar reserves in the country,\u201d Gadkari said. \u201cI am going to talk with the Reserve Bank governor about how we can formulate a policy whereby we can use these foreign exchange reserves for development of infrastructure in the country at a low cost,\u201d he said. Gadkari said his ministry is also open to formulating new policies for bringing in foreign investment in highway construction. He added that the National Highways Authority of India needs financial institutions to reduce the rate of interest for infrastructure projects. \u201cIf there are some foreign investors who are ready to invest in road construction and are ready to give me (NHAI) a loan in dollars but hedging will be their responsibility, I am ready to make some new system to use foreign investments for that,\u201d he said. Speaking of the transport ministry\u2019s focus on electric mobility and alternative fuels, Gadkari said that construction companies should stop the use of diesel in equipment and switch to electric, and other cleaner fuels, which will also lead to cost saving. He said that NHAI and the highways ministry can offer special mobilisation advances for purchasing machinery on electric, ethanol and alternate fuels. \u201cDon\u2019t use diesel as fuel, that\u2019s my request to all contractors,\u201d he said. Gadkari further pointed out bureaucratic delays in the system. \u201cThe present system in the government is orthodox, conservative and not ready for any change,\u201d he said. He said that such attitudes must change for faster and more effective implementation of policies. On GPS-based tolling, Gadkari said that within the next three months, the technology for replacing toll plazas in the country will be finalised, which is going to save us hundreds of crores and make travel hassle-free for the commuters.

MNRE in association with UNIDO and GEF launched the loan interest subvention scheme for demonstration of innovative industrial organic waste to energy biomethanation projects and business models. A GIS-based inventory tool of organic waste streams was also unveiled,  an official release said.GIS refers to Geographic Information System.According to the release, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and MNRE launched the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-funded loan interest subvention scheme that provides financial assistance to innovative waste to energy biomethanation projects and business models.Innovations in such projects seek to improve overall energy output thereby minimising the cost of energy generation but may lead to an increase in the initial project cost at the establishment stage yet increase revenue and reduce operating costs over project's lifetime, the release said.The loan scheme provides financial assistance to beneficiaries to reduce the financial burden on account of interest on the loan component faced by such demonstration projects.A GIS-based inventory tool of organic waste streams developed under the GEF-MNRE-UNIDO project was also launched during a webinar.The tool provides district level estimates of available urban and industrial organic wastes and their energy generation potential across India.The tool will enable SMEs and project developers to set up new waste to energy projects and may facilitate the rapid growth of biomethanation in waste-to-energy sector in the country.",

        "articleBody": "India must act now or else, the stronger effects of climate change will continue, environmental experts said on Tuesday, calling for the country to focus on a rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and building resilient infrastructure to tackle the increasing impacts of extreme weather events, as warned in the latest IPCC report. The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), approved by the 195 member countries, cautioned that every region on earth will witness the worst irreversible effects of climate change in the coming years, including sea-level rise and a surge in heat waves, rainfall and floods. In a written response to PTI, Krishna Achuta Rao, one of the authors of the report, said the stronger effects of climate change will continue till the time the emissions are zeroed out.  The corrective steps to prevent further climate change are the same for India and the rest of the world -- to reduce emissions of GHGs, especially carbon-dioxide, and reduce them rapidly. There are hard decisions to be taken to achieve this.  The message is also clear that we are already experiencing the effects of climate change and will continue to experience stronger effects till such time the emissions are zeroed out, which means that we have to pay attention to how we adapt to these changes so the worst effects of climate change on our population, economy and infrastructure are minimised,  Rao said. Sharing a similar view, T S Panwar, Director, Climate Change and Energy Programme, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF India), said with the increase in global warming, devastating consequences of delayed climate action can be seen across the world.  India is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and will be significantly impacted due to the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones, heat waves, forest fires and droughts.  Since the window of action has narrowed down further, India needs to mainstream climate action, accelerate adaptation efforts across sectors and build resilience capacity,  he said, adding that the country should also keep up its efforts towards sustainable development and embrace innovative solutions that reduce GHG emissions. Calling for strong and bold steps, Avinash Chanchal, Senior Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India, said the country needs to take urgent measures to limit temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius and move away from any future investment into fossil fuels.  India has already taken a few progressive steps like the ambitious target of clean energy can indeed contribute to tackle the climate crisis. But it also needs to move away from opening future investment into fossil fuels,  he said. Noting that the report provides enough information about how human activities are causing climate change, making heat waves, droughts and heavy rainfall more frequent and severe, Chanchal said India is one of the most vulnerable countries for these extreme climatic events.  We are already witnessing these events at regular intervals. This human-made climate change is not only impacting nature and our biodiversity, but it has a huge impact on human health and the economy as well. The coastal areas are already dealing with the effects of sea-level rise, which will only increase if we fail to solve the problem of increasing temperatures,  he said, adding that governments and big corporations must shift to cheaper and cleaner energy sources.  Governments and big corporations must understand that development cannot continue on dead (fossil) fuels anymore, especially when science has already brought sustainable alternatives to our doorstep. With a cheaper clean energy source, we can certainly get 100 per cent renewable energy in the transport, electricity and industry sectors,  he said.  As far as India is concerned, we have a double burden now. We have to build resilience in our economy, infrastructure and social systems to deal with the increasing impacts of extreme weather events. At the same time, we have to act on mitigation measures,  said Chandra Bhushan, president and CEO, International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iFOREST). Chanchal shared a similar view.  While taking strong and bold steps to mitigate the climate crisis, the government should also invest in preparedness, risk management and ensure measures for adaptation...this is the time when India could lead the path and give a strong message to the global community that this is the moment to rise up, scale up and speed up climate action,  he said. The climate experts stressed that the timelines in the latest IPCC report are more definitive as it has projected that the global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2040, which renews the urgency for collective climate action.  Previously, IPPC's special report in 2018 had projected that global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052. The timelines have now been made more definitive, with the new IPCC assessment finding that the global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2040.  Importantly, the scientific evidence in the report unequivocally finds human influence to have warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. These estimates renew the urgency for collective climate action ahead of the COP26 scheduled for November, as close to 1.5 degrees Celsius or even 2 degrees Celsius will be beyond reach if countries fail to achieve immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,  Bhushan said.",

        "articleBody": "India plans to force refineries and fertiliser plants to use some green hydrogen, junior oil minister Rameswar Teli said on Monday, as Asia's third-largest economy strives to reduce carbon emissions. Governments and energy companies around the world are betting on clean hydrogen playing a leading role in efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions, though its future uses and costs remain uncertain. India's draft hydrogen policy will mandate a gradual increase in the use of green hydrogen instead of fossil fuels in refineries and fertiliser plants, Teli told lawmakers in a written reply to questions.  He did not give details, but noted green hydrogen is yet to be produced in India on a commercial scale due to the high cost of production.  Green hydrogen is a zero-carbon fuel made by electrolysis, using renewable power from wind and solar to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Power minister R. K. Singh told lawmakers last week that the draft National Hydrogen Mission policy, prepared by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, was under ministerial consultation. The policy aims to boost green hydrogen production and its use across multiple sectors, including transportation, he said.  India is already encouraging the use of hydrogen as a transport fuel, with some buses running on hydrogen blended fuel on a trial basis. Last week, Indian Railways invited bids to explore if diesel-fuel trains could operate using hydrogen.  Fertiliser minister Mansukh Mandaviya said last month the use of green hydrogen would cut imports of ammonia and natural gas required for fertiliser production. The draft policy wants green hydrogen to account for 10% of the overall hydrogen needs of refiners from 2023/24, rising to 25% in five years, a government source said. The respective requirements for the fertiliser sector are 5% and 20%, he added. India is raising its renewable energy capacity, currently 92.97 gigawatts (GW), to meet about two-fifth of its electricity needs by 2030 under the Paris climate accord, compared with 36.7% currently.  It wants to raise renewable energy capacity to 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.  India's top refiner Indian Oil Corp, top power utility NTPC Ltd and conglomerates including Reliance and Adani have announced plans to build green hydrogen projects.",

        "articleBody": "Earth's climate is getting so hot that temperatures in about a decade will probably blow past a level of warming that world leaders have sought to prevent, according to a report released Monday that the United Nations called a ``code red for humanity.''``It's just guaranteed that it's going to get worse,'' said report co-author Linda Mearns, a senior climate scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. ``Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.''But scientists also eased back a bit on the likelihood of the absolute worst climate catastrophes.The authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which calls climate change clearly human-caused and ``unequivocal,'' makes more precise and warmer forecasts for the 21st century than it did last time it was issued in 2013.Each of five scenarios for the future, based on how much carbon emissions are cut, passes the more stringent of two thresholds set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. World leaders agreed then to try to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above levels in the late 19th century because problems mount quickly after that. The world has already warmed nearly 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past century and a half.Under each scenario, the report said, the world will cross the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming mark in the 2030s, earlier than some past predictions. Warming has ramped up in recent years, data shows.``Our report shows that we need to be prepared for going into that level of warming in the coming decades. But we can avoid further levels of warming by acting on greenhouse gas emissions,'' said report co-chair Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a climate scientist at France's Laboratory of Climate and Environment Sciences at the University of Paris-Saclay.In three scenarios, the world will also likely exceed 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times _ the other, less stringent Paris goal _ with far worse heat waves, droughts and flood-inducing downpours ``unless deep reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades,'' the report said.``This report tells us that recent changes in the climate are widespread, rapid and intensifying, unprecedented in thousands of years,'' said IPCC Vice Chair Ko Barrett, senior climate adviser for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The 3,000-plus-page report from 234 scientists said warming is already accelerating sea level rise and worsening extremes such as heat waves, droughts, floods and storms. Tropical cyclones are getting stronger and wetter, while Arctic sea ice is dwindling in the summer and permafrost is thawing. All of these trends will get worse, the report said.For example, the kind of heat wave that used to happen only once every 50 years now happens once a decade, and if the world warms another degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), it will happen twice every seven years, the report said.As the planet warms, places will get hit more not just by extreme weather but by multiple climate disasters at once, the report said. That's like what's now happening in the Western U.S., where heat waves, drought and wildfires compound the damage, Mearns said. Extreme heat is also driving massive fires in Greece and Turkey.Some harm from climate change _ dwindling ice sheets, rising sea levels and changes in the oceans as they lose oxygen and become more acidic _ is ``irreversible for centuries to millennia,'' the report said.The world is ``locked in'' to 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) of sea level rise by mid-century, said report co-author Bob Kopp of Rutgers University.Scientists have issued this message for more than three decades, but the world hasn't listened, said United Nations Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen.Nearly all of the warming that has happened on Earth can be blamed on emissions of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. At most, natural forces or simple randomness can explain one- or two-tenths of a degree of warming, the report said.The report described five different future scenarios based on how much the world reduces carbon emissions. They are: a future with incredibly large and quick pollution cuts; another with intense pollution cuts but not quite as massive; a scenario with moderate emission cuts; a fourth scenario where current plans to make small pollution reductions continue; and a fifth possible future involving continued increases in carbon pollution.In five previous reports, the world was on that final hottest path, often nicknamed ``business as usual.'' But this time, the world is somewhere between the moderate path and the small pollution reductions scenario because of progress to curb climate change, said report co-author Claudia Tebaldi, a scientist at the U.S. Pacific Northwest National Lab.While calling the report ``a code red for humanity,'' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres kept a sliver of hope that world leaders could still somehow prevent 1.5 degrees of warming, which he said is ``perilously close.''There is also a way for the world to stay at the 1.5-degree threshold with extreme and quick emission cuts, but even then, temperatures would rise 1.5 degrees Celsius in a decade and even beyond, before coming back down, said co-author Maisia Rojas Corrada, director of the Center for Climate and Resilience Research in Chile.``Anything we can do to limit, to slow down, is going to pay off,'' Tebaldi said. ``And if we cannot get to 1.5, it's probably going to be painful, but it's better not to give up.''In the report's worst-case scenario, the world could be around 3.3 degrees Celsius (5.9 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than now by the end of the century. But that scenario looks increasingly unlikely, said report co-author and climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, climate change director of the Breakthrough Institute.``We are a lot less likely to get lucky and end up with less warming than we thought,'' Hausfather said. ``At the same time, the odds of ending up in a much worse place than we expected if we do reduce our emissions are notably lower.''A ``major advance'' in the understanding of how fast the world warms with each ton of carbon dioxide emitted allowed scientists to be far more precise in the scenarios in this report, Mason-Delmotte said.The report said ultra-catastrophic disasters _ commonly called ``tipping points,'' like ice sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents _ are ``low likelihood'' but cannot be ruled out. The much talked-about shutdown of Atlantic ocean currents, which would trigger massive weather shifts, is something that's unlikely to happen in this century, Kopp said.The report ``provides a strong sense of urgency to do even more,'' said Jane Lubchenco, the White House deputy science adviser.In a new move, scientists emphasized how cutting airborne levels of methane _ a powerful but short-lived gas that has soared to record levels _ could help curb short-term warming. Lots of methane the atmosphere comes from leaks of natural gas, a major power source. Livestock also produces large amounts of the gas, a good chunk of it in cattle burps.More than 100 countries have made informal pledges to achieve ``net zero'' human-caused carbon dioxide emissions sometime around mid-century, which will be a key part of climate negotiations this fall in Scotland. The report said those commitments are essential.``It is still possible to forestall many of the most dire impacts,'' Barrett said.",

        "articleBody": "The government is set to make it mandatory for user industries to produce or procure green hydrogen to meet part of their needs, a move that has the potential to make India one of the largest producers of what is being seen as a 'fuel of the future' that will play a key role in energy transition and carbon reduction.Oil refineries and fertiliser manufacturers will be asked to implement the policy immediately after the Cabinet approves the proposal, power and renewable energy minister R K Singh told in an interview.He said the renewable energy ministry has sent the proposal for Cabinet approval after discussing with pertinent ministries. The proposal, on the lines of renewable energy purchase obligation for electricity distribution companies, is at the centre of Singh's energy transition and carbon reduction blueprint.According to the policy, starting 2023-24, refineries will have to use green hydrogen for meeting 10% of their requirement. This will rise to 25% in five years. Fertiliser makers will start with 5% green hydrogen, which will go up to 20%. The proposal for the Cabinet also seeks approval to extend the policy to other industries at a later stage.The policy will be applied to industries such as steel and the transport sector gradually as the market evolves.  Currently refineries and other user industries produce grey hydrogen from natural gas. This method produces CO2. The policy will create a market for green hydrogen, which in turn will attract investments in its production,  Singh said. Today, wheeling of renewable energy is free. Companies can bring renewable energy from anywhere to produce green hydrogen. The cost impact will be negligible. Going by our estimates, India can be one of the largest producers of green hydrogen in the world,  he added.Steel industry is likely to be brought under the policy's ambit in two years as major changes are required in their set up. But they will have to do it to reduce their carbon footprint and avoid carbon tax on exports to the developed economies, one official said. IndianOil, RIL, JSW and NTPC have made plans to set up green hydrogen facilities.Hydrogen has wide application in manufacturing and is now being looked at as a clean mobility solution. Green hydrogen is the cleanest fuel as it is produced through electrolysis using renewable energy. The colours denote the process through which it is obtained.",

        "articleBody": "The world faces a growing paradox in the campaign to contain climate change. The harder it pushes the transition to a greener economy, the more expensive the campaign becomes, and the less likely it is to achieve its aim, to limit the worst effects of global warming.New government-directed spending is driving up demand for materials needed to build a cleaner economy. At the same time, tightening regulation is limiting supply by discouraging investment in mines, smelters, oil fields, or any source that belches carbon. The unintended result is greenflation \u2013 rising prices for metals and minerals such as copper, aluminum and lithium, which are essential to solar and wind power, electric cars, batteries and other renewable technologies.In the past, the transition to a new energy source provided a big boost to the old one. The advent of steam power inspired the makers of sailing ships to innovate more in 50 years than they had in the previous 300. Electricity had a similar impact on gas lighting. Now, building green economies will consume more oil in the transition period, but producers aren\u2019t responding the same way because political and regulatory resistance has darkened the future of fossil fuels.Even as oil prices rise, investment by the big hydrocarbon companies and countries continues to fall, as it has for nearly a decade. Instead, oil powers are reinventing themselves as clean energy powers. One broker recently wrote that of his firm\u2019s 400 institutional clients, only one is still willing to invest in oil and gas. Even in shale oil, a corner of the market dominated by private players, rising prices are triggering an unusually weak increase in supply.Limiting supply threatens to raise what Bill Gates calls the \u201cgreenium\u201d \u2013 the premium the world must be prepared to pay for climate-friendly infrastructure. And the pressure keeps growing.The most important metals for green electrification are copper and its sometime substitute, aluminum. But investment in these green metals has also been depressed by ESG \u2013 environmental, social and governance issues. The world needs more copper to stop global warming, but environmentalists recently helped block a new Alaska mine over rival concerns: The impact on local communities and salmon.The ESG movement used to be a luxury of rich nations. No longer. These pressures are also restraining supplies even from Latin America, once the wild west of global mining. Forty per cent of the world\u2019s copper supply comes from the two largest producers, Chile and Peru, and in both countries mining projects that used to take five years can now take ten or more.One big project in Peru, the Tia Maria copper mine, was scheduled to open in 2011 but remains unfinished owing to resistance from the local community. This year alone, Chile has adopted two sweeping environmental rules and is considering a new royalty that could make some of its biggest mines unprofitable. One need not take sides in these conflicts to see that higher regulatory hurdles could be sharply inflationary.China\u2019s role as a major commodity supplier has also been turned on its head. A decade ago, China was still over producing raw materials like iron ore and steel and dumping the excess at cutthroat prices in foreign markets. Now, Beijing has cut production as part of its campaign to reach carbon neutrality. Nearly 60% of aluminum comes from China, which recently capped new smelting because of its fat carbon footprint.This certainly looked like the green thing to do. Aluminum is one of the dirtiest metals to produce, as bad as iron ore. Yet it is also one of the metals most vital to solar and other green energy projects. And it is set to face a particularly sharp increase in demand, as much as tripling in the next three decades, according to World Bank forecasts.If every time the world faces this kind of trade-off, it chooses to block new supply, it won\u2019t be able to meet rising demand for green construction materials.In the 2000s, analysts were bullish on commodity prices, owing to demand from China and its ambitious plans for new highway, factory and building construction. Now, if they are bullish it is because of increasing demand from green projects. The green economy is the new China.Renewable technologies require more wiring than the fossil fuel variety. Solar or wind power plants and electric cars use two to six times more copper than the technologies they aim to replace.Over the last 18 months, as the United States joined China in committing to carbon neutrality, and many governments announced new green spending plans, analysts steadily increased their estimates for growth in demand for copper and other green metals.Green regulation is thus spurring demand as it tightens supply, fuelling greenflation. Since the low point early last year, copper prices are up by more than 100%, aluminum by 75%. And unusually, their upward climb has barely weakened with recent signs of waning momentum in global growth.Solving this conundrum \u2013 how to supply enough dirty old material to build a new green economy \u2013 will require balance. Blocking new mines and oil rigs won\u2019t always be the environmentally and socially responsible move. Governments, and greens in particular, need to recognise that trying to shut down the old economy too fast threatens to push the price of building a cleaner one out of reach.",

        "articleBody": "India is pushing for more cars to run on ethanol made from sugar, a move that risks raising the cost of the sweetener globally.The government will fast-track an ethanol program that will divert as much as 6 million tons of sugar toward fuel production annually by 2025, according to the food ministry. That\u2019s almost the entire amount that India, the world\u2019s second-biggest producer after Brazil, currently exports to the global market.Prime Minister Narendra Modi advanced in June a target for blending 20% ethanol in gasoline to 2025, five years earlier than planned. The advantages are multifold: it will reduce air pollution, cut India\u2019s oil import bills, help soak up a domestic sugar glut and increase investment in rural areas.India, the world\u2019s second-biggest producer and grappling with massive stockpiles, is set to miss its goal for sugar exports this year because of a late start to shipments and logistical challenges, potentially providing further fuel to the sweetener's blistering rally.85088915For the rest of the world, the move may be the biggest change in years for the sugar industry and could drive a bull market, according to Czapp, Czarnikow\u2019s new portal for agri-food analysis. Prices have soared to the highest since 2017 amid a supply crunch, partly due to wild weather in Brazil. A further surge will add to food inflation risks, with global food costs already near a decade high.It\u2019s \u201cgood news for the world if India diverts sugar to produce more ethanol as it will reduce the global surplus,\u201d said Rahil Shaikh, managing director of Meir Commodities India Pvt, a trading company. \u201cBut eventually if there is higher demand, some countries including India will have to expand cane acreage.\u201dTo meet its 2025 target, India will have to almost triple ethanol production to about 10 billion liters a year, according to the country\u2019s oil secretary Tarun Kapoor. This will require $7 billion of investment and the challenge would be to create the kind of capacity needed in a short span of three to four years.The government is offering financial support to sugar mills to set up or expand distilleries. Companies including Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd. will stop producing sugar at some mills and begin processing cane juice to make ethanol instead.India is pursuing a similar strategy to Brazil, which has promoted sugarcane-based ethanol for more than 40 years to ease its sugar glut, cut dependency on oil imports and increase energy security. Today, Brazil owns the largest fleet of flex-fuel cars that can run on any blend of ethanol and gasoline.India will allow production of ethanol-based flex engines too, the Press Trust of India reported. Higher use of biofuels in transport can ease India\u2019s economic burden from high crude prices and help the third-largest oil importer save $4 billion annually, according to government estimates.\u201cThey will kill two birds with one stone,\u201d said Michael McDougall, the New York-based managing director of Paragon Global Markets. \u201cIt is a move in the right direction.\u201dThe plan will also cut India\u2019s sugar export subsidies by about $500 million. The government helps cash-strapped mills to boost shipments as a way to support local prices and increase export competitiveness. Rivals including Brazil and Australia have complained about the subsidies to the World Trade Organization.This year, India is set to export a record amount of sugar again with the help of subsidies. Volumes are forecast at 6.5 million tons.\u201cThe surplus will be small after 2025 and the need to export will not remain at such high levels,\u201d said Abinash Verma, director general of Indian Sugar Mills Association. \u201cDepending on domestic and global prices, there may still be small quantities of exports,\u201d he said, declining to give a forecast.",

An immediate acceleration in funding is needed if we are to get on track for global net zero.\u201dThe growth was boosted by a record first half for new money raised on public markets, which hit $28.2 billion, up more than fivefold from the same period last year. Commitments to renewable energy companies by venture capital and private equity also rose.Investment in solar projects was up 9% to a record $78.9 billion in the first half. Solar projects in China garnered $4.9 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.8 billion in the first quarter.However, investment in wind projects fell to $58 billion, down more than 30% compared with the same period last year when developers were rushing to take advantage of expiring support mechanisms in China and the U.S.",

A foreign news agency has reported that India and China have missed the deadline of July 30 set by the United Nations (UN) to provide an update on their plans for curbing the release of planet-warming gases. Dismissing the report, Environment Secretary R P Gupta said,  India has no such commitment of making and declaring fresh targets. We have not signed any such agreement.  According to the report, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa welcomed that 110 signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met the cut-off date, which was extended from the end of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But she said it was  far from satisfactory  that only 58 per cent of the signatories had submitted their new targets in time, the report said. Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria and 82 other nations also failed to update their nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) for the UN to include the input in a report it is preparing for an international climate change conference in November, the report claimed.  Espinosa noted that a previous report found countries were doing too little to meet the goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times. The more ambitious target of capping warming at 1.5C (2.7F) is far out of reach,  the report said.",

        "articleBody": "The refrain to justify not moving away from fossil fuels has been that it would put people out of work. Coal and petroleum are big employers. India alone has about 8.6 lakh energy jobs now. But a new study has found that phasing out fossil fuels would actually add 80 lakh energy sector jobs across the world by 2050, of which over 5.4 lakh would be in India. \u201cClimate action results in more jobs,\u201d Dr Sandeep Pai, co-author of the paper published in \u2018One Earth\u2019 journal on Friday, told TOI. Data he shared show that if the Paris Agreement target of temperature rise staying well below 2\u00b0C werema met, the number of jobs in India\u2019s energy sector would go up from 8.6 lakh to 14 lakh by 2050. The rest of South Asia, meanwhile, would add about 69,000 jobs. China, on the other hand, would lose over 27 lakh jobs. \u201cAccording to our study, the US and Middle East and North Africa are clear winners in terms of adding maximum numbers of jobs. They all add over a million jobs by 2050,\u201d Pai said. The reason this happens is because low-carbon technologies are more job-intensive. That would lead to an increase in the number of jobs, especially during the expansion of renewable energy capacity. \u201cThe emerging economies of Indonesia, South East Asia, Brazil, India, and South Asia currently have a large number of jobs in the fossil fuel sector ... In our WB2C (global temperature rise well below 2\u00b0C) scenarios, while their fossil fuel jobs decrease, the increase in energy demand and massive deployment of renewables leads to an overall rise in jobs,\u201d the paper said. 84881053But why the variation? \u201cJob number differences are a complex mix of changes in job intensity, energy demand, and differing impacts of economic drivers associated with these regions. These drivers include population, GDP, urbanization etc,\u201d Pai said. \u201cBut generally, China, which currently produces and consumes half of the world's coal, has over 6 million coal jobs. In the future, while this massive coal sector declines (and so do the associated jobs) and new renewable jobs are created, they are not enough to compensate for the losses in coal jobs. In India\u2019s case, the majority of Indian jobs are also in the coal sector (over 0.5 million) which decline but gains in renewable jobs more than make up for the lost jobs.\u201dThe study is the first based on a comprehensive dataset of over 50 countries, which the researchers combined with an integrated assessment model to make job projections. \u201cThere have been past studies on this but most of them used OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) datasets and applied regional multipliers to calculate job impacts in non-OECD countries,\u201d Pai said. \u201cThis was a big gap as India and China are the major fossil fuel and renewable energy producers. So, we wanted to fill this big knowledge gap \u2026 (Also), most of the global studies on energy transitions focus on technical and economic aspects of clean energy transitions but ignore the very important socio-economic factors associated with the transition. We wanted to highlight the human side or social impacts of energy transitions.\u201d",

        "articleBody": "For international investors seeking a piece of India\u2019s renewables boom -- and the bankers who sit across the table with them -- all roads go through the country\u2019s domestic energy players.That\u2019s the message from Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Gaurav Singhal, who leads the busiest team in India\u2019s green energy M&A sector in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest of the deals saw the U.S. bank advising SoftBank Group Corp. on selling its renewables business in India to Adani Green Energy Ltd. at an enterprise value of $3.5 billion earlier this year.The green energy arm of local tycoon Gautam Adani\u2019s empire announced the deal in May, following reports that negotiations with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board had fallen apart.Adani\u2019s group was a late entrant in the SB Energy deal, though they were aware of it, Singhal said. \u201cThe group had many advantages, from being a local player to the fact that some of the SB Energy assets were next door to their own plants.\u201dThe deal helped make India the most active market in the world for renewables M&A in the first six months of 2021 according to BloombergNEF, and Adani and his fellow billionaire, Mukesh Ambani, have unveiled ambitious plans in the sector.Foreign buyers will undoubtedly continue to compete for assets; Singhal expects more than $150 billion in equity investment into the sector by 2030. Yet most strategic investors from overseas are seeking to back local entrepreneurs, he said.84845953\u201cSome of the issues of dealing with the federal government can be handled by only the local partners,\u201d he said. \u201cForeign investors cannot take that call solo.\u201dSinghal will soon be making that pitch in person. Bank of America is moving its top renewable energy investment banker in India to New York, as it tries to grab a bigger share of what he estimates is the roughly $500 billion needed to meet the country\u2019s green energy targets.He\u2019ll bring with him a slew of roles on recent cross-border deals. Global Power Synergy Pcl, the listed power unit of Thailand\u2019s PTT Group, purchased a $453 million stake in local company Avaada Energy Pvt earlier this month. In September, Japan\u2019s Orix Corp. agreed to buy a roughly 20% stake in Greenko Energy Holdings for $980 million.\u201cThe decade I spent on this sector, which wasn\u2019t considered hot, initially gave BofA and me a first-mover advantage,\u201d he said.Wall Street is a long way from Agra, the northern town where two decades ago, Singhal used to have to line up for about two hours every month to pay the bill for electricity \u2013 which was frequently interrupted. Like Singhal, who has been based in Mumbai, India\u2019s energy sector has moved on. Coal\u2019s market share fell in 2020, the second year in a row, as wind and solar projects become more cost-efficient and the technology improves.The Indian green bond market is expanding rapidly this year with a total of seven issues denominated in foreign currency. Sales jumped to an all-time high of $4.1 billion this year to date, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Despite its presence in renewables M&A, Bank of America is a laggard in arranging green bonds from Indian issuers, the data show. The U.S. lender will work on \u201cfilling that gap\u201d in the business, Singhal said.Local regulations in the power sector are still in flux, making it hard for overseas investors to navigate, and several of them have left. Foreign firms will have a hard time achieving scale by taking part in fiercely fought bidding wars on tariffs, Singhal said. He expects overseas institutional players to invest only in larger companies with the prowess to absorb capital and demonstrate growth, which will quicken the consolidation, he said.Singhal will start at the New York office next month, and will continue to oversee the bank\u2019s renewable deals in India from there.One area where Singhal wasn\u2019t ahead of the curve? His car, which is still gasoline-powered. When he moves to New York, he\u2019ll go electric, he said.",

The tax plan, yet to be legally formalised, will come into force from 2026.India\u2019s new environment minister Bhupender Yadav will virtually participate in the meet that will focus on how to reach a positive outcome at the crucial 26th session of the UN climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UK in November. Environment ministers of G20 nations will also make interventions during the sessions on natural capital to protect the planet and on making joint efforts for sustainable use of resources.Besides raising usual points of concerns like finance and pre-2020 actions of rich nations, India and other countriesare expected to raise the issue of carbon border tax as any such unilateral move may impact their trade in due course of time.\u201cIndia has always held a view that any such unilateral carbon border adjustment will be discriminatory and against the principles of equity and CBDR-RC (common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities),\u201d said an official in the environment ministry.

        "articleBody": "Morocco (one of the top five African economies) is one India\u2019s key strategic partners in Africa and in recent years the partnership has acquired new dimensions and dynamism. Recently the two sides co-chaired the maiden India-Arab energy forum. In a wide-ranging written interview to ET\u2019s Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury following the Forum Moroccan Minister of Energy, Mines & Environment Aziz Rabbah explained that India and Morocco can develop joint projects in the energy sector with great opportunities in renewable energy projects. Rabbah was of the opinion that both countries can jointly undertake electrification projects across Africa. Morocco hosted the first India-Arab energy forum organised under the co-chairship of India and Morocco. What was the main outcome of this meeting and the perspectives of cooperation for both India and Arab countries, especially with Morocco?The Arab countries and India emphasized the need to encourage regional electricity trade, which will allow energy suppliers and market participants to take advantage of economies of scale to develop high capacity systems and access cost-effective supply options that provide more flexibility to access generating capacity from other countries in the regions that are able to meet capacity and power reserve requirements at lower cost. Both sides stressed the need to strengthen Arab-Indian cooperation in energy field in order to accelerate the energy transition through the optimal exploitation of renewable energies, such as solar, wind and green hydrogen, and maximizing the use of fossil fuels in sectors where is no other alternative source of energy. In addition, the two sides expressed the need to strengthen the efforts towards enhancing the energy efficiency programs and activities in various economic activities aiming to achieving sustainable development in the Arab world and India.Many Arab countries have expressed their desire to include the option of electricity generating and sea water desalination with nuclear energy as part of their strategies to diversify energy and water supply resources. Both parties recognize the importance of cooperation and exchange of knowledge and experiences in the field of nuclear energy.India is the third largest consumer of oil in the world and ranks 13th in gas consumption. It is expected that this consumption trend will continue until 2040. Given the limited Indian oil and gas resources and the huge potential of oil and natural gas in the Arab countries, these strengthen the importance of enhancing the relationship between India and the Arab countries in the field of oil and natural gas industry. More important in the field of trade, as India's dependence on oil and gas imports is rapidly increasing in the coming decades, where Arab countries enjoy huge surplus of oil and gas for exports.Both sides expressed the need to exploit the investment opportunities available in the field of energy between the Arab countries and India, and the importance of exchanging experiences in the area of Research and Development (R&D), and enhancing cooperation related to training and capacity building.Morocco has big plans for its energy sector both in renewable and non-renewable sectors. What are the incentives that Morocco offers to foreign investors and how can India partner with morocco in this initiative?Morocco's commitment to an energy transition is a voluntarist political choice made by King Mohammed VI, the King of Morocco, more than a decade ago, through an ambitious energy strategy, based essentially on the rise of renewable energies, the development of energy efficiency and the reinforcement of regional integration, accompanied by a strong orientation of adapted innovation and local component.Seven key factors have been adopted as part of our energy strategy, namely 1)Adequate legal framework, 2) Openness to the private sector, 3) Complementarity of institutional actions, 4) Demand structuring and reliable monitoring, 5) Support for Research and Development, 6)Innovation and industrial integration, as well as 7) Balanced international cooperation supported by such initiatives of international consultation meetings.Morocco has regularly increased its ambition in the development of renewable energy. In 2018, the King, decided to achieve the objective announced by the Kingdom of Morocco at the COP21 by increasing the share of renewable energy to more than 52% in the electricity mix by 2030.Morocco, as part of its sector development renewable energy policy, pays special attention to the revival of investments in the renewable energy sector.To this end, Morocco has planned to grant specific benefits to investors, whose projects will help, firstly, to the qualitative and quantitative development of the renewable energy sector and, secondly, to improve competitiveness of the sector and job creation.For tax incentives, among the measures provided for in the Investment Charter, there are, for certain categories of projects, exemptions or reductions in customs duties, registration fees, participation tax national solidarity, corporate tax, general income tax, tax on real estate profits and tax on licenses.In accordance with the Royal High Orientations, new initiatives have been launched in these recent years to accelerate the Moroccan energy and the economic transition towards a low-carbon model and to meet the socio-economic needs of the population. These include in particular:- Adoption of a roadmap for the development of green hydrogen- Adoption of a roadmap for the energetic valorization of biomass- Elaboration of a roadmap for marine energies - Elaboration of an integrated program of water desalination stations, backed up by renewable energy production units, with the aim of meeting the needs of populations and farmers for drinking water and irrigation- A program to decarbonize national industry by equipping all the industrial zones with renewable energy projects with a total capacity of more than 800 MW ;- A plan for green and integrated equipment of the national network which provides the development of all electricity production projects programmed in renewable energy, as well as the deployment of important investments by the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water for the development and reinforcement of the national electricity network, as well as the modernization of the national electricity dispatching system to improve the monitoring of the intermittent production of renewable projects.About 40 national and international companies from 12 countries are operating in the development of renewable energy projects in Morocco, which confirms the opening of the national market. In order to further strengthen the attractiveness of the national energy model, a legislative and regulatory framework governing renewable energies is underway to enhance transparency, simplify authorization procedures and give investors the necessary visibility in terms of the reception capacity of the electricity system. Morocco has been able to capitalize on this achievement for the consolidation and theincrease of foreign direct investment in the energy sector thanks to a clear legal-institutional framework, which guarantees legal security for investors and donors.The Public Private Partnership (PPP) model has been a viable option to ensure the security of the country's electricity supply. Its development is marked by improvements and optimizations in terms of the Debt / Equity ratio, the contribution of local banks, the guarantees required and the legal framework of the projects. Morocco and India can develop joint projects in the energy sector with great opportunities in the development of renewable energy projects. India has quite an advanced experience in terms of the development of large installations and projects; such experience can be shared and associated at the level of the African continent through Morocco.Morocco and India are important actors in the domain of renewable energies. How can India and Morocco collaborate for the development in electrification projects in Africa? Can\u2019t international solar alliance, which was launched on the margin of cop 22 held in Marrakech in 2016, constitute a very good framework to do it?With more than 15% of the world population, Africa consumes only 3.2% of the primary energy used in the world and nearly 600 million Africans, or about 70% of the population of the continent, had no access to electricity in 2018, Africa needs to add 6 to 7 GW of installed capacity each year to generalize access to electricity by 2030;Currently only 1 to 2 GW are deployed per year, although Africa has enormous potential in renewable energies; the energy, notably the renewables energies are one of the important vectors for boosting cooperation between Morocco and its African counterparts. Moroccan public establishments have always been associated with the implementation of African energy strategies;Morocco is present in Africa via the National Office for Electricity and Potable Water (ONEE) as a main player in the electricity market in Africa thanks to the know-how acquired through its planning experiences, operation, maintenance and rural electrification, combined particularly within the framework of the Global Rural Electrification Program (GREP), a program qualified as successful by international institutions. It also made it possible to generalize access to electricity in record time when the rural electrification rate was only 18% in 1996;Today, ONEE is an operator in several African countries including Senegal, Gambia, Chad, Mauritania, Mali, Sierra Leone and Cape Verde. In renewable energy, Morocco, through the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), puts its expertise in the development of solar energy at the service of many African countries;In order to strengthen the regional and international cooperation, in accordance with King\u2019s vision, the Kingdom of Morocco plays a very active role in the development of international and regional cooperation in the field of energy, in particular in favor of the African continent. In this regard, the Coalition for sustainable access to energy, co-chaired by the Morocco and Ethiopia aiming to generalize access to sustainable energy and particularly to African countries. Morocco has developed an important arsenal of strategic cooperation agreement, which constitutes a real opportunity to meet the challenge of access to energy.In addition, the International Solar Alliance (ISA), of which Morocco became a member after the signing of the framework agreement, on November 19, 2019, by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and the Environment, in accordance with the requirements of article 7 of this agreement, could play a leading role in the development of off-grid renewable energy technologies, an essential element to improve the living conditions of citizens and to ensure security, competitiveness, economic growth and skilled employment.The ISA should further support the creation of an enabling environment for off-grid renewable energy technologies through, in particular, the transfer of technology, know-how and the sharing of the results of innovation resulting from R&D to contribute to the emergence of new products, services and processes.Morocco has made a significant contribution to green and clean energy. how can, in your opinion, Morocco and India join hands to shape global climate change agenda?Despite not being responsible for the problem of climate change, Morocco has drawn up its DCN (Determined Contribution at the National level) with the conviction that global ambitions to tackle the problem of climate change call for a substantial commitment from all parties both in terms of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, cooperation approaches and transparency.In terms of mitigation, Morocco has set a target for reducing GHG (Green House Gases) emissions by 42%, compared to emissions projected for the year 2030. In terms of energy, Morocco plans to reach 52% of the installed electrical power from renewable sources and reduction of energy consumption by 20% by 2030. In fact, Morocco's energy strategy and energy efficiency strategy, both affect advancing the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Due to its strategic geographical location, Morocco continues its active role in accelerating the integration of energy markets, while striving to strengthen its electricity links with its neighbors by developing new electricity links and strengthening existing ones. Morocco continues its active participation in the activation of the joint declaration on sustainable electricity exchanges \u201cSET ROADMAP\u201d, which aims to develop and implement a roadmap for sustainable electricity exchanges between Morocco and Europe. (France, Spain, Portugal and Germany).The European Union has classified Morocco as a key country in the \u201cGreen Deal\u201d initiative under preparation and has shown a huge interest in the Kingdom's experience in the field of renewable energies.Aware of the great importance of cooperation to attract investments, transfer technologies and implement development projects and programs, Morocco attaches great importance to strengthening and developing international cooperation, where the Department of energy continues to cooperate with certain international organizations, organizations and bodies whose objective is to launch or contribute to the implementation of clean energy projects and programs.The energy sector is one of the important areas for strengthening cooperation between Morocco and India. Moroccan public institutions have experience feedback in the implementation of regional energy strategies, by supporting institutions in their different areas of expertise, whether it is planning of supply and demand for electricity, engineering, rural electrification or renewable energies, not to mention capacity building work. Morocco is encouraging foreign investments in the mining sector. India has a huge need for different mines to develop its industry. is there any plan for collaboration between the two countries or to develop a win-win partnership in this important sector?Moroccan mining sector is open to investors. Exploration, research and exploitation activities are carried out under a mining permit or an exploration authorization issued by the Administration in charge of mines.Moroccan government has always been concerned by the establishment of a business climate suitable for investments in the national mining sector. This will have been concretized by the implementation of a renewed strategy aiming at the development of this vital sector. The last strategy was illustrated by the implementation of a plan entitled \u201cPlan Maroc Mines 2021-2030\u201dThis plan, based on a comprehensive approach about the development of an efficient and competitive sector by 2030 working for an integrated industrialization and sustainable growth, is build around four strategic pillars, namely:\u2022 Developing a network of competitive actors;\u2022 Overhaul of the institutional organization of the sector;\u2022 Strengthening the social impact and the responsible and sustainable character of the sector;\u2022 Adapting the legislative framework and financial and fiscal measures to the new ambitions of the sector.These measures are willing to give an impetus to the national mining sector and investment opportunities in terms of exploration, research and exploitation of mining products.In this context, strengthening a collaboration and development of a partnership between Morocco and India in the Moroccan mining sector can be materialized through:\u2022 Participation of Indian mining companies in diverse public calls for competition launched by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Environment concerning granting mining permits in the mining region of Tafilalet and Figuig (South East of Morocco).",

        "articleBody": "Electric bike maker Revolt Motors has said Rajasthan government's EV policy announced last week, which offers subsidies up to Rs 20,000 on the purchase of such vehicles, among others, will hasten the process of electrification besides making these motorcycles more affordable. Rajasthan last week became the 16th state in the country to come out with an EV policy that will subsidise customers of electric vehicles by offering to reimburse SGST (State Goods and Service Tax) besides a one-time incentive based on the battery capacity.  Revolt Motors welcomes the Rajasthan EV Policy 2021, wherein customers of electric two wheelers will get incentives based on battery capacity of vehicle. With battery capacity of 3.24KWh these incentives for Revolt bikes work out to Rs 10,690 per bike, the RattanIndia-backed company said in a statement.  The incentives include refund of State GST amounting to 2.5 per cent of the vehicle cost, it said.  The implementation of Rajasthan Electric Vehicle Policy 2021 will make EV motorcycles more affordable and accessible to consumers in the state, it stated.  These incentives are over and above the FAME II incentives of for EV manufacturers recently announced by the central government which amount to Rs 48,000 per bike in case of Revolt, it said, adding combining these incentives it would mean incentives of at least Rs 58,690 per bike sold by Revolt in Rajasthan.  Of this, while Rs 48,000 will be paid directly by central government to Revolt, Rs 10,690 will be paid directly into the bank account of the customer, it added.  Anjali Rattan, Business Chairman of RattanIndia Enterprises said,  The country expects to have more than 50 lakh e-two wheelers over the next 5 years. These incentives by state governments will certainly expedite reaching that goal.   Rahul Sharma, MD of Revolt Motors said, three big states have come out with EV incentive policies in the last one month alone and more than 20 states are working on release of their incentive schemes.   These incentives schemes show the seriousness of the government to encourage EV adoption. These incentives will certainly accelerate mass EV adoption in the country,  he stated.  With falling battery prices, EV bikes prices are already comparable to their petrol counterparts. Revolt running cost is approximately Rs 9 per 100 kms as compared to petrol bikes which cost Rs 250 per 100 kms, and thereby gives a huge savings on running cost to customers, said the statement.",

        "articleBody": "Union Minister R K Singh on Thursday exuded confidence that India will exceed its target of reducing carbon emission set for 2030 under the Paris agreement.Speaking at the inaugural session of the CII-organised Aatmanirbhar Bharat - Self-Reliance for Renewable Energy Manufacturing Conference, the Power, New and Renewable Energy Minister said that as per its commitment made in Paris, India has to reduce its carbon intensity to 33 per cent by 2030.However, the way energy transition is taking place in India,  ...in the matter of reducing the emission of Co2 will be much much beyond what India has pledged , he added.He further said that as per the Paris agreement, India has to produce 40 per cent electricity of its total capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030. We are already at 39 per cent and if you add the capacities under installation it's already 48 per cent. We are way beyond our NDC (nationally determined contributions) pledges,  the minister said.In his address, Singh expressed dissatisfaction over the approach of some nations towards pledges made under the Paris Agreement.Without naming any country, he said there are countries whose per capita emissions are up to 9 times more than the global average, while India's per capita carbon emission is just about one-third of the global average. I frankly don't see any meaningful step forward towards reducing by these countries\u2026their per capita emission. We hear, talk about pledges of becoming carbon neutral by 2050 but that is meaningless. I sound blunt and harsh but actually, it is meaningless,  he noted.Countries must tell what they will do in the next five years and how they will reduce their per capita emission, the minister said, adding it is something  which nobody is telling .In India, Singh said, energy transition is taking place rapidly and will continue to happen in future as well.The minister had earlier said, ''We (India) are fastest (among all nations) in establishing renewable capacities. But, till all countries don't come together, we can't reduce global warming''. ",

        "articleBody": "The Earth Sciences Ministry's 2021-2026 plan will have a weather forecasting programme for wind and solar energy sectors where weather plays a crucial role, a senior official said on Wednesday. Addressing a workshop on 'Meteorology Forecast for Wind and Solar Energy Generation: Current Status and Perspective', Earth Sciences Ministry secretary M Rajeevan said there are challenges in weather prediction for wind and solar energy sectors.  The MoES has a good programme for 2021-2026 for activities related to weather forecast for wind and solar energy sector,  he said. The 2021-2026 plan has an outlay of what major projects the ministry will undertake during this period. Rajeevan also asked the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (NCMRWF), both under the MoES, to take the lead in this.  We also recognise the difficulty in meeting the requirements of wind and solar energy sectors because you need daily localised and location-specific forecast. You also need a very high-frequency forecast of every 15 minutes or so,  he said. Rajeevan said forecasting for the wind energy sector becomes especially difficult in hilly areas where windmills are installed. As far as solar energy is concerned, it is very easy to give a forecast for 24-48 hours in a clear sky. But when it comes to cloudy sky, aerosols clouding, the forecast can go wrong, he pointed out.  So we have challenged (ourselves) from our side to meet the requirement of the wind and energy sectors,  he said. The workshop was attended by industry representatives.",

        "articleBody": "The Maharashtra government on Tuesday announced its new electric vehicle (EV) policy with an aim of making such vehicles achieve 10 per cent share of total registrations by 2025. The new policy, which has updated the one announced in 2018, was released by Additional Chief Secretary (Transport) Ashish Singh and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and others here.  The policy has some ambitious targets. Electric vehicles must comprise at least 10 per cent of total vehicles registered by 2025. We also want to achieve 25 per cent EV share in public transport in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik. It includes converting 15 per cent of the MSRTC fleet into EVs by 2025. We also intend to make Maharashtra the top producer of battery driven EVs in India in terms of annual production capability,  Singh said. He said another target laid down in the new policy was to establish one gigawatt of battery manufacturing capability in the state. Speaking on the occasion, minister Thackeray said the conventional fuel-based passenger vehicle market may be hesitant as engines are getting upgraded in Euro-IV and V models but a major change can be brought about in the public transport sector by tapping MSRTC and civic-run undertakings for the EV initiative. The Union government's FAME-II policy and Maharashtra's new EV policy can be combined for greater effectiveness. We are trying to set up EV charging stations in these five major cities though several incentives, with residential and office areas being on the priority list to set up EV charging stations,  Thackeray said. He brushed aside a query on whether EV manufacturer Tesla was being contacted by the state government to be part of this sector by claiming that  a state cannot endorse a single car making company .  We are in talks with all EV makers. Some 73-74 per cent ancillary makers of such vehicles are in Maharashtra. If any company conducts a study, they will naturally find Maharashtra a preferred destination in terms of ancillary suppliers as well as purchasers of such vehicles,  the minister said.",

        "articleBody": "The Maharashtra Government on Tuesday announced a new electric vehicles (EV) promotion policy which provides subsidies to buyers to drive up demand for EVs in the state.The Maharashtra EV Policy 2021 will provide incentives of Rs 5,000 per kilowatt-hour of battery capacity to buyers of all types of electric vehicles. The subsidy will be directly transferred to the beneficiaries within 30 days.For those who buy EVs by 31 December this year, there will be an additional \u2018early bird discount\u2019 of Rs 5,000 per kilowatt-hour. The scheme is valid till 31 March 2025 and by then aims to convert 10% of all new vehicles sold in the state to electric. It also aims to convert 25% of all last-mile logistics vehicles to electric.The policy also includes waiver of road tax and registration charges for vehicles sold under the policy. Other demand-side incentives include providing incentives to manufacturers to extend 5-year warranty for the batteries and assured buyback schemes to bolster consumer confidence.Scrappage of old combustion engine vehicles to buy EVs would also be incentivised. However, with the caveat that the manufacturer of the new EV purchased would also have to match the scrappage subsidy given by the government.This comes after Delhi and Gujarat governments announced their own state EV policies that had demand-side incentives on top of the Centre\u2019s FAME-2 (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric vehicles) scheme.The EV industry expects these demand-incentives to shore up sales significantly.These measures could help bridge the gap between consumers being aware about EVs and them willing to buy these vehicles, according to Sohinder Gill, Director General, Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV) which is an EV industry lobby.Beyond subsidies for buyers, Maharashtra\u2019s EV policy also includes incentives for setting up public 15,000 slow and 500 fast public chargers in the state.Moreover, benefits under the D+ category of mega projects will be provided to new EV and related manufacturing units set up in the state. The state government wants to attract at least one Gigafactory for the manufacturing of advanced cells, which is part of the production-linked incentives scheme announced by New Delhi.",

        "articleBody": "India can\u2019t prioritize eliminating greenhouse gas emissions without sufficient financing from richer nations to help offset the high cost of transitioning to clean energy, according to a senior government official.In laying out its position ahead of key global climate talks later this year, the top bureaucrat in India\u2019s environment ministry also said the country doesn\u2019t plan to tighten its emissions goals unless more money is promised from developed economies under the United Nations-sponsored climate change agreement.  84335557\u201cEvery policy decision has a cost to the economy. Going net-zero or using less carbon also has a cost,\u201d Environment Secretary Rameshwar Prasad Gupta said in an interview at his New Delhi office. \u201cWe are not anti-net-zero. But without adequate climate finance being definitively available, we can\u2019t commit on that part.\u201dThe stance by India, the world\u2019s third-biggest emitter, highlights a top challenge global leaders will face when they meet at the UN Climate Change Conference, which starts in late October in Glasgow. While cutting net global carbon emissions to zero by 2050 is key to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, aimed at avoiding catastrophic damage from climate change, figuring out how to pay for the transition toward clean energy has been a sticking point.Gupta also said the current $100 billion-a-year pledge by richer nations to help developing nations -- a target they haven\u2019t even met yet -- is insufficient to make the shift.\u201cWe have our own developmental imperatives,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cIf you want that I don\u2019t emit carbon, then provide finance. It will be much more than $100 billion per year for developing nations.\u201dAs well, until negotiations are finalized around funding help, India likely won\u2019t upgrade the emissions targets it committed to in 2015, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution, which under the Paris Agreement were expected to be revised by 2020.\u201cThis is not the final decision, but most probably we won\u2019t file a revised NDC,\u201d he said. \u201cLet there be a decision on climate finance first.\u201dWhile the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed setting a 2050 net-zero emissions goal earlier this year, policy makers have resisted, citing the outsized role fossil fuels play in powering its growing population out of poverty, and the progress it\u2019s made on earlier climate commitments.But India risks looking like an outlier among other developing economies. While still seeking more funds from richer states, more than 100 countries including large emerging economies like Mexico, as well as neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh, have publicly committed to zero carbon by mid-century. Even China, previously one of the strongest voices calling on developed nations to do more, has changed its tune, aiming to decarbonize the world\u2019s top polluter by 2060.Meanwhile, Brazil has also made its commitment contingent on richer nations, saying net-zero is only possible if it can guarantee $10 billion-per-year in contributions from other countries.As India recovers from the pandemic-induced economic contraction, it sees international finance as key to industry overhaul needed to lower emissions. This includes banishing coal, a dirty but cheap source of energy, currently being used for about 70% of its power generation. Solutions also include replacing coal with more-expensive and untested alternatives, such as green hydrogen, in heavy industries like steel and oil refining.Economic ImpactWhile the green transition does present infrastructure-driven economic growth opportunities, there would be trade-offs in the form of higher electricity prices and rail fares, job losses in the coal sector and fiscal challenges for states, according to an analysis by Vaibhav Chaturvedi, a fellow at the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water.However, there are also longer-term costs for inaction. India\u2019s loss in per-capita gross domestic product by 2050 could range from 0.41%, under a low-global warming scenario if the Paris Agreement is met, to 5.08% in case of higher warming, the International Monetary Fund estimated in 2019.The global climate talks in Scotland later this year, known as COP26, are seen as the last chance to set a plan to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The British government is hoping the summit will deliver an agreement by all countries to abandon coal power, with the G-7 leading the way.While India may not set new goals before the meeting, Gupta said it\u2019s on track to exceed 2030 targets it set in 2015, including that the country\u2019s share of non-fossil fuel power generation capacity rises to 40%. It\u2019s also on course to cut its emissions intensity by a third from 2005 levels by 2023, seven years ahead of schedule, he said.",

        "articleBody": "The Rajasthan government is looking to make the state a leader in the renewable energy sector, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said on Friday. To accelerate the projects related to the development of renewable energy, the state government has implemented the Rajasthan Solar Energy Policy-2019 and Solar-Wind Hybrid Energy Policy-2019, Gehlot said in a statement.  He said that the policies have encouraged investment in renewable energy and setting up of mega solar park projects in the state.  Gehlot was addressing online meeting of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. He said that the corporation should try to achieve the target of 30,000 MW of solar power and 7,500 MW of wind and hybrid energy generation for the state by 2024-25.  The chief minister said that the geographical conditions of the state are conducive to solar power generation and there is immense potential in the alternative energy sector.  He said that Rajasthan has the potential to generate 2.7 lakh MW of solar and wind energy.   We have to work with new thinking and technology towards achieving this goal. This will not only make the state a big hub in the field of energy, but it will also make it possible to create huge employment opportunities,  He said.  The Chief Minister said that recently the state government has approved customised packages for some big power projects in the state, which is likely to attract an investment of about Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the state.  Gehlot said that coordination should be done with the central government to remove the hurdles in the implementation of Kusum scheme so that farmers who want to set up solar power plants in their land can get loans from financial institutions at low interest rates without collateral security.",

        "articleBody": "India is making rules that will encourage companies to switch entirely to renewable power, a key step toward decarbonizing the nation\u2019s fossil fuel-dominated economy.The new regulations will allow companies to purchase renewable electricity from state distributors at \u201cgreen tariffs,\u201d Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh said at the virtual BloombergNEF summit on Tuesday. Hurdles for businesses seeking to buy clean power directly from generators will also be eased, he said.Accelerating use of clean energy in offices and factories, the largest power consuming segment in the country, will be key to achieving targets to cut emissions per unit of the GDP. It will also help the companies improve their environment, social and governance -- or ESG -- scores by reducing their carbon footprint.Those opting for green power will be allowed open access -- when they aren\u2019t tied down to the local distributor -- within 15 days, instead of having to wait for months, Singh said. That would force state utilities to either meet the demand or risk losing their high-value customers.Providing time-bound open access, though a \u201cwelcome move,\u201d may be fraught with challenges, according to Debasish Mishra, a Mumbai-based partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.Industrial buyers pay the highest prices for grid electricity and help utilities subsidize poorer consumers. Cash-strapped distributors, already facing precarious finances, often resist losing these customers to other suppliers.\u201cHigh open-access charges can often create barriers for consumers to directly access green power,\u201d Mishra said. \u201cAnd as per law, that\u2019s under the jurisdiction of state electricity regulators who would want to balance the interest of the incumbent utility.\u201dOffshore WindSeparately, India will promote offshore wind projects to get to its 2030 goal of 450 gigawatts of renewables capacity, a near fivefold expansion from current levels. That would include 280 gigawatts of solar and 140 gigawatts of wind capacity, the minister said.Singh cited scarcity of land as one of the challenges for ramping up wind power and said offshore projects will help deal with the issue. The cost of such projects will initially be high and the government is exploring capital subsidies to help developers, he said.India will fall short of its renewable capacity goal of 175 gigawatts by the next year due to \u201csome hiccups,\u201d Singh said, potentially linked to the pandemic. The country has had to extend deadlines for renewable projects due to difficulties in importing equipment and getting workers at construction sites.",
